	|1-21.~  To illustrate the madness with which two 
counterfeiters of others' persons are afflicted, the insanity of
two classical personages, Athamas and Hecuba, is described. 

	|2-3.  Per Semel@e~: because of Jupiter's amour with Semele,
daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes.  |una ed altra fiata~:
another instance, besides that which Dante proceeds to give, is
the murder of Pentheus by his mother Agave, Semele's sister,
which Juno caused; Ov. ^Met.~ iii. ^ad fin.~ 

	|4.  Atamante~, &c.: Athamas, king of Thebes, was struck 
with madness by Juno, because his wife Ino brought up Bacchus, 
Semele's son by Jupiter.  The story, including the deaths of his
wife and children, is taken from Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 511 foll., and
the resemblance between the two passages is very close, extending
even to some of the expressions used; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p.
212. 

	|8.  al varco~: `at the passage,' i.e. where they have to
pass; in Ovid it is, `his retia tendite silvis,' l. 512. 

	|12.  l' altro carco~: the other child's name was
Melicertes. 

	|16-18.  Ecuba~: the story of Hecuba is given in Ov. ^Met.~
xiii. 403 foll., where `Troia simul Priamusque cadunt,' l. 404,
corresponds to l. 15 here.  |cattiva~: `captive.'  |Polissena~:
Polyxena, daughter of Hecuba. was offered in sacrifice to appease
the shade of Achilles.  |Polidoro~: Polidorus, son of Hecuba, was
murdered by Polymestor, king of Thrace, to whose keeping Priam
had entrusted him, after which his body was found by Hecuba on
the shore.  Polydorus has already been referred to in connexion
with Inf. xiii. 31.

	|20.  latr@o~: cp. Ov. ^Met.~ xiii. 569, `Latravit conata
loqui.' 

	|22-24.  furie~: `bursts of frenzy.'  |in alcun~: `in the 
heart of any one'; that this is the meaning is shown by ^in due 
ombre~, l. 25.  |Non punger bestie~: take with |tanto crude~; `so
cruel in goading beasts': |Non~ is resumptive from |n@e...n@e~ 
above. 

	|27.  si schiude~: `is let out.' 

	|28.  nodo del collo~: `nape of the neck.' 

	|31-33.  l' Aretin~: Griffolino; cp. Inf. xxix. 109. 
|folletto~: `sprite.'  |Gianni Schicchi~: this person was an 
extraordinary mimic, and when the thief Buoso Donati (cp. Inf.
xxv. 140) died, and his son Simone was afraid that he might have
left his money in such a way as to make amends to persons whom he
had robbed, Schicchi personated him as if he was on his deathbed,
and dictated to a notary a will in favour of Simone and himself.
|conciando~: `harrying,' lit. `trimming,' `giving a dressing to.' 

	|34-36.  se~, &c.: `so may not the other of these two
spirits gore thee,' as Gianni Schicchi has gored Capocchio.  |si
spicchi~: `darts off,' lit. `detaches himself.'  The word
expresses the movement of the mad spirits; so ^spiccare un salto~
is `to turn a summerset.' 

	|38.  Mirra~: Ov. ^Met.~ x. 298 foll.  She professed to be
another girl; `Nomine mentito veros exponit amores,' l. 439. 

	|42-45.  l' altro~: Gianni Schicchi.  |sostenne~: take 
with |Falsificare~, l. 44, `persevered in counterfeiting'; the
word implies that it was an elaborate process.  |la donna della
torma~: `the queen of the herd'; this was a handsome mule
belonging to Buoso Donati, which Schicchi claimed as part of the
price of his roguery.  |norma~: `legal form.' 

	|48.  mal nati~: `born in an evil hour': cp. Inf. v. 7. 

	|49-51.  Io vidi~, &c.: the person who is now described is
an example of a false coiner.  |a guisa di liuto~, &c.: `so that
he would have resembled a lute, if his legs had been cut off at
the groin,' lit. `if he had had the groin cut off towards the
forked part of man.' 

	|52-54.  dispaia~: `disproportions,' by making the face 
lean and the belly distended, l. 54.  |che mal converte~: `which
assimilates (neut.) amiss.' 

	|55.  a~: used after ^fare~; cp. Inf. xxix. 117. 

	|61.  maestro Adamo~: Master Adam of Brescia, a coiner of 
counterfeit money was instigated by Count Guido II of Romena, and
his brothers Alessandro and Aginolfo, to issue adulterated coins,
counterfeiting the golden florin of Florence.  For this he was 
burnt by the Florentines in 1281. 

	|65.  Casentin~: Romena, the scene of his crime, was a
village in the Casentino in the upper valley of the Arno. 

	|70-72.  fruga~: `chastises,' lit. `goads.'  |A metter~, 
&c.: `to give wings to my sighs,' i.e. to cause me to vent 
them. 

	|74.~  La |lega~, &c.: `the currency stamped with the 
Baptist'; the Florentine gold coins bore the figure of St. John 
the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence.  The first meaning of
|lega~ is `legal standard of coinage' (Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 191); 
hence it signifies `currency.'  Later it is used for `alloy,' as
in Par. ii. 139. 

	|78.  Per fonte Branda~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `I would 
not exchange the pleasure of seeing them enduring the same
torment as I am for that of drinking at an ample fountain.'  As 
they were the cause of his ruin, he desired to enjoy his
vengeance.  |fonte Branda~ is the great fountain at Siena, which
is enclosed within a large and deep marble basin, and supplied 
with water by four channels.  By some it is supposed to be a 
fountain of that name, now dried up, near Romena, and there is 
said to be some documentary evidence to show that this spring 
existed at an early time (see Casini).  It is not, however, 
mentioned by the early commentators, and the fountain at Siena 
from its volume of water would be a typical instance of a copious
source, such as a thirsty man would have in his mind. 

	|79-80.  Dentro~ c' @e l' una: `within this ^bolgia~ is 
one of them.'  Probably Guido is meant, but the dates of their 
deaths are not certainly known.  |Ombre~: those of Schicchi and 
Mirra. 

	|84.  sarei messo~: `would have started'; the full phrase 
is ^mettersi in cammino.~ 

	|86-87.  ella volge~, &c.: `its circuit is eleven miles,'
i.e. that of the |gente sconcia~, and consequently of the
^bolgia~ which contains them.  On this line see note to Inf. 
xxix. 9.  |men d' un mezzo~, &c.: `it is not less than half a 
mile across.' 

	|90.  Che avean~: as |avean~ is metrically a disyllable, in
order to make this line scan |Che~ must be unelided.  Witte,
Casini, and Toynbee read ^Che avean ben~, Scartazzini ^Che 
avevan.~  |mondiglia~: `base metal,' lit. `refuse.'  The legal 
standard was 24 carats of gold; those which he struck had only 
21. 

	|92-93.  come man bagnate~: `like hands which steam after
having been dipped in water.'  |stretti~, &c.: `close together
just on your right hand.' 

	|95.  piovvi~: `was flung down,' cp. Inf. xxiv. 122.
|greppo~: `chasm.' 

	|97-98.  la falsa~: Potiphar's wife; Gen. xxxix. 7 foll. 
She and Sinon represent the class of perjurers.  |Sinon~: the 
treacherous Greek, who by his false tale persuaded the Trojans to
admit the wooden horse within their walls.

	|100-102.~  The cross-fire of coarse repartee between Sinon
and Master Adam which follows, like the scene in Canto XXII
between the devil and the jobber, is probably intended to lighten
the strain on the feelings in this part of the poem.  |si rec@o a
noia~: `became annoyed.'  |oscuro~: `darkly,' i.e. with
discredit, being called ^falso.~  |croia~: `hard.' 

	|110.  cos@i presto~: `so ready for use'; the criminal at the
stake had his arms bound.  The reference is to his death by
burning; see note on l. 61. 

	|114.  del ver~, &c.: `you were asked about the truth'; cp.
Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 149, where Priam says to him, `mihique haec
edissere vera roganti.'  |Troia~: this word must be scanned as a
monosyllable. 

	|115.  e tu~: `yet thou'; |e~ here expresses contrast: cp.
Inf. xix. 3 and note; Purg. iv. 90. 

	|118-120.  cavallo~: the wooden horse.  |siati reo che~: `be
it rueful to thee, that.' 

	|121-123.  te~: this word is to be regarded as a repetition
of ^ti~ in ^siati~ preceding; this explains the omission of ^a~ 
before it.  A few MSS. read ^A te.~  |Che il ventre~, &c.: `which
thus raises thy belly like a hedge in front of thine eyes,' i.e.
causes it to obstruct thy sight. 

	|124-125.  Cosi~, &c.: `by saying that, thou openest thy
lips to thy own detriment'; the meaning is, that he gives an 
opportunity for retort: this explains ^Ch@e~ in l. 126.  |si 
squarcia~: `opens wide,' lit. `rends itself.' 

	|128.  lo specchio di Narcisso~: a pool of water, with
reference to the fable of Narcissus having pined away for love of
his own face reflected in water; Ov. ^Met.~ iii. 407 foll. 

	|131.  Or pur mira~: `aye, look your fill,' lit. `now do 
nothing but look'; see note on Inf. xxix. 4.

	|135.  si gira~: `it eddies through my memory.' 

	|136.  quale @e quei~ &c.: the point of the comparison here
is, that the person has attained what he desires without being
conscious of it.  The man who has a painful dream, longs in his
dream that it may be a dream and not a reality; and this is the
case, though he is unaware of it.  Dante, while feeling unable
through lack of words to excuse himself, longs to be able to do
so, and unconsciously effects his object by his shame and
silence.  This is a conspicuous instance of an interesting class
of similes -- viz. those drawn from mental experiences -- of
which there are as many as thirty in the ^Div. Com.~ 

	|145-147.  fa ragion~: `consider'; cp. Par. xxvi. 8.  |che 
fortuna t'accoglia~: `that chance finds (lit. greets) thee,' 
i.e. `that thou chancest to be.'  |piato~: `dispute,' lit. `law- 
suit.'  This word, like Engl. `plea' (Skeat), is the Low Lat. 
^placitum~, as used in the law-courts.  Ducange gives as one of 
the meanings of ^placitum~, `lis intentata,' and of ^placitare~,
`lite contendere.'
