	|1.  Vexilla~, &c.: this is an adaptation of the Passion
Hymn of Fortunatus, Bp. of Poitiers in Cent. vi, which commences, 
`Vexilla regis prodeunt, Fulget crucis mysterium.' 

	|7.  un tal 'dificio~: here, as in the case of the Giants 
(see note on Inf. xxxi. 31), an unusually surprising object is 
introduced by the aid of an intermediate stage in description. 

	|9.  grotta~: `hiding-place,' `shelter'; whether this 
meaning is derived from that of `cave' or that of `rock' is not 
certain. 

	|11.  tutte~: `altogether'; cp. Inf. xix. 64; xxxi. 15. 

	|13-15.  sono a giacere~: `are lying.'  |Quella...quella~: 
the clauses marked by these words are connected in meaning with 
|erte~; `others are in a perpendicular position, one with his 
head, one with his soles upward.'  The meaning of the four 
positions given in these lines is thus explained.  Those who lie
flat are such as have betrayed benefactors who were on the same 
level in society with them.  Those who are in a perpendicular 
position, if they stand head upwards, have been traitors to 
benefactors inferior to them in station, if head downwards, to 
such as were superior to them.  Those who have betrayed 
benefactors both inferior and superior to them, have both their 
head and their feet downward, so that they assume the form of an
arc. 

	|18.  ebbe~: i.e. before his fall; cp. l. 34. 

	|19-20.  Dinanzi~, &c.: `he moved from before me'; Dante had
sheltered himself behind Virgil, l. 8.  |Dite~: this name is the
classical equivalent of Lucifer, inasmuch as he is `Lo imperador
del doloroso regno,' l. 28.  Dis, it should be remembered, is the
proper Latin name of this divinity, that of Pluto having been
borrowed from the Greek. 

	|22.  fioco~: `weak.' 

	|26.  fior d' ingegno~: `aught of wit.'  The origin of this
meaning of |fior~ is, that in early Italian ^fiore~, `a flower,'
is used for `a slight thing.'  ^Fior~ is sometimes a substantive,
as here and in Purg. iii. 135, `fior del verde'; sometimes an
adverb, as in Inf. xxv. 144, `se fior la penna abborra.' 

	|27.  d' uno e d' altro~: `both of life and death.' 

	|30-31.  io mi convegno~: `I correspond to,' `reach the 
measure of'; `I approach nearer to the stature of a giant, than 
the giants reach the measure of his arms.' 

	|33.  parte~: the arms. 

	|34-36.  S' ei fu~, &c.: the meaning is -- `If he was once 
exceeding fair, and then defied his Maker, well may he be the 
primary source of woe to men.'  ^Corruptio optimi pessima~: the 
same gifts which were resplendent in him before his fall, would 
produce intense malice and injuriousness after it. 

	|38.  tre facce~: the three faces form a sort of antitype 
to the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity.  The most probable 
view of their allegorical meaning is, that the pale sallow face 
denotes ^impotence~, the black face ^ignorance~, the red face 
^wrathful hatred~, these three qualities being the antithesis of
those represented by the Persons of the Trinity. viz. ^power, 
wisdom~, and ^love~, as set forth by Dante in Inf. iii. 5, 6, 
where see note. 

	|41.  Sopr' esso il mezzo~: `just over the middle.'  |Esso~,
Lat. ^ipse~, when it is used indeclinable, as here, and placed
between the prep. and its case, adds precision to the statement;
cp. Inf. xxiii. 54, `Sopresso noi'; Purg. xxxi. 96, `Sopr' esso
l' acqua'; Purg. ii. 10, `lunghesso il mare.' 

	|42.  si giungieno~, &c.: `the three faces met at the
crown,' lit. `the place where the crest is' in birds. 

	|45.  l@a~: Ethiopia.  The Ethiopians are the typical black
race.  |s' avvalla~: `flows down,' der. from Lat. ^ad, vallis~;
cp. ^avvalliamo~, `let us descend,' in Purg. viii. 43. 

	|56.  maciulla~: `a brake,' or instrument for breaking hemp
or flax. 

	|59-60.  Verso il graffiar~: `in comparison of the clawing.' 
Judas thus had the severest punishment, being torn by Lucifer's
claws as well as by his teeth.  |brulla~: `bare'; in Inf. xvi. 30
the form is ^brollo.~ 

	|66.  non fa motto~: as being defiant of pain, like Capaneus
in Inf. xiv. 46. 

	|67.  membruto~: `large of limb.'  It has been suggested
that Dante derived this view of C. Cassius, Caesar's murderer, by
mistake from what Cicero says (^Cat.~ iii. 7. 16) of L. Cassius,
`L. Cassii adipes'; but the expressions do not very closely 
correspond.  Plutarch -- with whose writings Dante was not 
acquainted -- implies that he was pale and somewhat weakly;
^Caes.~, {para.} 62; ^Brut.~, {para.} 29. 

	|68.  la notte risurge~: in like manner when the Poets 
entered the Inferno we are told, `Lo giorno se n' andava,' Inf. 
ii. 1; consequently twenty-four hours had now been spent there. 
The present time is nightfall of Easter Eve, whereas they entered
at nightfall on Good Friday. 

	|70-85.~  The process which is now described is this.  Dante
puts his arms round Virgil's neck, and Virgil lets himself down
by the shocks of hair on Lucifer's body until he reaches his 
waist, where is the centre of gravity of the earth; there he
turns round, so that his head is where his feet had been, and 
then he climbs up in the opposite direction, holding on to 
Lucifer as before, until he reaches a passage through the rocks 
which here close in. 

	|71.  poste~: `points of vantage,' i.e. the right moment and
the right part of Lucifer's body, as is explained in the two
following lines. 

	|74.  Di vello in vello~: `from one shock of hair to
another.' 

	|76-77.  l@a dove~, &c.: `by the thigh joint (|dove la
coscia Si volge~) just where the haunch is thickest.' 

	|81.  anche~: `once more.'  Having passed the centre of 
gravity, and having turned round, they were now ascending in the
opposite direction: of this Dante was not yet aware. 

	|82.  Attienti ben~: `hold fast by me.' 

	|87.  Appresso~, &c.: `thereupon he advanced towards me 
hi wary step.'  After first depositing Dante, Virgil lets go of 
Lucifers' hair, and reaches a safe foothold on the rock. 

	|90.  vidili: li~ is here used for ^lo.~ 

	|91-93.  s' io divenni~, &c.: the meaning is -- `those 
will best understand my perplexity, who, like the uneducated 
masses, are ignorant of the centre of gravity'; lit. `let the 
dull folk, who know nothing of the point which I had passed, 
conceive whether I now became perplexed.'  |travagliato~: this 
word is derived from Lat. ^trabs~, `a beam,' through the 
(hypothetical) Low Lat. ^travare~, `to build with beams,' `pen 
in,' `embarrass'; Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `travail.' 

	|96.  il sole~: the sun, whose name has been avoided during
their passage through Hell, is now once more mentioned, since
they have escaped from that place.  |a mezza terza riede~:
`returns halfway to the third hour'; |terza~ was the name of the
first of the four divisions of the twelve hours of the day, 
computed from sunrise; consequently, if we reckon sunrise as 6
a.m., |mezza terza~ will be 7.30 a.m.  There is no contradiction
between this and l. 68, where the time is given as nightfall, 
because here we are supposed to be in the southern hemisphere, 
where consequently it is morning, ll. 105, 118.  The time has 
gone back (cp. |riede~) twelve hours, and Easter Eve is now 
beginning for the southern hemisphere; see Moore,
^Time-References~, p. 50. 

	|97-99.  camminata~: `chamber'; strictly the word means `a 
room with a hearth in it (^camera caminata~)'; cp. the ^Consulte
Fiorentine~ for Feb. 22, 1279, `congregatis dominis xii+cim~.... 
in pallatio Comunis in ^caminata~ Potestatis.'  In the present 
passage the antithesis is between a palace-chamber and a dungeon
(|burella~).  |disagio~: `deficiency.' 

	|104.  poc' ora~: `short time'; cp. Purg. ii. 93, ^tanta 
ora~, `so long time.' 

	|108.  vermo~: `worm,' i.e. loathsome reptile; cp. Inf. vi.
22, of Cerberus.  |fora~: `pierces,' i.e. passes from one part to
the other, being partly in both hemispheres. 

	|109.  cotanto quant' io scesi~: `for so long as I was 
descending.' 

	|110-111.~  il punto, &c.: the centre of gravity; cp.
^Conv.~ iii. 3. ll. 10, 11, `la terra sempre discende al centro.'
The authority for this doctrine was Aristotle, ^De Caelo~, iv. 1.
7. 

	|112-115.  l' emisperio~: by this is meant the southern 
hemisphere, while that to which it is |contrapposto~ is the 
northern hemisphere.  `The great continent' (|la gran secca~)
which covers the latter of these is the dry land on its surface;
and in Dante's time all the dry land on the face of the globe was
supposed to be confined to that hemisphere.  The |colmo~ or 
`culminating point' of the northern hemisphere is the zenith of 
Jerusalem, the scene of our Lord's death, for that place was 
regarded as the centre of the habitable world.  This last idea 
seems to have been derived from Ezek. v. 5, `This is Jerusalem: I
have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round
about her.' 

	|116-121.~  Virgil here answers more specifically Dante's 
three questions (ll. 103-5) about (1) the position of the ice, 
(2) the sudden change from evening to morning, (3) the position 
of Lucifer. 

	|116-117.  Tu hai~, &c.: the answer to the first question
is, that the ice of the ring of the Giudecca forms a small circle
on the one side of the centre, and the rock on which Dante now is
(ll. 85, 56) forms a small circular space corresponding to this
on the other (|Che l' altra faccia fa~). 

	|118.  da man~: see note on Inf. i. 37. 

	|121-122.  Da questa parte~: on the side of the southern 
hemisphere.  |si sporse~: `rose out of the sea.'  According to 
the story here given, which appears to have been Dante's own 
invention, there was originally land in the southern hemisphere,
and when Lucifer fell there, this sank through fear of him, and 
reappeared in the northern hemisphere. 

	|125-126.  Per fuggir~, &c.: `to escape from him, the earth
which is seen on this side of the globe (i.e. that which forms
the Mountain of Purgatory) left its place void, and rushed
upwards.'  This is suggested to explain the formation of the
chasm through which the Poets now ascend to the upper air, and at
the same time that of the Mountain of Purgatory, which rises
above, and which is supposed to have been formed by the earth
thus thrown up. 

	|127-128.  Loco @e~, &c.: these two lines are a description
of the cavity by which the ascent is made.  `In the heart of the
earth there is a place, which reaches away as far from Lucifer
(|Belzeb@u~) in one direction as Hell extends in the other'; both
of them reach from the centre to the circumference of the earth. 
|laggi@u~: `below'; Dante speaks from the point of view of one on
the earth's surface.  |la tomba~: the Inferno generally, which is
called ^fossa~ in Inf. xiv. 136. 

	|129.  non per vista~: it is invisible in the darkness. 

	|130.  un ruscelletto~: this rivulet is generally regarded
as being formed by the water of Lethe, which flows from the
summit of the mountain of Purgatory; and the idea that the sins
that are washed away from the memory by Lethe should pass into
Hell is a natural one.  But there is no evidence in the poem to
show that the two streams are connected with one another; indeed,
in Inf. xiv. 136, 137 Virgil clearly intimates that Dante would
not see Lethe before he reached the Earthly Paradise. 

	|132.  Col corso ch' egli avvolge~: `in its tortuous
course.'  |poco pende~: `has not a steep fall'; the subject is 
^che~ in l. 130. 

	|137.  Tanto che~: `until.'  |delle cose belle~: `some of 
the beauteous objects,' i.e. some of the stars; afterwards they 
see the whole array of stars.  

	|139.  le stelle~: from Purg. i. 13-21 we learn that these
were the stars of early morning, so that the time might be about
5 a.m.; and as it was 7.30 a.m. on the previous morning when they
commenced the ascent (^supra~, l. 96), the ascent would have
occupied about 21 hours; see Moore, ^Time-Ref.~, p. 53.  On the
force of the word |stelle~, with which each of the three
^Cantiche~ of the poem ends, see note on Par. xxxiii. 145.
