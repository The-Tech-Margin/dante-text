	|2-3.  fiche~: this insulting gesture consists in thrusting
the thumb between the first and middle fingers.  |Togli~: `take
that.'  |squadro~: `level,' `point.' 

	|4.  Da indi in qua~, &c.: `from that time forth the 
serpents were endeared to me.' 

	|9.  un crollo~: `a jerk,' referring to the movement of 
the thumbs.  This serpent hindered him from his blasphemous 
gestures, as the other had from his blasphemous words. 

	|10-11.  ch@e non stanzi~, &c.: `why dost thou hesitate 
(lit. `dost thou not settle,' `determine') to reduce thyself to 
ashes?' with reference to what had just happened to Vanni Fucci,
who was a citizen of Pistoia; Inf. xxiv. 100-2, 126. 

	|12.  lo seme tuo avanzi~: `thou surpassest the seed from 
which thou didst spring,' i.e. the gang of Catiline.  It was 
believed at that time that Pistoia was founded by the remains of
Catiline's army; Villani, i. 32.  For |seme~ meaning
`progenitors' cp. Par. vii. 86. 

	|15.  quel che~, &c.: Capaneus, Inf. xiv. 46, where see 
note. 

	|17.  un Centauro~: we learn from l. 25 that this is the 
monstrous giant Cacus, who lived in a cave on the Aventine Hill,
and stole the cattle of Hercules when he passed by that way; 
Virg. ^Aen.~ viii. 193 foll.  The epithet `half-human' (= half- 
savage), which Virgil applies to him (`Semihominis Caci,' l. 
194), seems to have misled Dante into the idea that he was a 
Centaur. 

	|19-21.  Maremma~: the marshy and uncultivated district 
between the mountains of Tuscany and the sea; see note on Inf. 
xiii. 9.  |nostra labbia~: `the human form,' i.e. the fore-part 
of the Centaur, in contrast with |groppa~, which is the hind- 
quarters.  |labbia~, which elsewhere in the ^Div. Com.~:
signifies the look of the face, from meaning `aspect' comes here
to be used for `form.' 

	|24.  affoca~: in Virgil it is Cacus himself who is
described as `Ore vonens ignes,' ^Aen.~ viii. 199. 

	|26-27.  il sasso~: i.e. his cave.  |Di sangue~, &c.: Virg.
^Aen.~ viii. ll. 195, 196, `semperque recenti Caede tepebat
humus.' |laco~: ^lago~ for a `pool' of blood is found in 
Purg. v. 84. 

	|28-30.  co, suoi fratei~: the other Centaurs were in the 
Circle of the violent, Inf. xii. 55 foll.  |lo furar che
frodolente fece~: this is Cacus' deceitful stratagem of dragging
the oxen backwards that their footprints might convey a false 
idea of the direction they were following, Virg. ^Aen.~ viii. 
l. 210.  |frodolente~ is here an adv.; others read ^lo furar 
frodolente che fece~, in which case it is an adj.  |ch' egli ebbe
a vicino~: `which were in his (Cacus') neighbourhood.'  Virgil 
describes (l. 204) how Hercules' drove occupied a valley near the
Aventine. 

	|31-33.  biece~: `sly,' `wily.'  |e non~, &c.: `though he 
(Cacus) did not feel ten of them,' because he was dead first. 
Virgil on the other hand makes Hercules strangle Cacus.  |le 
diece~: sub. ^percosse.~ 

	|34.  ed ei trascorse~: `he then passed by.'  The use of 
^ed~ here and in l. 50 below (cp. also Purg. viii. 97), which at
first sight seems pleonastic, is explained by Diez (^Gram.~ iii.
p. 317), who gives numerous examples of ^et, ed, e~ used in this
manner in Ital. and Old French.  He says that it has the force of
`then,' and is used with the latter of two clauses which have 
different subjects, and that it serves to make the latter of the
two subjects the more prominent.  The use of ^e~ in the sense of
`yet' seems to be an extension of this; see note on Inf. xix. 3. 

	|35.  tre spiriti~: these are three Florentine thieves, 
Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso degli Abati, and Puccio Sciancato. 
Their names are mentioned below in ll. 68, 140, and 148.  |sotto
noi~: Dante and Virgil were on the side of the embankment below 
the bridge; Inf. xxiv. 79-80. 

	|38.  novella~: `discourse.'  This meaning seems to be 
derived from that of `narrative,' `talk,' Inf. xviii. 57. 

	|40-42.  ma ei seguette~, &c.: `but it came to pass as by 
some accident a thing doth happen, that one had occasion to name
another.' 

	|43.  Cianfa~: one of the Donati family, who was a
housebreaker.  He was missing at this time, as the question here
implies, because he had been transformed into the serpent with 
six feet, l. 50. 

	|45.  dal mento al naso~: i.e. on my lips, enjoining 
silence.  From hearing Cianfa's name Dante recognized that the 
others were Florentines. 

	|46-48.  Se tu~, &c.: this form of apology or protest on 
Dante's part is one of his devices for drawing attention to 
something especially marvellous; cp. Inf. xxviii. 113-7.  The 
passage which follows is one of the most remarkable in the poem 
for its skill in giving reality to things which pass human 
experience, viz. loss of individuality, and interchange of 
personality. 

	|49-78.~  The change which is here described consists in 
the man and the serpent being blended into one form. 

	|50.  ed~: `then'; see note on l. 34. 

	|63.  N@e l' un n@e l' altro~: understand ^colore.~ 

	|64-66.  Come~: the simile here is intended to illustrate 
^mischiar lor colore~ in l. 62.  The indeterminate colour 
assumed by the two bodies, which had now become one, is compared
to the brown tint which steals over a piece of white paper, as it
burns, before it turns black.  `As there spreads over (|suso 
per~) the paper in front of the flame a brown hue, which is not 
yet black, though the white tint is disappearing.'  |papiro~: 
`paper.'  Paper made of cotton was in use in Dante's time. 

	|73.  Fersi~, &c.: `from being four strips (of flesh) the 
arms became two.' 

	|77.  Due e nessun~, &c.: `the unnatural figure appeared 
both, yet neither of the two,' i.e. the likeness both of the 
man and of the serpent was there, yet it was not the real 
likeness of either of them.  Dante here had in his mind Ovid's 
description of the formation of Hermaphroditus, where it is said
(^Met.~ iv. 378, 379), `Nec duo sunt et forma duplex, nec femina
dici Nec puer ut possint; neutrumque et utrumque videntur': see 
Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 213. 

	|79.  Come~, &c.: Dante now proceeds to describe the third
effect of a serpent's bite viz. that the man changes into a
serpent's shape the serpent into that of a man.  |fersa~: `heat';
it is probably another form of ^ferza~ `lash,' which also bears 
this sense; thus Villani (viii. 72) uses `alla ferza del sole' 
for `in the heat of the sun.' 

	|83.  un serpentello~: from the reference in l. 151 to the
person concealed. in this form we learn that he was Francesco 
Guercio de' Cavalcanti.  |acceso~: `infuriated.' 

	|85-86.  quella parte~: the navel.  |un di lor~: Buoso 
degli Abati. 

	|94-95.  l@a~, &c.: in ^Phars.~ ix. 761 foll.  Sabellus 
and Nassidius were two soldiers of Cato's army, who were bitten 
by serpents in Libya.  The body of Sabellus putrefied from the 
bite of one kind of serpent (ix. 763-82), while Nassidius died 
from the swelling of his body giving to the bite of another (ix.
790-7). 

	|96.  or si scocca~: `is about to be revealed'; |si scocca~,
lit. `is let fly.' 

	|97.  Ovidio~: the change of Cadmus into a snake is
described in Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 563 foll., that of Arethusa into a 
fountain in v. 572 foll. 

	|98-102.~  Dante maintains that his description is more 
wonderful than those of Ovid, because Ovid only narrated the 
change of a human being into something else, whereas he himself 
relates a double change, viz. that of a man into a serpent and 
that of a serpent into a man. 

	|101-102.  forme~: this word may here be rendered by
`persons,' |materia~ by `substance.'  In the language of the 
Schoolmen ^forma~ is the essential element which distinguishes a
species; hence it is used of the essence or personality of living
beings (cp. Par. iv. 54), while ^materia~ signifies the bodies in
which they reside. 

	|103-105.  Insieme~, &c.: `they corresponded one to other 
(|insieme~) in such fashion'; what is intended is that they made
a mutual change.  |ristrinse~, &c.: `drew his feet together into
one.' 

	|106-107.~  Le |gambe~, &c.: `the legs (of the man), thighs
and all, of themselves adhered so to each other.'  |seco stesse~:
`of themselves,' i.e. simply from contact.  The description here
is taken from Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 578, 579, of Cadmus, `commissaque in
unum Paulatim tereti sinuantur acumine crura.' 

	|109-111.  Togliea~, &c.: `the forked tail (of the serpent)
assumed the form,' &c.  |quella di l@a dura~: the man's skin
became hard and scaly, like that of a serpent. 

	|112.  entrar~: the man's arms closed in at the armpits; 
but the use of |accorciavan~, `shortened' (l. 114), implies that
they did not disappear altogether, but that sufficient length was
left to form the serpent's fore-legs. 

	|115-117.  li pi@e~: i.e. those of the serpent.  |n' avea 
due porti~: `had put forth two such (feet),' thus forming the 
feet of the serpent.  |porti~ from ^porgere.~ 

	|118.  il fummo~, &c.: the smoke gives the man the colour 
of a serpent, and the serpent that of a man. 

	|119-120.  genera~, &c.: `causes the hair to grow on the 
surface (|suso~) on the one figure (the serpent become a man), 
and removes it from the other (the man become a serpent).' 

	|122-123.  Non torcendo per@o~, &c.: `yet not for all that
withdrawing from one another their malign eyes.'  From l. 91 
it is seen that they were looking fixedly at one another. 
|muso~: `muzzle,' i.e. the lower part of the face. 

	|124-134.~  The next six lines describe the transformation 
of the serpent's face into that of the man; the five that follow
describe the converse change. 

	|124-126.  Quel che~, &c.: `the one that was upright drew 
it (sc. ^muso~, the snake's projecting face) in the direction of
the temples.'  The fore part of the snake's face had to be drawn 
inwards and upwards, in order to form that of the man. 
|scempie~: `flat,' lit. `simple.' 

	|127-128.  Ci@o che~, &c.: `the matter which did not run 
backward but stayed, formed with that superfluity a nose for the
face.' 

	|133.~  This and the following line, together with l. 137,
are from Ovid, ^Met.~ iv. 585-8, of Cadmus, `lingua repente 
In partes est fissa duas, nec verba volenti Sufficiunt; 
quotiesque aliquos parat edere questus, Sibilat.' 

	|134-135.  la forcuta~, &c.: `the forked tongue of the 
other (the snake) closes up.'  |il fummo resta~: the smoke, which
had marked the commencement of the transformation (ll. 92, 93), 
ceases when it is completed.  For |resta~ cp. Purg. xxix. 19. 

	|138.  parlando sputa~: `sputters as he speaks.'  This 
describes the process of imperfect speech, before the habit is 
formed. 

	|139-140.  Poscia~, &c.: `afterwards he (the serpent in 
human form) turned on him (Buoso in his serpent form) his newly 
assumed back. and said to the other (Puccio), `I desire that 
Buoso should run,' &c. 

	|142.  zavorra~: `vile gang,' Lat. ^saburra~ `ballast'; 
from this meaning it gets the sense of `rubbish' `refuse' and so
`a worthless company.'  In Modern Greek at the present day 
%sigma%alpha%beta%omicron%upsilon%rho%alpha\, which is also
derived from Lat. ^saburra~, is used as a term of contempt for `a
good-for-nothing person.'  The change from initial ^s~ into ^z~,
which is found in ^zavorra~ from ^saburra~, appears also in
^zolfo~ from ^sulphur.~  |La settima zavorra~ means the occupants
of the seventh ^bolgia.~ 

	|144.  se fior la penna abborra~: `if my pen (style of 
writing) is somewhat at fault.'  For the origin of the adverbial
use of |fior~ in the sense of `slightly,' `a little,' see note on
Inf. xxxiv. 26.  |abborra~: Lat. ^aberrat~, `wanders,' `bungles';
cp. Inf. xxxi. 24. 

	|146-147.  smagato~: `bewildered'; see note on Purg. x. 106. 
|chiusi~: `secretly,' lit. `hidden.' 

	|151.~  L' |altro~: the ^serpentello~ of l. 83.  Guercio 
was killed by some people of Gaville in the upper Valdarno, and 
in consequence of this his relations slew many of the inhabitants
of that place.
