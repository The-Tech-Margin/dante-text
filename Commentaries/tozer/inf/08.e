	|1.  seguitando~: `in continuation,' i.e. continuing the
subject of the previous Canto.  Perhaps this remark is introduced
because the subject of the fifth Circle is treated of at the end
of one Canto and the beginning of another, and the Poet wishes to
mark the connexion of the two parts.  It seems to have given rise
to the story which is mentioned by Boccaccio and others, to the
effect that Dante resumed the poem at this point after a long
interval of time.  Satisfactory arguments in confutation of this
story are given by Blanc, ^Versuch~, pp. 81, 82. 

	|4-6.  due fiammette~: the tower is the signalling station
for the city of Dis, and the two cressets are signals addressed
to the watchers in that city, the number two probably denoting
the number of the passengers approaching.  The signal in reply is
sent from the city, and signifies that the intimation has been
understood.  |i'~: for ^ivi~, Lat. ^ibi~; cp. |u'~ for Lat. ^ubi~
in Inf. vii. 120.  |cenno~: such fortress-signals (^cenni di
castella~) are referred to again in Inf. xxii. 8.  |Tanto~: take
with |da lungi.~  |torre~: `catch.' 

	|11.  Gi@a puoi scorger: puoi~, which elsewhere is always 
a monosyllable in scansion, except at the end of a line, is here
pronounced as a disyllable, |puo{vertical line}i.~  The 
justification of this exceptional use is found in the initial 
^sc~ of ^scorger~, which, like other combinations of ^s~ with 
another consonant, is sometimes allowed to have this influence on
the preceding word.  The following are instances: -- with ^sc~, 
Inf. iii. 11, ^Vid' i / o scritte~; viii. 93, ^ha / i scorta~;
xxviii. 12, ^Livi / o scrive~; with ^s~ Par. xxxi. 53, ^mi / o
sguardo; -- ~with ^sp~, Par. xxiv. 56, ^perch' i / o spandessi~;
with ^st~ Purg. xx. 139, ^no / i stavamo~; Purg. xxix. 145, ^col
primai / o stuolo (-aio~ elsewhere is a monosyllable); Par. xxvi.
37, ^intelletto mi / o sterne.~  A similar effect of these
combinations is seen in the prefixing of a vowel, as in
^iscegliendo~ for ^scegliendo~, Purg. xxviii. 41; the retention
of a vowel, as in ^Ispagna~, which is the form when a consonant
precedes, while ^Spagna~ is used when a vowel precedes; and the
regular use of ^dello strale~, ^quello strazio~, &c.  |quello che
s' aspetta~: `the object which is expected' as the result of the
signalling. 

	|16-18.  in quella~: understand ^ora.~  |anima fella~: the 
sing. is probably used because he addressed Dante and Virgil 
individually. 

	|19.  Flegi@as~: Phlegyas is the Guardian of the fifth 
Circle, as is implied in l. 21, where Virgil says that they would
not be under his charge except while crossing the marsh, thereby
intimating that others were so.  At the same time, he is the 
guardian of the approach to the city of Dis, a function which is
assigned to him because Virgil mentions him in ^Aen.~ vi. 618-20
as the type of those who had violated the laws of justice, in 
consequence of which he uttered the warning, `Discite iustitiam 
moniti et non temnere divos'; he is thus a suitable figure to 
guard the approach to the lower part of Hell, because there 
injustice in all its forms is punished (see the note in Butler's
^Translation~, p. 90).  According to the classical story Phlegyas
was condemned to punishment in Hell because he set fire to the 
Temple of Apollo at Delphi.  His boat, which is not mentioned in
any of the ancient legends concerning him, must be an invention 
of Dante's own, and was probably suggested by the need of some 
agency by which the Poets might be transported across the Stygian
marsh.  The occasions for its use must have been of very rare 
occurrence, for the condemned souls are spoken of as being 
dispatched by Minos straight to their appointed place of torment
(^gi@u volte~, Inf. v. 15; cp. ^cade~, xiii. 97; ^caduto~, 
xxvii. 26; ^piovvi~, xxiv. 122 and xxx. 95).  Virgil, however, 
passed this way, when sent by force of witchcraft from the first
Circle to the pit of Hell (ix. 25-27). 

	|21.  loto~: the muddy water of the marsh. 

	|23-24.  se ne rammarca~: `is indignant thereat'; |rammarca~
for ^rammarica.~  |ira accolta~: `concentrated fury.' 

	|28-30.  fui~: the verb here agrees with the latter of two
subjects; cp. Par. i. 27; xvi. 40.  |Dell' acqua pi@u~, &c.: cp.
Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 413, `gemuit sub pondere cymba,' &c.  |altrui~:
either Phlegyas himself may be meant, or any other spirit, like
Virgil on the former occasion, who had followed this route. 

	|31-33.  corravam~: for ^correvam~, `we were traversing'; 
the form |corravam~, like ^salavam~ in Purg. iv. 31, is a 
peculiarity of the Florentine dialect.  |morta gora~: `deathly 
channel'; |morta~ perhaps refers to the deadly stillness of its 
surface.  |anzi ora~: `before thy time,' i.e. while still alive. 

	|36.  Vedi~, &c.: this is intended as an evasive reply, 
his object being to avoid recognition. 

	|38-39.  Spirito maledetto.~  Filippo Argenti, who is here
introduced (cp. l. 61), was one of the Adimari family at
Florence, who were among Dante's strongest opponents.  Boccaccio
in the ^Decam.~ (ix. 8) tells a story which illustrates his 
passionate disposition.  |ancor~: for ^ancorch@e.~ 

	|45.  Benedetta~, &c.: `Blessed is the womb that bare thee,'
Luke xi. 27; lit. `she who became pregnant with thee.' 

	|47-48.  Bont@a non @e~, &c.: `there is no kindliness to 
adorn his memory.'  |cosi~: `in like manner'; what he was in the 
world, he is here. 

	|49.  si tengon~: `are reputed.' 

	|59.  alle~: for the use of ^a~ after ^fare~ signifying 
`by' cp. Inf. xvii. 129; xxi. 55. 

	|64-66.  ch@e~: `so that.' |sbarro~: `unbar,' `open wide.' 

	|68.  la citt@a~, &c.  The idea of the city of Dis -- or, 
as it is here called, the city named Dis -- with its walls of 
iron, and a river encircling them, is taken from the description
of the abode of the malefactors in Hell in Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 548
foll.  The city of Dis comprises the whole of the remainder of 
Hell, for Dis is another name for Lucifer (cp. Inf. xi. 65;
xxxiv. 20), and he is placed at the lowest extremity of that 
realm. 

	|70.  meschite~: `mosques'; the word is intended to suggest
the city of unbelief. 

	|75.  in questo basso inferno~: this is added to explain 
that they stood out visible in the darkness of the nether hell. 

	|76-78.  pur~: `nevertheless,' i.e. despite the terrific
sight.  |terra~: `city,' see note to l. 130.  |fosse~: obs. the 
grammatical irregularity of the verb agreeing in number with the
predicate, and cp. Purg. x. 112, 113, `quel ch' io veggio...non 
mi sembran persone.' 

	|79.  far grande aggirata~: this took place in following 
the windings of the fosse, which formed a succession of moats 
(^fosse~, l. 76), which were intended to render the approach more
difficult. 

	|82-83.  in sulle porte~: probably this means `on the 
threshold of the gates.'  Many take it as `upon the gates,' but 
from l. 115 it appears that the gates were open.  |Da' ciel 
piovuti~: these are the fallen angels. 

	|93.  Che gli hai scorta~: `who hast made plain to him.' 
The very exceptional scansion of |hai~ as a disyllable here is 
explained by ^sc~ following; see notes on l. 11 above, and on 
Inf. xv. 26. 

	|97-99.  pi@u di sette~: probably a general number, though 
it is possible to enumerate seven such occasions, as Philalethes
has done.  |alto periglio~: `extremity of danger'; |alto~ gives a
superlative force; see note on Inf. ii. 12. 

	|105.  da tal~: by God; but the Holy Name is not mentioned
in Hell. 

	|110-111.  in forse~: `in doubt'; cp. Purg. xxix. 18, `mi
mise in forse.' |Che 'l s@i e 'l no~, &c.: `so that yes and no
(the conviction that he will return, and that he will not return)
contend within my brain.'  Others read |Ch@e.~ 

	|112-114.  si porse~: `was addressed' by Virgil.  |a prova~:
`vied with one another in': `pell-mell rushed back within,' Cary,
who gives ^certatim, @a l'envi~ as equivalents. 

	|117.  rivolsesi a me~: the repulse of Virgil, followed 
by the arrival of an angel from heaven who secures Dante's 
admittance to the city of Dis, is probably intended to teach, 
allegorically, that at the greatest crises of our moral life our
ordinary means of support fail us, and a special intervention of
spiritual aid on our behalf is necessary.  Another explanation 
is, that the sixth Circle, which lies immediately within the 
walls of the city of Dis, is that in which heresy is punished, 
and in order to enter it the aid of a heavenly champion is 
required, since the question of religious belief is involved, and
with this human reason (Virgil) is incapable of dealing.  This 
view, however, is hardly satisfactory, for the question here is 
that of admittance, not to the sixth Circle in particular, but to
the city of Dis at large. 

	|118-120.  le ciglia~, &c.: this describes one who is 
`crestfallen.'  |dicea ne' sospiri~: `sighed as if he said,' lit.
`said in his sighs'; cp. ^aspettava in vista~, `wore an expectant
look,' Purg. xiii. 100.  |le dolenti case~: `the abodes of woe,'
i.e. the lower Circles of the Inferno. 

	|121-123.  perch' io m' adiri~: `for all my anger'; cp. Inf.
iv. 64.  |Qual che~, &c.: `whatever force may muster within to
repel me'; |difension~, lit. `warding off'; cp. ^difese~ in Inf.
xv. 27. 

	|125.  men segreta porta~: the gate of Hell itself, where,
according to an ancient tradition, the devils opposed the
entrance of Christ when He descended into Hell, but He broke the
gate open.  Cp. the Church Office for Easter Eve, Lect. iv, 
`Hodie portas mortis et seras pariter Salvator noster disrupit.' 

	|127.  Sopr' essa~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `the gate I 
speak of is that over which thou sawest the deathly inscription'
(`characters of death,' Vernon); cp. Inf. iii. 1.  |vedestu~ for
^vedesti tu.~ 

	|128-130.  E gi@a~, &c.: `and already on the hither side of
the gate one (an angel from heaven; see Inf. ix. 85) is
descending the steep,...of such might that (|Tal ch~e) by his 
aid the city shall be opened to us.'  Virgil says this in the 
confidence of faith: that he did not ^know~ it is shown by his 
subsequent attitude; see Inf. ix. 7-12.  |senza scorta~: i.e. 
defended by his own purity, and guided by his own intuition. 
|terra~: for the use of this word in the sense of `city, cp. Inf.
ix. 104; x. 2; and l. 77 above.  This meaning, which is found in
Boccaccio and other writers, seems to have arisen from ^terra~ 
being used at first of a city and its territory in conjunction, 
without any marked distinction being made between them.
