	|1-3.  Malebolge~: `Evil-pits.'  The word ^bolgia~ (Lat.
^bulga~) means `a wallet' and so `a hollow place.'  For a
description of Malebolge see the Argument.  |la cerchia~: `the 
encircling rock,' i.e. the precipice by the side of which they 
have descended.  |che d' intorno il volge~: `which runs round 
it,' lit. `which turns it around.' 

	|4-6.  dritto mezzo~: `the very middle.'  |campo~: `area.' 
|Vaneggia~: `opens wide,' `yawns,' lit. `forms a void (^vano~).' 
|pozzo~: the pit of Hell.  |suo loco~: this Latin phrase is 
probably borrowed from scholastic Latin.  |ordigno~: `structure.'

	|7. adunque~ = ^dunque~, `then.'  The meaning is
inferential, marking the result of the position of Malebolge. 

	|10-12.  Quale~, &c.: |Quale~ agrees with |figura~, which 
is the predicate to |rende.  |La parte dov' ei son~ means `the 
ground which they occupy,' and |Quale figura la parte dov' ei son
rende~ signifies `such as is their ground-plan.'  The concentric
valleys of Malebolge are compared to the moats which, one within
the other, run round a fortress. 

	|13-14.  quelli~: understand ^fossi.~  |sogli~: `thresholds
of the gates.' 

	|16-18.  Cosi~, &c.: `so from the foot of the precipice 
started (|movien~) bridges of rock, which intersected the 
embankments and the ravines, until they reached the pit, where 
they end and meet.'  There were bridges at intervals, which may
be said to meet at the circle of the inner pit, in the same way
as the spokes of a wheel meet at the nave.  |scogli~: observe
that throughout the account of Malebolge the word ^scoglio~ is
used for `a bridge of rock'; e.g. ^infra~, l. 111; xix. 8. 
|raccogli~: for ^raccoglieli~; cp. ^accolo~ for ^accoglilo~ in 
Purg. xiv. 6. 

	|22-23.  nuova pieta~: `a strange form of woe.'
|frustatori~: `wielders of the lash' (Longf.): in Lev. xix. 20 
(Vulg.) scourging is the penalty of seduction. 

	|25.  ignudi~: this does not imply that the sinners in other
parts of Hell were clothed, but draws attention to the condition
of the present class, which exposed them defenceless to their
punishment.

	|26-27.  Dal mezzo in qua~: `on the nearer side of the
valley.'  The sinners formed two lines, one on either side, and
moved in opposite directions; those on the nearer side advancing
towards the Poets, those on the farther side following the same
direction as they were taking (|con noi~), only at greater speed
(|con passi maggiori~), because they were driven by the demons. 
The former of these were the procurers, the latter the seducers. 
Dante and Virgil were walking leftwards (l. 21) along the ridge
which bounded the dike or valley on the outer side. 

	|28-30.  Come i Roman~: the simile is derived from what 
took place at the Ponte Sant' Angelo at Rome during the Jubilee 
of 1300.  The rule of right and left for pedestrians on bridges
is not unknown at the present day, for instance at Dresden, where
it is enforced by the police.  |esercito~: `host of worshippers.'
|Manno~, &c.: `devised a plan to let the people pass.'  ^Passare~
is used trans. elsewhere in Italian, e.g. for `to put a person
across a river,' &c.; see ^Vocab. Tramater.~ 

	|32-33.  il castello~: the Castle of St. Angelo, as the 
Mausoleum of Hadrian was then and is still called.  This faces 
one who crosses to the right bank of the Tiber.  |il monte~: the
Capitoline Hill, which is the most important point to attract 
passengers in that direction, as St. Peter's is in the other. 

	|35.  cornuti~: wearing horns, the emblem of adultery. 

	|37.  levar le berze~: `quicken their steps,' lit. `lift 
their shanks.' 

	|42.  digiuno~: here used, as in Inf. xxviii. 87 and Par. 
ii. 75, in the sense of `lacking'; `I have not failed erewhile to
see this one': `with sight of this one I am not unfed' (Longf.). 

	|43-45.  a figurarlo~: `to scrutinize his looks.' 
|indietro~: the person spoken of, being a procurer, had come from
the opposite direction and was passing them; see note on ll. 26,
27.  Dante retraces his steps in order to look at him. 

	|49-51.  le fazion che porti~: `the features that thou 
wearest.'  |Venedico~: this person was head of the Guelf party in
Bologna in the latter half of the thirteenth century.  |pungenti
Salse~: `pungent brine,' i.e. acute pain.  As the sinner whom 
Dante addresses was from Bologna, there is a reference here to a
valley called Salse in the neighbourhood of that city, where the
bodies of criminals were thrown. 

	|53.  chiara favella~: `accurate address'; it was Dante's 
precise mention of him which recalled his former life and 
inclined him to reply. 

	|55-57.  Ghisolabella~: she was sister of Caccianimico, and
was persuaded by him to become the mistress of the Marquis of 
Este.  The reading ^Ghisola bella~, which the old commentators 
give, is now proved to be incorrect, for her will, which has 
lately been found, gives her name as Ghislabella; see Toynbee, 
^Dict.~, p. 271.  |Come che~, &c.: `in whatever form the 
scandalous story may be told.'  This implies that Dante thought 
there was more than one version of the affair, and Benvenuto 
speaks to the same effect. 

	|60-61.  Che tante~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `there are 
more natives of Bologna here than there are at present in the 
world above.'  |apprese~: `taught.'  |sipa~: Bolognese for ^sia.~
Benvenuto, who resided in Bologna, asserts this; and Casini adds
that the modern Bolognese say ^sepa~ for ^sia.~  Hence |a dicer 
sipa~ means `to use the Bolognese dialect.'  |Savena e Reno~: the
two rivers which flow down from the Apennines on either side of 
Bologna. 

	|63.  Recati a mente~, &c.: i.e. `you will find the proof of
it in the avarice of our hearts.'  Benvenuto confirms the charge
of covetousness. 

	|66.  da conio~: `for hire.' 

	|68-69.  divenimmo~ L@a: `we arrived at the point'; cp. Inf.
xiv. 76. 

	|71-72.  a destra~: as the Poets had followed the embankment
^a sinistra~ (l. 21), to cross the bridge they turn ^a destra.~ 
|scheggia~: the `craggy mass' of the rock which formed the
bridge.  |cerchie~: `encircling walls.'  The precipices
surrounding Malebolge are meant, which are called `la gran
cerchia' in Inf. xxiii. 134.  The epithet |eterne~, as applied to
these `walls,' probably signifies that they were a place of 
everlasting imprisonment. 

	|73-74.  dov' ei vaneggia Di sotto: ei~ is the bridge 
(^scoglio~, l. 69); `where it opens wide below'; i.e. the bridge
of rock forms an arch, so that the souls may pass through.  For 
|vaneggia~ see note on l. 5. 

	|75-76.  che feggia Lo viso in te~: lit. `that the sight 
may strike on thee'; |feggia~ from ^ferire~, cp. Inf xv. 39. 
|mal nati~: `born in an evil hour'; cp. Inf. v. 7.  The persons 
here spoken of are the seducers. 

	|78.  con noi insieme~: see note on l. 26. 

	|79-80.  guardavam la traccia~: `we were watching the file.' 
The Poets are looking down over the right-hand side of the
bridge, towards which the sinners are approaching.  |dall' altra
banda~: `on the other side' of the valley; cp. Purg. xiii. 79. 

	|84.  per dolor~: `for all his pain'; cp. Inf. xvi. 93, ^per
parlar~; xxi. 28, ^per veder.~  |non par...spanda~: ^che~ is
understood after |par~, as it often is in modern Italian.  Jason,
like Capaneus (Inf. xiv. 46-8), refuses to show outward signs of
pain. 

	|86-87.  core~: `courage.'  |monton~: i.e. the Golden
Fleece.  |fene~: a Tuscan form, for ^f@e~; cp. ^puone~, Inf. xi.
31. 

	|89.  Poi che~, &c.: when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos, 
they found it inhabited only by women, who had murdered by 
agreement all the males in the island. 

	|91.  segni~: `love-tokens.'  There is much to be said in 
favour of the reading ^senno~ here; see Moore ^Text. Crit.~, p.
321.  |parole ornate~: `skilful speech'; cp. Inf. ii. 67. 

	|92-93.  Isifile~: Hypsipyle, whom Jason seduced and then
deserted.  Dante has taken the story in the main from Statius,
^Theb.~ v. 403 foll.  |Che prima~, &c.: she saved from death her
father Thoas, contrary to her agreement with the other women. 

	|96.  di Medea~: Jason first won her love, and then deserted
and wronged her, after she had accompanied him to Greece. 

	|97-99.  da tal parte~: `after this fashion.' |in s@e 
assanna~: `holds in its grip.' 

	|100-102.  lo stretto calle~: the path which leads across 
Malebolge crosses one ^bolgia~ after another by means of the 
bridges, and cuts at right angles the embankments which intervene
between them.  At the point now reached it intersects
(|incrocicchia~) the embankment between the first and second 
^bolge~, and starts from the farther side of that to form the 
bridge across the second ^bolgia.~  |fa di quello~, &c.: lit. 
`makes it a buttress to another arch.' 

	|103-104.  Quindi~, &c.: in the second ^bolgia~, which 
Dante here overlooks, the flatterers suffer an offensive 
punishment, suitable to their contemptible sin.  |si nicchia~: 
`whines.'  |isbuffa~: `snorts.' 

	|108.  facea zuffa~: `made war upon,' `was offensive to.' 

	|117.  non parea~, &c.: i.e. it could not be seen whether he
had a tonsure or not. 

	|121-122.  asciutti~: in their natural state, without their
covering of filth.  |Alessio Interminei~: nothing is known of
this man except that he was a flatterer, and that he was alive 
in 1295, as appears from a document dated in that year; see 
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 24. 

	|124.  zucca~: `pate'; lit. `gourd.' 

	|130-132.  scapigliata fante~: `wench with dishevelled
hair.'  |s' accoscia~: `sits crouching'; cp. ^mi raccoscio~ in
Inf. xvii. 123. 

	|133.  Taide~: Thais, the courtesan in the ^Eunuchus~ of 
Terence.  The passage in that play which is here referred to is 
^Eunuch.~ iii. 1. 1, where Thraso (the soldier) says `Magnas vero
agere gratias Thais mihi?' and Gnatho (the parasite) replies 
`Ingentes.'  It will be seen that Dante has made the mistake of 
putting Gnatho's reply into the mouth of Thais.  The origin of 
this error is to be found in his not having taken the words 
direct from Terence, but from Cicero, who quotes the passage in 
^De Amicit.~ xxvi. {part} 98; `"Magnas vero agere gratias Thais
mihi?" Satis erat respondere, "Magnas": "Ingentes" inquit. 
Semper auget assentator id, quod is, cuius ad voluntatem dicitur,
vult esse magnum.'  This explanation is strongly corroborated by
the fact that Cicero introduces this as an instance of flattery;
and since it is not definitely stated there by whom the word
`Ingentes' is spoken, it was easy for Dante to suppose that it
was uttered by Thais herself.  It may be added that Dante does
not elsewhere give any evidence of being acquainted with Terence. 
See Moore, ^Studies~, i. pp. 261, 262. 

	|136.  quinci~: `herewith.'  This line suggests Dante's
reason for giving such a brief account of this ^bolgia~, viz. the
contemptible character of its occupants.
