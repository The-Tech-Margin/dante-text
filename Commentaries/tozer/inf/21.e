	|2.  commed@ia~: see note on Inf. xvi. 128. 

	|7.  Arzan@a~: the Arsenal of Venice is situated towards the
eastern extremity of that city. 

	|10.  in quella vece~: `instead thereof,' i.e. of voyaging;
cp. Purg. xvi. 36. 

	|14.  volge sarte~: `twists cordage.' 

	|17.  pegola~: in accordance with the saying, `Those who 
handle pitch shall be defiled therewith,' the pitch here 
symbolizes the dirty work of jobbery, and the money that sticks 
to the jobber's fingers. 

	|20.  Ma' che~: `aught else than,' Lat. ^magis quam.~ 

	|25.  cui tarda~: `who is impatient,' lit. `to whom it seems
long',; cp. Inf. ix. 9.  The person here described is influenced
at once by curiosity and fear. 

	|28.  per veder~: `for all his looking'; cp. Inf. xvi. 93,
^per parlar.~ 

	|30.  lo scoglio~: the bridge of rock. 

	|32.  nell' atto acerbo~: `cruel in his aspect.' 

	|34-36.  acuto e superbo~: `pointed and high.'  |carcava~: 
`encumbered'; the guilty soul was carried on the shoulders of the
devil, who held him fast at the ankles by the tendons. 

	|37.  Del nostro ponte disse~: `from our bridge he
exclaimed.'  Some editors make |Del nostro ponte~ part of the 
speech; in this case the meaning is, `O ye Malebranche who guard
our bridge,' it being implied that there was a band of them at 
each of the bridges which spanned at intervals this ^bolgia.~ 
|Malebranche~: this is a collective name for these demons; cp. 
Inf. xxxiii. 142: for this reason ^Mettete~ (l. 39) is plural. 

	|38.  anzian di santa Zita~: Elders of Lucca: the city is 
here called by the name of the local saint who was its patron. 
`Elders' was the title of its chief magistrates, as `Priors' 
was for those of Florence. 

	|39-40.  per anche~: `once more.' |ch' i' n' ho~, &c.: 
`which I have well provided with such characters.' 

	|41.  fuor che Bonturo~: ironical, Bonturo having been 
notorious for jobbery. 

	|42.  ita~: `yes'; this is the Latin word, which is used in
that language in this sense.  As regards the meaning of the line,
Lana says that, when votes were taken in the public council at
Lucca, two ballot-boxes were carried round, one for the Ayes, the
other for the Noes; and that sometimes, when the interest of the
state required that they should vote `No,' they voted `Aye' for a
bribe. 

	|44-45.  mai non fu~, &c.: `never was mastiff, when its 
leash was slipped, in such a hurry,' &c. 

	|46-48.  convolto:~ ` doubled up,' i.e. arching his back
above the surface for the sake of relief, while he concealed the
rest of his person.  This action on his part is illustrated by 
the comparison of the porpoises in Inf. xxii. 19-24.  |avean 
coperchio~: they were lying in wait under the arch.  |Qui non~, 
&c.: `It's no use invoking the Holy Face here.'  The `Holy Face'
of Lucca was an ancient crucifix, and the Lucchesi used to invoke
it in time of need. 

	|49.  Serchio~: the river which flows near Lucca; formerly
it joined the Arno below Pisa, now it enters the sea by a
separate channel.  Its stream was a favourite bathing-resort of 
the people of Lucca. 

	|52-54.  addentar~: `pronged.'  |accaffi~: `pilfer.' 

	|57.  galli~: used, like the modern ^galleggiare~, for `to
float.' 

	|60.  che alcun~, &c.: `that you may have some screen for 
yourself'; |haia~ for ^abbia~, as in Par. xvii. 140. 

	|62-63.  ch' io ho~, &c.: `for I am conversant with the 
matter'; for |conte~ cp. Inf. iii. 76.  |altra volta~: the
occasion referred to is that mentioned in Inf. ix. 22-7, where 
Virgil says that he was forced by the enchantress Erichtho to 
bring up a lost soul from the pit of Hell.  |baratta~:
`bargaining,' i.e. negotiations with the demons. 

	|64-65.  co~: for ^capo~; cp. Inf. xx. 76.  |la ripa sesta~:
the embankment which separates the fifth from the sixth 
^bolgia.~ 

	|69.  chiede ove s' arresta~: `begs at the place where he
stops.' 

	|76.  Malacoda~: the leader of the devils in this ^bolgia~;
in l. 115 he speaks of the others as ^questi miei.~ 

	|78.  dicendo: `Che gli approda?~': saying (to himself),
what good will it do him?' lit. `what does it benefit him?' 
Virgil's next remark is an answer to this.  |approda~: der. from
^pro, prode~, `advantage.' 

	|81.  schermi~: `hindrances,' lit. `means of defence.' 

	|84.  silvestro~: `wild'; cp. Inf. ii. 142. 

	|89.  quatto~: `crouching,' from Lat. ^coactus~; Diez,
^W,ort.~, p. 260.  It is the same word as Engl. `squat,' which 
was originally `quat'; Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `squat.' 

	|93.  temetti~: for ^temei~; cp. Inf. xxxi. 109.  |ch' ei 
tenesser.~: `that they would not keep'; the construction
corresponds to that of the Lat. ^vereor ut~, while ^temer no~ or
^che non~ means `to fear that,' Lat. ^vereor ne~; cp. Inf. ii.
35, 64; iii. 80.  Others read ^temetti non tenesser~ here, but
the MS. authority is strongly in favour of |ch' ei tenesser~ 
(see Moore, ^Text. Grit.~, p. 330), and ^non~ arose from a 
misunderstanding of the idiom. 

	|94-96.~  E cosi, &c.: what is here referred to is the 
evacuation of Caprona, a fort in the Pisan territory, by the 
Pisans in 1289, when it was captured by the people of Lucca and 
the Florentines.  The words |vid' io~ imply that Dante was
present on the occasion. 

	|102.  fa che gliele accocchi~: `mind you poke at him.'  The
phrase here used is ^accoccarla ad uno~, which means `to play a
person a trick'; and |gliele~ -- which is an indeclinable form, 
standing for ^glielo, gliela, glieli~ (cp. Inf. xxxiii. 149) -- 
here represents ^gliela.~ For the use of ^la~ in such phrases see
note on Inf. xv. 99. 

	|106-107.  per questo iscoglio~: `along this rocky ridge.' 
|Iscoglio~ here, as in Inf. xviii. 16, is the transverse ridge
which forms a line of bridges across Malebolge.  The Poets were
now on the embankment which separates the fifth from the sixth
^bolgia~ (l. 65), and Malacoda tells them that they cannot
continue their course along the transverse ridge, because the 
next bridge was broken; so he recommends them to follow the 
embankment till they reached the next transverse ridge, saying 
that they could cross by the bridge there, which was unbroken 
(^tutto intero~, l. 126).  In this last statement he was 
deceiving them, as they discover later (Inf. xxiii. 136 foll.), 
for there also the bridge was broken. 

	|110.  grotta~: `rock,' i.e. the embankment. 

	|112-114.  Ier~, &c.: `yesterday, five hours before the 
present time, completed 1266 years from the time when the way 
was broken.'  |Ier~ is the subject to |compi@e.~  |pi@u
oltre...che~ signifies `before.'  |otta~ means the same as ^ora~,
just as ^allotta~ means the same as ^allora~; its etymology is
uncertain, but it is not connected with ^ora.~  This passage is
of especial importance among the Time-References in the ^Div.
Com.~, because it serves as a starting-point, from which other
computations of time in the poem may be made.  The following is
the explanation of it.  Malacoda, in order to inspire Virgil with
greater confidence in his statement, gives the exact date,
computed from the moment at which he is speaking, of the
destruction of the bridges, which took place at the time of our
Lord's death, when the rocks were rent.  This, he says, was 1266
years and a day (it was |ier~), all but five hours, before the
present time.  Now as Dante believed that Christ died in the
thirty-fourth year of His age (^Conv.~ iv. 23, ll. 95-8; `il
nostro Salvatore Cristo, il quale volle morire nel
trentaquattresimo anno della sua etade'), the year here meant
must be 1300 A.D. (1266 + 34).  The day of the Church's year,
being that which followed the day of our Lord's death or Good
Friday, is Easter Eve.  And, as Dante held that Christ died at
mid-day (^Conv.~ iv, 23, ll. 105-7; `onde dice Luca, che era
quasi ora sesta quando mor@io'), by deducting five hours we find
the present time of day to be 7 a.m.  To sum up, we have now
reached 7 a.m. on Easter Eve of 1300 A.D. 

	|116.  se ne sciorina~: `is airing himself'; `if any of 
those in torment in the pitch is exposing his body to the air.' 

	|120.  la decina~: the company of ten devils. 

	|124-126.  pane~: for ^panie~, plur. of ^pania~, `birdlime,'
here used for `tar.' |scheggio~: `line of rock-bridges,' like
^scoglio~ in l. 111.  |intero~: `unbroken.'  |tane~: `dens,' i.e. 
the ^bolge.~ 

	|135.  lessi~: `boiled meat,'; stews,' i.e. the sinners who
are stewing in the pitch. 

	|136.  sinistro~: the usual direction through the Inferno. 

	|137.  stretta~: `pressed the tongue with the teeth,' i.e. 
thrust the tongue between the teeth.
