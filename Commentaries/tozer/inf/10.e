	|1.  secreto calle~: `a concealed path'; cp. Virg. ^Aen.~
vi. 443, `Secreti celant calles.' 

	|2.  Tra il muro~, &c.: `between the wall of the city of 
Dis and the torments.'  The question has been much debated, why 
the heretics occupy this position immediately within the wall of
the city of Dis.  The best answer to this seems to be that, owing
to the nature of Dante's scheme of punishments, which is set 
forth in Canto XI, it was difficult to find an appropriate place
for them, and that under the circumstances this suggested itself
as the most suitable.  For Dante's classification of sins was 
based on a moral code, in accordance with which violence and 
fraud are punished within the city of Dis (Inf. xi. 22 foll.), 
and the various forms of incontinence outside it (Inf. xi. 70 
foll.); whereas heresy is a sin of the intellect and therefore 
finds no place among them.  But, as it was necessary to introduce
it somewhere, it was classed with the worse order of offences in 
the lower part of Hell, because heresy is a sin especially 
abhorrent to God; and it was placed near to the entrance of the 
city of Dis, in order that it might be kept separate from the 
sins of violence and fraud. 

	|5.  Mi volvi~: `dost lead me round.'  This passage shows 
that the Poets' course was curved or spiral, as it naturally 
would be, since the Inferno was funnel-shaped, and they descended
continually in the same (leftward) direction. 

	|11.  Josaff@at~:  `the valley of judgement.'  Jehoshaphat
means `the Lord judgeth'; and since the prophet Joel (iii. 2, 12)
speaks of the Valley of Jehoshaphat at Jerusalem as the place
where God will hold judgement, it came to be regarded as the
scene of the final judgement, and it is so still among the 
Mahometans. 

	|15.  morta fanno~: `represent as dying.'  During the 
thirteenth century the denial of the immortality of the soul was
imputed by the Papal Curia to many of the Ghibellines, such as 
Farinata (l. 32) and Cardinal Ubaldini (l. 120), who in 
consequence of this were known as `Epicureans.' 

	|18.  che tu mi taci~: Virgil elsewhere (e.g. Inf. xxiii.
25-7) describes himself as being a mirror to Dante's thoughts. 
The desire here spoken of is probably that of seeing some
Florentine heretics, since scepticism was rife at this time in
Florence. 

	|21.  non pur mo~: `not on the present occasion only.' 
|mo~ is Lat. ^modo.~  The ref. is to Inf. iii. 76-81, where 
Dante's fear of vexing Virgil by his questions is described. 

	|23.  parlando onesto~: as in Inf. ii. 113, this expression
implies `skill in speech,' but here it refers specially to the
use of refined language (the ^volgare illustre~). 

	|25.  La tua loquela~: here, as in Inf. xxxiii. 11, 12 and
Purg. xvi. 137, some peculiarity of the ^lingua Toscana~ is
meant, probably the pronunciation; hardly the dialect, which was
anything but refined. 

	|27.  troppo molesto~: Farinata, who is here speaking, was
in the middle of Cent. xiii the head of the family of the Uberti,
who were the leaders of the Ghibelline party in Florence.  The
occasion on which he was `too injurious' in his treatment of
Florence was when, after his expulsion from the city in 1258, he
retired to Siena, where he and his fellow exiles concerted the 
measures which led to the great defeat of the Florentine Guelfs 
at Montaperti. 

	|29.  arche~: `coffers'; i.e. the tombs or sarcophagi in
which the spirits were confined. 

	|35.  ergea~: syncopated form of ^erigea.~ 

	|39.  conte~: `well-considered,' since he was dealing with a
man of position and a political opponent.  ^Conto~, from meaning
`known,' `clear,' readily passes into the sense of `well thought
out.' 

	|43.  ubbidir~: to comply with Virgil's admonition. 

	|47-48.  primi~: `forefathers.'  |parte~: the Ghibellines. 
|due fiate~: in 1248 and 1260. 

	|50.  l' una e l' altra fiata~: the first time in 1251, 
after the death of Frederic II; the second in 1266, after the 
battle of Benevento. 

	|51.  vostri~: here, and in l. 63, where Cavalcante is 
addressed, ^vostro~ is used for ^tuo~ as a mark of respect to the
dignity of the person spoken to; cp. the use of the plural verb 
in ll. 110, 114.  For the other instances in the poem in which 
this occurs see note on Purg. xxxiii. 92.  |quell' arte~: the art
of returning home.  In 1280, when a reconciliation of the Guelf 
and Ghibelline parties took place at Florence, the family of the
Uberti were excepted, and were not permitted to return. 

	|52-53.  Allor~, &c.: the order of the words is -- `allora
un' ombra surse lungo questa, scoperchiata alla vista infino al
mento.'  Others take |alla vista scoperchiata~ as `at the
uncovered mouth of the tomb,' comparing Purg. x. 67, where
^vista~ means `a window.'  |Un' ombra~: this is Cavalcante de' 
Cavalcanti, father of Dante's friend the poet Guido Cavalcanti, 
who married Farinata's daughter.  Boccaccio says that Cavalcante
did not believe in a future life.  In several places in the ^Vita
Nuova~ Dante speaks of Guido as his most intimate friend, e.g.
^V. N.~ {part} 3, ll. 98, 99. 

	|56-57.  altri~: his son Guido.  |suspicar~: `questioning';
the word expresses mingled doubt and hope. 

	|63.  Forse~, &c.: the meaning of this line has not been 
clearly explained.  As the statement is qualified by |forse~, 
perhaps it signifies that contempt of Virgil might be ^inferred~
from Guido's writings.  By some it is supposed -- on the strength
of Dante's saying in the ^Vita Nuova~ ({part} 31, ll. 21-4) that
Guido desired that he should write that work throughout in 
Italian -- that he depreciated the Latin language; and that this
would cause him to neglect Virgil as being a Latin author. 

	|64-65.  Le sue~, &c.: Dante had discovered who Cavalcante
was from his implying that his son was Dante's friend, and from
his being punished as a sceptic. 

	|68-69.  "egli ebbe"~: the past tense seemed to imply that
he did so no longer.  |ancora~: `still.'  |lome~: arch. for
^lume.~ 

	|73-74.  a cui posta~: `at whose desire'; cp. Inf. xvi. 81,
^a tua posta.~  Farinata's request that Dante should stop is 
mentioned in l. 24.  |non mut@o aspetto~: Farinata's self-command
was shown by his not wincing or betraying emotion, while the fate
of his son-in-law was the topic of conversation. 

	|79.  cinquanta volte~: the period meant is four years and
two months, i.e. from April, 1300, the supposed date of the
Vision, to June, 1304.  It was about that time that the attempts
of the White Guelfs to secure their restoration to Florence 
finally failed, and that Dante separated himself from his party.
If a more exact date than this is required, it may be that of the
departure of Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato from Florence on June 4,
1304, which marked the failure of the embassy of reconciliation 
between the rival factions on which he was sent by Benedict XI. 

	|80.  della donna che qui regge~: this is Hecate, who is 
identified by Dante with Proserpine as the goddess who rules in 
Hell.  Here she represents the moon, according to the view of 
ancient mythology.  Other classical names of the moon which are 
found in the ^Div. Com.~ are ^Delia~, Purg. xxix. 78; ^Trivia~,
Par. xxiii. 26; ^la figlia di Latona~, Par. x. 67. 

	|81.  quanto...pesa~: `the difficulty of.' 

	|82.  mai~: `hereafter'; see on l. 94.  |regge~: arch. for
^reggi~, which stands for ^riedi~, 2nd pers. subj. pres. from
^riedere~, `to return'; `so may'st thou return.'  For another 
instance of |se~ with the subj. expressing a wish or prayer cp.
l. 94.  When this particle is thus used, it is derived, not, as 
might appear at first sight, from Lat. ^sic~, but from ^si~, and
has a conditional force (= `if you wish that,' &c.); see Diez, 
^Gram.~, vol. iii. pp. 328, 329. 

	|84.  a' miei~: `against my relations,' the Uberti; see 
note on l. 51. 

	|85-87.  Lo strazio~: the battle of Montaperti, which was 
fought on the banks of the Arbia, Sept. 4, 1260.  |scempio~: 
`massacre'; cp. Purg. xii. 55.  It is derived from Lat.
^exemplum~, and gets this meaning from that of `exemplary 
punishment'; K,orting, ^W,ort.~, No. 2941.  |Tale orazion~, &c.:
`causes such addresses (i.e. deliberations and decrees against
the Uberti) to be made in our temple.'  The `temple' is the 
church of San Giovanni, where popular assemblies were held.  Or 
the meaning may be, `causes such prayers to be offered up in our
church for deliverance from the machinations of the Uberti.' 

	|89-90.  A ci@o~: at the battle of Montaperti.  He sighs 
(|sospirando~) at the thought of having fought against Florence 
at all.  |Senza cagion~: his justification was his unjust 
banishment.  |mosso~: `set forth.' 

	|91-93.  fu' io sol~: take with |Colui~ below; `I and I 
only was the man.'  |col@a~: at Empoli, where the Ghibellines in 
council proposed the destruction of Florence, and Farinata 
opposed it singlehanded.  In recognition of this his statue now 
stands in front of the Ufizi among those of the heroes of 
Florence.  |a viso aperto~: `openly,' `boldly.' 

	|94-96.  Se riposi mai~, &c.: on |Se~ see note to l. 82; `so
may your descendants hereafter find repose,' i.e. may they be
restored to Florence.  |ha inviluppata~, &c.: `has entangled my
judgement.'  The difficulty (|nodo~) which puzzles Dante is that,
whereas Farinata is able to predict future events (ll. 79-81),
Cavalcante is unaware of his son's present condition (l. 60). 

	|97-99.  se ben odo~: i.e. if I understand aright what I 
have heard.  |tenete altro modo~: `take a different course,' i.e. 
are in ignorance. 

	|100-102.  mala luce~: `imperfect sight,' i.e.
longsightedness, technically called presbyopy, when near objects
are seen indistinctly, but distant ones plainly.  |lontano~: adv. 
|Cotanto~, &c.: `so much light is still vouchsafed to us by God.' 

	|104.  non ci apporta~: `does not bring us news.' 

	|107-108.  da quel punto~, &c.: after the judgement eternity
will commence, and then there will be no more future 
time.  By |conoscenza~, then, is meant the knowledge of present 
and future events, as distinguished from the memory of the past,
which would remain with them. 

	|109.  mia colpa~: his remissness, in not at once answering
Cavalcante's question.

	|113-114.  ei~: both this form and ^i~ are used for ^gli.~ 
Translate -- `inform him that I did not answer because my 
thoughts were even then occupied by the perplexing question 
(|error~) which you have solved for me.' 

	|116.  pi@u avaccio~: `with more eager haste.'  |avaccio~ 
is an obsolete adv.; cp. Inf. xxxiii. 106. 

	|119-120.  Federico~: Frederic II, to whom Dante on other
grounds awards high praise in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 12, ll. 20
foll.), was regarded by his contemporaries as a heretic.  |il
Cardinale~: Ottaviano degli Ubaldini.  The evidence of his
scepticism was, according to Benvenuto, that on one occasion he 
said, `Si anima est, ego perdidi ipsam millies pro Ghibelinis.' 

	|123.  quel parlar~: viz. Farinata's prophetic intimation in
ll. 79-81. 

	|127-132.  La mente tua~, &c.  The general meaning of this 
passage is as follows: `Store up in your mind what you have heard
to your disadvantage, but for the present occupy yourself with 
what lies before you; afterwards Beatrice will reveal to you 
your coming fortunes.'  |Drizz@o il dito~: he pointed with his 
finger to the scene before them, thus enforcing his injunction 
that Dante give his attention to the sights and warnings of Hell
(|attendi qui~). 

	|131.  quella~: Beatrice is meant, but hers is one of the 
sacred names which are not mentioned in Hell.  In reality, when 
the time arrives, she does not herself reveal Dante's fortunes to
him, but refers him to his ancestor Cacciaguida (Par. xvii. 7). 

	|133.  a man sinistra~: hitherto they had been keeping the
wall on their right hand (see Inf. ix. 132, 133); hence, in order
to cross the circle, they had to turn to the left. 

	|135.  una valle~: the seventh Circle.  |fiede~: `strikes,'
`leads.'
