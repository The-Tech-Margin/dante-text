	|1-3. con parole sciolte~: `with untrammelled words,' i.e. 
in prose.  |per narrar pi@u volte~: `even if he repeated the
tale,' lit. `for all his repeating'; for this use of ^per~ cp.
Inf. iv. 11; xxi. 28. 

	|5-6.  Per lo~, &c.: owing to the inability of human 
language to express it, and of human intellect to grasp it. 
^seno~: lit. `bosom'; taken with ^a comprender~ it means 
`capacity for embracing.' 

	|7.  s' adunasse ancor~: these two words can hardly be 
taken together as forming a single expression; `were recalled to
life (^ancor~) and assembled.' 

	|8-9.  fortunata~: `fateful,' i.e. doomed to disaster. 
Dante now enumerates in their historical order five scenes of 
bloodshed which had occurred in Apulia (|Puglia~), using that 
name, as it was often used in the middle ages, in a wide sense, 
so as to embrace a large part of Southern Italy; cp. ^De Vulg. 
Eloq.~ i. 10. ll. 49-52, where Apulia is said to be divided in 
two parts by the Apennines.  The carnage produced by these 
battles, he says, would not equal what was displayed to view in 
this ^bolgia.~  |fu del suo sangue dolente~: `suffered from 
their wounds.' 

	|10-12.  Per li Troiani~: in the wars following Aeneas' 
landing in Italy.  |la lunga guerra~: the Second Punic War, 
including the battle of Cannae.  |dell' anella~: referring to the
bushels of rings taken by the Carthaginians from the fingers of 
the slain Roman knights after Cannae.  |alte~: `high-heaped,' 
representing the ^acervus~ of Livy xxiii. 12.  ^Livio~: his 
account of the battle is in xxii. 47 foll. 

	|13-14.  Con quella~: understand ^gente~; the Greeks and 
Saracens are meant, who were slain in their wars with the Norman
Robert Guiscard during the eleventh century.  |Per contrastare~:
`owing to their making head against.' 

	|15-16.  il cui~, &c.: `whose bones are still heaped'; 
^ossame~ (lit. `pile of bones') favours this translation, while 
^s' accoglie~ is better suited to the other, `whose bones are 
still picked up.'  |Ceperan~: on the Liris near Monte Cassino. 
This point the Apulians were to have defended against Charles of
Anjou, but they deserted their post (^bugiardo~, `faithless'). 
The massacre which is implied in ^ossame~ was the battle of 
Benevento (A.D. 1266), where Manfred was defeated; Dante's words
imply that there was an action at Ceperano, but this was not the
case. 

	|17-18.  l@a~: see note on Inf. vii. 22.  |da Tagliacozzo~:
`at Tagliacozzo' in the Abruzzi, where Manfred's nephew,
Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen, was defeated by Charles
of Anjou in 1268.  |senz' arme~: by his advice, not by fighting. 
Erard (Alardo) de Val$ery persuaded Charles to keep a third of
his forces in reserve, and when Conradin's troops thought they
had won the day and were pursuing their opponents, these attacked
and defeated them; Villani, vii. 27. 

	|19-21.  E qual~, &c.; ^se~ is here to be supplied from 
l. 7, and |qual -- qual~ refer to ^la gente~, ibid.  `And if some
of these victims showed how their limbs were pierced, others how
they were cut off, that would be nothing to compare with what was
seen,' &c. 

	|22-23.  Gi@a veggia~, &c.: `a cask was never so rifted 
from the loss of centre-piece or side-piece, as one whom I saw.'
The position of the clauses here is curiously inverted; for a 
similar instance cp. Inf. xxix. 16, 17.  |mezzul~ is the middle 
piece, |lulla~ one of the side pieces of the bottom of a cask. 

	|25-26.  minugia~: `entrails.'  `|corata'~: `vitals.' 
^sacco~: `pouch,' the stomach. 

	|30.  mi dilacco~: `I rend myself,' lit. `dismember.' 

	|31.  Maometto~: Mahomet's new departure in religion 
caused him to be regarded as a schismatic. 

	|32.  Ali~: the two great Mahometan sects -- the Shiites, 
who are now represented by the Persians, and the Sunnites, who 
are represented by the Turks -- are divided on the question 
whether Ali was or was not the rightful successor to Mahomet in 
the Caliphate the Shiites maintaining the former view, the 
Sunnites the latter.  Thus Ali came to be regarded as a source of
schism, though he did not himself found a sect.  For the ten- 
syllable line here and in the rhyming lines see note on Inf. iv.
56. 

	|33.  nel volto~: i.e. in the part of his person which in
Mahomet's case was sound, the meaning being that Ali caused a 
schism in Mahometanism. 

	|35.  scandalo~: `dissension.' 

	|37-40.  accisma~: this seems to be the same word as O. Fr. 
^acesmer~, `to set in order,' `adorn'; here `makes us such a
sight.'  For a similar ironical use cp. ^conciando~ in Inf. xxx. 
33.  |al taglio~, &c.: `putting anew to the sword's edge.' 
^risma~: `gang,' lit. `bundle,' the word being used as a term of
contempt for the occupants of the ^bolgia~, like ^zavorra~ in 
Inf. xxv. 142.  Both in origin and meaning it is the same as 
Engl. `ream' of paper, the der. being from Arab. ^rismat~, 
`bundle,' which word was imported into Europe along with the 
introduction of cotton by the Moors; Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~, s.v.
`ream.'  |Quando~, &c.: i.e. when we have completed the circle 
of the ^bolgia.~ 

	|42.  Prima~, &c.:' before any of us reappears in his 
presence.'  |altri~ for `any one' is rare; the ^Vocab. Crusca~ 
compares Tasso, xiii. 34, `Non mai la vita, ove cagion onesta Del
comun pro la chieda, altri risparmi' (`let not any one spare'). 

	|43-45.  muse~: `musest'; ^musare~ is der. from ^muso~, O.
Fr.  ^muse~, `mouth,' `snout.'  Skeat (s.v. `muse') says, `the
image is that of a dog snufling idly about.'  |tue accuse~: 
`your confession of crimes,' with reference to the self- 
accusation, when the soul confesses its sins to Minos, Inf. v. 8;
cp. also Purg. xxxi.  40, 41. 

	|55.  Or di'~: Mahomet is speaking; cp. l. 62.  |Fra
Dolcin~: the leader of a sect of fanatical religious reformers 
called the Apostolic Brothers at the end of the thirteenth 
century.  He is said (though it was probably a calumny) to have 
advocated community of wives, and this may account for the 
interest which Mahomet is here represented as taking in him.  The
circumstances referred to in what follows were these.  When 
Clement V issued a Bull for the extirpation of the sect, he and 
his followers withdrew to the hills between Novara and Vercelli,
where they occupied a strong position; but they were ultimately 
forced to surrender owing to failure of provisions and a great 
fall of snow.  Fra Dolcino was burnt alive at Vercelli in 1307. 
Dante regards him as a schismatic.  |s' armi~: take with ^di 
vivanda~ in l. 58. 

	|58-59.  stretta di neve~: `a deep snow-fall'; the first 
meaning of ^stretta~ is `a compact mass.'  |Noarese~: the people 
of Novara, who led a crusade against him. 

	|61-63.  Poi che~, &c.: if what is said here is merely a 
description of starting to walk, it is strangely elaborate, but 
there is something like it in Purg. xiii. 14, 15.  Casini takes 
it as referring to the brief interval occupied by Mahomet's 
speech, as if he were hurrying his departure.  Possibly it may 
describe his difficulty in walking owing to his body being cleft.
64 foll.  The persons who are now introduced were promoters of 
political discord. 

	|71.  Latina~: Italian. 

	|73.  Pier da Medicina~: he was so called from the town of
Medicina near Bologna.  He kept alive the strife between the 
families of Polenta and Malatesta. 

	|75.  dichina~: `slopes,' i.e. with the fall of the river. 
The plain is that of Lombardy, Vercelli lying in the western part
towards its head, Marcab@o near the mouths of the Po. 

	|77.  Guido~: he and Angiolello were two leading men of 
Fano, whom Malatestino of Rimini -- the `young Mastiff' of Inf. 
xxvii.  46 -- shortly after 1312 invited to a conference at La 
Cattolica, a coast-town between Rimini and Pesaro, and caused to
be drowned by the sailors when they were on their way thither. 

	|80.  mazzerati~: `thrown overboard'; ^mazzerare~ is to 
throw a man into the sea tied up in a sack.  |Cattolica~: for the
twelve-syllable lines here and in ll. 82, 84 see note on Inf. xv.
1. 

	|82-84.  Tra l' isola~ &c.: Cyprus and Majorca are here 
taken as marking the eastern and western limits of the 
Mediterranean.  |fallo~: `outrage.' |Argolica~: the early Greek 
settlers in Italy and Sicily were regarded not without reason, as
brigands. 

	|85.  Quel traditor~, &c.: Malatestino, who had lost an 
eye. 

	|86-87.  la terra~, &c.: `the city (Rimini), which one in my
company here would be glad never to have seen.'  This is
explained below (l. 102) to be Curio, who there advocated the 
civil strife for which he is now punished.  There is a suppressed
relative after the clause |tal @e qui meco.~  For |digiuno~ 
meaning `lacking of' cp. Inf. xviii. 42. 

	|89-90.  al vento~, &c.: `neither vows nor prayers against
the wind of Focara will be needed for them.'  Focara was a
headland near La Cattolica, which was dangerous on account of 
its storms; but they would have no need to invoke the protection
of Heaven, because they would be drowned before reaching it.  ^Fa
mestiere~ is a phrase for `it is necessary.' 

	|93.  dalla veduta amara~: to whom it is painful to have 
seen Rimini, ll. 86, 87. 

	|96.  non favella~: because his tongue was severed, l. 101. 

	|97.  scacciato~: `being banished.'  After Caesar was
declared a public enemy by the Senate, Curio fled to him from 
Rome, and urged him to commence the civil war without delay. 
According to the facts of history he reached him at Ravenna 
before he crossed the Rubicon, but Dante represents him as having
given this advice at Rimini (see note on ll. 86, 87), and 
therefore after he had crossed the Rubicon.  He is here following
Lucan, who says that after Caesar had crossed the Rubicon (i.
223, 224) he attacked Ariminum (l. 231).  and was there joined by
Curio (ll. 266-9); and when he was hesitating whether he should 
advance (l. 272), Curio used the words `Tolle moras; semper 
nocuit differre paratis' (l. 281). 

	|98-99.  il fornito~, &c.: `one who is prepared always loses
if he endures to wait'; this is a paraphrase of `semper nocuit,'
&c.  These words of Lucan are quoted by Dante in his letter to
Henry of Luxemburg, ^Epist.~ vii. 4, ll. 81-4.

	|102.  a dire...ardito~: Lucan speaks of Curio as `audax
venali lingua,' l. 269. 

	|106.  del Mosca~: Mosca Lamberti, concerning whom Dante 
had already made inquiries in Inf. vi. 80.  His story is as 
follows.  Buondelmonte, a young Florentine nobleman, was 
betrothed to a lady of the Amidei family, but married instead a 
daughter of the Donati (see Par. xvi. 140).  When the Amidei were
consulting how they could best avenge themselves for the insult,
and various counter-insults were proposed, Mosca exclaimed, `Cosa
fatta capo ha,' meaning that `Death settles a matter once for 
all'; and accordingly Buondelmonte was murdered. 

	|108.  il mal seme~: in consequence of this quarrel, the 
leading nobles of Florence ranged themselves on the side of one 
or other of these families, and ultimately the Buondelmonti took
the lead of the Guelf, the Amidei of the Ghibelline faction. 
Hence Mosca is placed among the propagators of discord. 

	|109.  E morte~, &c.: `it was death withal to thy race.'
After 1266 the Lamberti are not heard of. 

	|114.  contarla~: the use of |la~ after ^che~ preceding is
pleonastic; cp. Inf. v. 69. 

	|117.  osbergo~: `hauberk,' `breastplate.' 

	|119.~  si ^come~, &c.: walking onwards, like the rest of 
the sowers of discord, though he was without his head and could 
not see. 

	|124-126.  lucerna~: his head, thus suspended from his 
hand, enabled him to see his way.  |governa~: `ordains.' 

	|128.~  con |tutta la testa~: `and the head along with it.'
Casini quotes Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ x. 9, `il letto con tutto 
messer Torello fu tolto via.' 

	|134.  Bertram dal Bornio~: Bertrand de Born, a troubadour
and warrior of the latter half of the twelfth century, was
distinguished by his wild love of fighting, which caused him 
to propagate strife among his neighbours.  With this object he 
supported the younger Henry, eldest son of Henry II of England, 
against his father.  He is thus a type of another form of sowing
discord. 

	|135.  diedi...i mai conforti~: `gave the wrongful
encouragement.'  |re giovane~: `the Young King' was the title by 
which the younger Henry was called, because he was crowned during
his father's lifetime; Villani (v. 4) speaks of him by that name,
when he mentions his having been at war with his father.  The MS.
authority is extremely strong in favour of the reading
^Giovanni~, but this appears to have arisen from a mistake on the
part of the copyists, who confused the young Henry with his 
younger brother, John Lackland.  It seems almost impossible that
Dante should have been in error on this point, because the title
of `the Young King,' as applied to the eldest son of Henry II, 
was well known at that time in Italy, and is also frequently 
introduced into the poems of Bertrand de Born.  See Moore, ^Text.
Crit.~, pp. 344 foll.; Toynbee in ^The Academy~, vol. xxxiii. p.
274. 

	|136-138.  ribelli~: `hostile.'  |Achitofel~: 2 Sam. xv. 12 
foll.  |non fe' pi@u d'~: `did not more so with,' i.e. `did not 
stir up more ill-will between.' 

	|141-142.  suo principio~: the spinal marrow.  |lo
contrapasso~: the law of retaliation.
