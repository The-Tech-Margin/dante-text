	|4.  la lancia~, &c.: the classical fable here referred to
is, that a wound inflicted by the spear of Achilles could only be
healed by applying to it rust taken from the spear.  In the
mediaeval form of the story it is not the rust, but the
application of the spear itself, which effects the cure.  An 
additional point of interest is found in the mention by Dante of
the father of Achilles, i.e. Peleus, as having first possessed
the spear.  This feature is found in Homer, ^Il.~ xvi. 143, 
%Pi%eta%lambda%iota%alpha%delta%alpha\
%mu%eta%lambda%iota$eta%nu\, %tau%eta%nu\ %pi%alpha%tau%rho%iota\
%phi%iota%lambda%psi\ 
%pi%omicron%rho%epsilon\ %chi%epsilon%iota%rho%omega%nu\ 
%Pi%eta%lambda%iota%omicron%nu\ %epsilon%kappa\ 
%kappa%omicron%rho%nu%phi%eta%sigma\: but Dante was unacquainted
with Homer, and as it is not given by any Latin writer he could
not have obtained it from a classical source.  The story,
however, including this point, is of frequent occurrence in the
early mediaeval poets (see the quotations in Toynbee, ^Dict.~ p.
422), and from them Dante obtained it.  There can be little doubt
that the idea that the spear first belonged to Peleus was
suggested to their minds by a mistranslation of `Pelias hasta' in
Ovid's line, `Vulneris auxilium Pelias hasta tulit' (^Rem.
Amor.~, l. 48), where the meaning is not, as they supposed, `the
spear of Peleus,' but `the spear from Mount Pelion' 
(%Pi%eta%lambda%iota%alpha%delta%alpha\
%mu%epsilon%lambda%iota%eta%nu\). 

	|6.  mancia~: `gift,' the two gifts here were the wound 
and the remedy. 

	|12.  corno~: this horn, as we subsequently learn (l. 71),
was sounded by Nimrod, who is reckoned among the giants. 

	|14-15.  seguitando~: `as my eyes followed the course of the
sound in an opposite direction to it.'  The gerund |seguitando~
here is used as equivalent to a participle.  |tutti~: `wholly';
cp. Inf. xix. 64.  |ad un loco~: i.e. to the point from which it
seemed to come. 

	|16.  rotta~: the defeat and destruction at Roncesvalles 
on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees in 778 of the rear-guard of 
Charlemagne's army, commanded by his nephew Roland (Orlando), at
the conclusion of Charlemagne's expedition into Spain against the
Saracens.  This disaster, which is related by Eginhard ^Vita
Caroli~, {part} 9), was the work of the Gascon mountaineers, 
who overwhelmed and plundered that part of his forces; but in 
Dante's time it was attributed to the Saracens. 

	|17.  la santa gesta~: `the sacred host'; sacred, because 
of the crusade on which they had been engaged.  |gesta~ is here 
used in the same way as O. Fr. ^geste~, which often signifies 
`host' in the early romances. 

	|18.  Orlando~: Orlando's horn, the sound of which is 
frequently referred to in poetry, on this occasion is said to 
have been heard by Charlemagne at a distance of eight miles from
Roncesvalles; Turpin, ^Chronicle~, {part} 23. 

	|19-21.  Poco~: take with |Che~ in l. 20, `Not long...when';
cp. Inf. xvi. 91, 92.  |terra~: `city.' 

	|22-23.  Per@o che~, &c.: `because thou peerest (lit. 
penetratest) through the darkness from too far off.'  The form 
|dalla lungi~ seems to be intermediate between ^da lungi~, Inf. 
viii. 5, and ^a lunga~, Inf. ix. 5: the fem. gender is used
because ^distanza~ or ^parte~ is understood. 

	|27.  nel `maginare aborri~: `thou wanderest in thy
fancies.'  |aborri~: from Lat. ^aberrare~; cp. ^abborra~ in Inf. 
xxv. 144. 

	|25-27.  l@a ti congiungi~: `approach that place,' lit.
`bring thyself near there.'  |alquanto~, &c.: `press on (lit.
spur thyself on) a little more.' 

	|31.  giganti~: these giants are the mythological figures 
of the ninth Circle.  The reason why Dante places them in the Pit
of Hell is to be found in Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 580, 581, `Hic genus 
antiquum terrae, Titania pubes, Fulmine deiecti fundo volvuntur 
in imo.'  The description of the giants as resembling towers when
first seen through the murky air is an example of Dante's method
of introducing an unusually impressive sight by the aid of an 
intermediate stage, in order to render its realization more easy.
Similarly, in Canto XXX of the Paradiso, the Heavenly Host, 
before it is finally revealed to Dante's sight, is presented to 
him in the figure of a river of light with sparks issuing from 
it. 

	|36.  che l' aere stipa~: `which thickens the air.' 

	|41.  Montereggion~: the castle of Montereggione stands
about eight miles to the N. of Siena on the road to Empoli.  Its
resemblance to Dante's description is very remarkable.  It is 
round in shape, and the walls (|la cerchia tonda~) remain to the 
height of 50 or 60 feet, with twelve towers in them, which rise 
at intervals above the line of circuit.  At the present day, the
space thus enclosed is partly occupied by a village of 200 
inhabitants. 

	|43-44.  Torreggiavan~: `crowned as with towers.' 
|minaccia~: as Jupiter subdued the giants, when they made war on
the Gods, by his thunderbolts (see Inf. xiv. 58), the sound of 
thunder is a perpetual reminder to them of what they have to fear
if they attempt to revolt. 

	|48.  per le coste gi@u~: `down along their sides.' 

	|49-51.  quando~, &c.: `when she ceased from the craft of 
producing creatures like these.'  |Per torre~, &c.: `to deprive 
Mars (the god of distinction) of such ministers.' 

	|52-57.~  Dante is here answering a supposed objection, that
if Nature was right in ceasing to create giants she ought also to
cease from creating other monsters, such as elephants and whales. 
He replies that it is the possession of reason by the former
which renders them especially dangerous. 

	|53.  Non si pente~: `does not repent of (and therefore 
cease from) creating. 

	|55.  l' argomento della mente~: `the equipment of the
mind,' i.e. the reasoning faculties; for this use of |argomemto~
cp. Purg. ii. 31; xxx. 136.  Dante here had in his mind
Aristotle, ^Pol.~ i. 2. 16,
%chi%alpha%lambda%epsilon%pi%omega%tau%alpha%tai%eta\ 
%gamma%alpha%rho\ %alpha%delta%iota%kappa%iota%alpha\ 
%epsilon%chi%omicron%nu%sigma%alpha\ %omicron%pi%lambda%alpha\,
%kappa%tau%lambda\. 

	|59.  la pina~: the bronze pine-cone, which is believed to
have originally stood on the summit of the Mausoleum of Hadrian,
and in Dante's time was in a portico in front of the old basilica
of St. Peter at Rome.  It is now in one of the gardens of the
Vatican at the back of St. Peter's.  Its height is 11 feet. 

	|61.  era perizoma~: `served him for a skirt,' lit. `apron';
|perizoma~, which is properly a Greek word, is taken from the
Vulg. of Gen. iii. 7, of Adam and Eve, `fecerunt sibi
perizomata.'  The meaning is, that the lower half of the giant's
body was concealed by the rock; cp. ll. 32, 33. 

	|63.  chioma~: the part of the body here intended by `the 
hair' seems to be the collar-bone, thus corresponding to `the 
place where a man buckles his cloak,' l. 66. 

	|64.  Frison~: the Frieslanders were noted for their great
stature. 

	|65.  gran palmi~: `ample spans.'  Casini estimates the
^palmo~ at 24 centimetres, and on this computation 30 ^palmi~ -- 
the measure of the giant from his collar-bone to his waist -- 
would correspond to 211/2 ft.: adding 11 feet for the head and 
something for the neck, the upper half of the giant would be 
about 35 feet, and his total stature about 70 feet. 

	|67.  Rafel~, &c.: these words are the incoherent utterances
of a wild and fierce being: they are shown to be unintelligible
by l. 81.  Observe that the metre of this line is imperfect,
there being only ten syllables; and the lost syllable is not, as
in other ten-syllable lines, the final one or hypermeter -- for
^$almi~ is accented on the first syllable, as is shown by the
rhyming words ^palmi~ and ^salmi~ -- and consequently it is
omitted from the body of the verse.  Probably the Poet intended
in this way to make the incoherency still more conspicuous. 

	|71.  Tienti col corno~: `keep to your horn'; ^tenersi con~
is here used in the sense of ^attenersi a.~  The horn is no 
doubt assigned to Nimrod because he was `a mighty hunter,' Gen. 
x. 9. 

	|73-75.  soga~: `cord'; it is the Low Lat. word for `rope';
Diez, p. 297.  |doga~: `crosses'; ^dogare~ is `to fix the staves
of a barrel' (^doghe~). 

	|76.  s' accusa~: i.e. his confusion of mind and
unintelligible speech mark him out as the author of the Confusion
of Tongues. 

	|77.  Nembrotto~: the idea that Nimrod was a giant and built
the Tower of Babel is not found in the Bible.  Dante, who repeats
these statements in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 7, ll. 24-31, probably
found them in St. Augustine, ^De Civ. Dei~, xvi. 3, 4, where both
occur.  |coto~: `thought,' Lat. ^co@itatum~; see note on Par.
iii. 26. 

	|84.  l' altro~: `the next.' 

	|85-87.  A cinger~, &c.: `who it was that had the power to
bind him I cannot say, but he (Ephialtes, l. 94) was holding his
left hand pinioned in front,' &c. 

	|89-90.  si che~, &c.: `so that on the part of his body that
was visible (above the bank) it wound round to the number of five
coils.' 

	|94.  Fialte~: the only place in the classical writers with
whom Dante was acquainted, where the giant Ephialtes is
mentioned, is Virg. ^Culex~, l. 234, but he may have found his 
name also in Servius on Virg. ^Georg.~ i. 280; see Toynbee, 
^Dict.~, p. 234. 

	|98.  Briareo~: Briareus, the hundred-handed giant; Stat. 
^Theb.~ ii. 595 foll., where ^immensus~, l. 596, is the original
of |ismisurato~ here. 

	|100-102.  Anteo~: Antaeus, who is best known for his 
combat with Hercules, by whom he was slain, was not present at 
the battle with the Gods (ll. 119-21), and it is probably for 
that reason that he is not chained (|disciolto).  |parla~: speaks
intelligibly, not like Nimrod.  |nel fondo~, &c.: `in the lowest
depth of guilt,' i.e. in the Pit of Hell. 

	|106-108.  Non fu~, &c.: `never was earthquake of such 
violence, as to shake a tower so mightily as Ephialtes in a 
moment shook himself.'  This movement was an indication of 
Ephialtes' wrath at being described as less fierce than Briareus.

	|109-110.~  temetti: for ^temei~; cp. Inf. xxi. 93.  |E
non~, &c.: `and to cause death nothing beyond the apprehension 
was needed.' |dotta~ is connected with ^dubitare.~ 

	|112-114.  allotta~: for ^allora~; cp. Inf. v. 53.  |alle~: 
`ells.'  The old commentators are not agreed what measure of 
length is here intended, but it was evidently more than the 
English ell.  |uscia~, &c.: `stood out above the rock,' which 
formed the bank between the eighth and ninth Circles. 

	|115.  fortunata~: `fateful'; cp. Inf. xxviii. 8.  The
valley of Bagrada near Zama -- the scene of Hannibal's defeat by
Scipio -- is meant, where, according to Lucan, iv. 587 foll., 
Antaeus had his abode. 

	|118.  Recasti~, &c.: Lucan says of him (iv. 601, 602), 
`latuisse sub alta Rupe ferunt, epulas raptos habuisse leones.' 
This compliment on Virgil's part, and still more the suggestion 
that with his aid the giants might have conquered the Gods (which
is also from Lucan, ll. 596, 597), are intended to propitiate 
Antaeus.  The Poet for once becomes `all things to all men,' 
following the maxim which Dante quotes, `nella chiesa Coi santi,
ed in taverna coi ghiottoni,' Inf. xxii. 14. 

	|119.  che~: this refers to ^tu~ in l. 115; unless it is 
redundant, it must be taken as `concerning whom' with |e' si 
creda.~ 

	|122-123.  schifo~: subst., `disdain.'  |Dove~, &c.: `where
the cold congeals (lit. locks up) Cocytus.'  Cocytus is formed by
the waters that descend from the upper part of Hell; cp. Inf.
xiv. 112 foll. 

	|124.  Non ci far~, &c.: `force us not to betake ourselves
to your brother giants, Tityus or Typhon'; this is an appeal to
Antaeus' jealousy.  Here again the names are borrowed from Lucan,
ll. 595, 596. 

	|125-126.  quel che~, &c.: viz. to be remembered on earth,
as we see from l. 127.  |torcer lo grifo~: `make a wry mouth' to
display unwillingness. 

	|132.  Ond' Ercole~, &c.: `the hands, of which Hercules erst
felt the mighty grip,' lit. `from which Hercules once felt great
pressure.'  The contest between Hercules and Antaeus was
suggested to Dante in this connexion through its being narrated
by Lucan in iv. 609 foll. 

	|136.  la Carisenda~: the lower of the two leaning towers 
of Bologna, which are out of the perpendicular owing to a 
settlement of the foundations.  This one, which got its name from
having been built by members of the Garisendi family, is 163 ft.
in height, and 10 ft. out of the perpendicular. 

	|137-138.  Sotto il chinato~: i.e. to one looking from
beneath its incline.  |quando~, &c.: `when a cloud passes over it
in such a manner that the tower inclines towards it.'  What is 
here described is an optical illusion, when a cloud passing 
through the sky in the opposite direction to the incline appears
to stand still, and the tower seems to be falling.  This exactly
illustrates ll. 139, 140, where Antaeus bends over the two Poets
as he deposits them below him. 

	|139-140.  stava a bada~: `was on the watch.'  |fu tal ora~,
&c.: `it was so dread a moment that,' &c. 

	|142-143.  divora~: `engulfs.' |spos@o~: `set us down'; 
from ^sposare~ (= ^posare~). 

	|145.  albero~: the mast here intended is one that could 
be raised or lowered, resting on a crutch.  |lev@o~: the ten- 
syllable line with its abrupt termination, especially as it 
concludes the Canto, is probably an adaptation of sound to sense,
being intended to express the suddenness of the rebound. 
Possibly the three other instances in the poem of ten-syllable 
lines which cannot otherwise be accounted for, may be explained 
in this manner, for in each case one of the rhyming lines 
expresses something sudden or abrupt; viz. Inf. xxiii. 145, 
`Appresso il Duca a gran passi sen g@i'; Purg. vii. 10, `Qual 
@e colui che cosa innanzi s@e Subita vede'; Par. xxv. 100, 
`Poscia tra esse un lume si schiar@i.'  For explanations of the 
other ten-syllable line see notes on Inf. iv. 56 and Purg. xxiii.
74.
