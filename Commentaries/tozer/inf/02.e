|Proemio~ 

	The office which Virgil discharges in the ^Divina Commedia~
is that of being Dante's guide in his journey through Hell and
Purgatory.  In the allegory of the poem he symbolizes human
reason in its highest development, while Beatrice, who conducts
the poet through Paradise, represents theology or revealed truth;
this is clearly explained in Purg. xviii. 46-8.  Thus in the
first two ^Cantiche~, where moral questions -- the punishment
which sin brings in its train, and the discipline by which its
injurious effects can be remedied -- are being treated of, the
knowledge with which Virgil is gifted suffices for Dante's
guidance; but in the third section of the poem, which deals 
with spiritual truths and heavenly mysteries, the aid of an
inspired teacher is required for his instruction.  The relation
in which Dante's two guides stand to one another is shown in the
Earthly Paradise, where, as soon as Beatrice appears on the
scene, Virgil, the object of whose mission is now accomplished,
disappears (Purg. xxx. 49).  We may assume that Dante's primary
reason for assigning to Virgil so prominent a place in the action
of the poem was his sense of the debt which he owed him in
respect of the formation of his own poetic style.  This feeling
on his part towards the Roman poet he definitely expresses in 
Inf. i. 85-7.  He also admired him as being in the ^Aeneid~ the
poet of the Roman Empire, the belief in which institution was the
basis of his own political creed.  At the same time it was only
natural that Dante should select him to be the representative of
human intelligence, in consequence of the extraordinarily high
estimate that was formed of his powers during the middle ages. 
From various causes, in the minds of the vulgar Virgil had come
to be regarded as a powerful magician, and among the learned the
character almost of omniscience was attributed to him; while
Christian teachers -- chiefly owing to the supposed prediction of
the birth of Christ contained in his Fourth Eclogue -- in some
cases ranked him among the ancient Prophets.  Dante himself in
Inf. i. 89 addresses him as ^famoso saggio~; and in Purg. xxii.
73 Statius is made to attribute his conversion to Christianity to
his prophecy.  (See on this subject Comparetti, ^Vergil in the
Middle Ages~; trans. by E. F. M. Benecke.)  Dante also no doubt
felt that the fact of his companion and guide being a famous poet
would contribute to the treatment of the subject an element of
grace and sympathy which would otherwise be lacking; and this
result of their spiritual affinity constantly impresses itself on
his readers in the courteous and affectionate relations which
they feel to exist between them. 

	|1.  Lo giorno se n' andava~: the time is the evening of
Good Friday, April 8, 1300.  That the day was Good Friday is
clearly implied by what is said in Inf. xxi. 112 (where see
note).  That the year was 1300 A.D. has already been deduced from
what is said in Inf. i. 1 concerning Dante's age at the time of
his Vision; and in that year according to the calendar Good 
Friday fell on April 8.  From the determination of Good Friday 
evening as the time of Dante's entrance into Hell, it further 
follows that he passed the Thursday night preceding in the 
^selva~ (Inf. i. 21), and that the whole of Good Friday was 
occupied by the struggle with the Beasts and his meeting with 
Virgil.  It should be noticed that Eastertide 1300 is carefully 
observed throughout the ^Div. Com.~ as the date of Dante's
Vision, so that all references in the poem to events of a later 
date than this are to be regarded as prophetic.  (For additional
proofs of the points mentioned above see Moore's ^Time-References
in the Divina Commedia~, pp. 6 foll.) 

	|4-6.  la guerra~: `the painful struggle.'  |ritrarr@a~: 
`will recount'; cp. Inf. iv. 145.  |che non erra~: not
`unerring,' `infallible,' but `which does not stray,' as being 
fixed intently on its purpose. 

	|7.  O Muse~: Dante defends the use of poetical invocations
in his letter to Can Grande, ^Epist.~ x. {part} 18, ll. 306-12. 
Observe that the invocation, which in the two other ^Cantiche~
occurs in Canto I (Purg. i. 8; Par. i. 13), is here found in
Canto II, the reason being that Canto I is introductory to the
whole poem.  This is also the explanation of there being
thirty-four Cantos in the Inferno, whereas there are thirty-three
in the other parts.  |ingegno~: `spirit of genius,' of which the
Muses are the representatives. 

	|8.  scrivesti~: sc. on the tablets of memory; cp. Inf. 
xv. 88. 

	|12.  alto passo~: `hazardous transit' through the world 
of spirits.  |alto~ adds a superlative force to the substantive,
like that of `supreme' in English; and so in the present 
connexion may mean `dread,' `momentous,' or `hazardous.' 

	|13-15.  di Silvio lo parente~: Aeneas, whose son Silvius 
is mentioned in ^Aen.~ vi. 763.  |Corruttibile ancora~: `while 
still clothed in human flesh'; cp. 1 Cor. xv. 53, `for this 
corruptible,' &c.  |secolo~: `world'; Virgil in the sixth Aeneid
has described Aeneas' visit to the world of spirits.  |fu 
sensibilmente~: `was there in the body,' not in a vision. 

	|16-19.  Per@o~, &c.: `Wherefore, if the adversary of all 
evil (God) was gracious to him, in consideration of the mighty 
result which was to proceed from him (viz. the Roman Empire), and
the person (the Emperor), and his greatness, this cannot but 
approve itself to a reflecting mind.'  According to Dante's 
political views, which he has developed in the ^De Monarchia~, 
the Roman Empire was the embodiment of the true principles of 
government, and the type to be followed in succeeding ages.  |i~:
= ^gli~; cp. Inf. xxii. 73; Par. xxix. 17.  |il chi, e il 
quale~: these expressions are the ^quis~ and ^qualis~ of the 
Schools; |quale~, lit. `of what sort,' i.e. how great. 

	|20.  alma~: `fostering.' |suo impero~: note the synizesis,
^suo im-~ being pronounced as one syllable. 

	|22-24.  a voler dir lo vero~: this form of asseveration 
seems to be a profession of faith on Dante's part in the 
relationship of the Empire and the Church which is here implied;
perhaps also it contains an apology to Virgil for giving a 
Christian interpretation (and therefore a different one from his)
of the foundation of the Roman Empire.  |maggior~: the most 
exalted of that name. 

	|25-27.  onde~, &c.: `for which thou dost celebrate him,' 
in the sixth Aeneid.  |Intese cose~, &c.: the meaning is: -- He 
heard the prophecies concerning the Roman Empire, which gave him
confidence to conquer Italy, and so to cause the foundation of 
Rome, the future seat of the Papacy. 

	|28-30.  Andovvi~, &c.  St. Paul, the `chosen vessel' (Acts
ix. 15) was caught up to the third heaven (2 Cor. xii. 2).  |vi~
= ^ad immortale secolo~, l. 14.  |conforto~, &c.: `support
(derived from the sight of the spiritual world) to faith, which
is the startingpoint,' &c. 

	|31-33.  io perch@e venirvi~: `why should I come thither'; 
the infin. is used, because it is a rhetorical question, which 
does not expect an answer, and it is hurriedly uttered.  |il 
crede~: `believes this,' viz. that I am worthy. 

	|34-36.  se del venire~, &c.: `if I consent to come,' lit. 
`if I resign myself in the matter of coming.'  For the use of 
^abbandonarsi~ cp. Purg. xvii. 136; Par. xvii. 108; xxxi. 75. 
|me' ch' io non ragiono~: `better than I express it in words.' 

	|39.  dal cominciar~, &c.: `withdraws wholly from what he 
has begun.' 

	|41.  Perch@e~, &c.: `so that through reflexion I cancelled
the enterprise.' 

	|45.  offesa~: `impeded,' as by a stumbling-block; `the 
impediment that checks thy spirit is cowardice.' 

	|48.  falso veder~: `mistake of sight.' 

	|52-53.  sospesi~: `in the intermediate state' -- a
condition intermediate between salvation and damnation, that of 
Limbo; cp. Inf. iv. 45.  |donna~: Beatrice; see l. 70. 

	|55.  la stella~: for `the stars' generally.  Cp. ^Vita 
Nuova~, {part} 23 ll. 176, 177, `Poi mi parve vedere appoco
appoco Turbar lo Sole ed apparir la stella'; ^Conv.~ iv. 19, ll.
30, 31, `Siccome |@e `l~ cielo, dovunque |@e~ la stella'; also 
the use of ^la fiammella~ for ^le fiammelle~ in Inf. xvii. 33. 

	|56.  soave e piana~: take ^in sua favella~ with this -- 
`in sweet low tones,' lit. `sweet and low in her manner of 
speaking.' 

	|60.  quanto il moto lontana~: the meaning is `to the end 
of time,' lit. `as far as motion extends into the distance,' the 
motion being that of the heavenly bodies, by which time is 
determined.  ^mondo~ is also read here, and it is difficult to 
decide whether this or ^moto~ is right.  As regards the authority
of the MSS., the balance is slightly in favour of ^mondo~; on the
other hand, ^moto~ is the harder of the two to explain, and 
therefore the less likely to have been substituted for another 
reading (see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 270-272).  The general 
meaning with ^mondo~ is practically the same as with ^moto~, viz.
`to the end of the world,' lit. `so long as the world is ever 
moving onward.'  Some authorities regard |lontana~ not as a verb
(for ^si lontana~), but as an adj., agreeing with ^fama~; in this
case the construction will be, `la fama durer@a tanto lontana 
(`so far into the distant ages') quanto il moto (or, mondo) 
durer@a.' 

	|61.  L' amico~, &c.: `one whom I love, but fortune loveth
not.' 

	|66.  Per quel~, &c.: `from what I have heard'; this is 
explained in ll. 107, 108. 

	|67.  parola orata~: `skill in speech'; cp. ^parole ornate~
in Inf. xviii. 91. 

	|70.  Beatrice~: on the position which she occupies in 
the scheme of the poem see the Prefatory note to this Canto. 

	|74.  Di te mi loder@o~: `I will express myself pleased 
with thee'; this is the proper meaning of ^lodarsi di~; cp. Inf.
xxii. 84, `ciascun se ne loda.'  It is noticeable that the 
present passage implies that the consciousness of God's 
approbation could be a source of happiness to a spirit in Limbo.
This view seems to be corroborated by a passage in the Appendix 
to St. Thomas Aquinas' ^Summa~, Q. 1, Art. 2, referring to the 
position of unbaptized children in Limbo, who were excluded from
heaven for the same cause as the virtuous heathen, viz. from the
lack of Christian faith and baptism.  `Quamvis pueri non
baptizati sint separati a Deo quantum ad illam coniunctionem quae
est per gloriam, non tamen ab eo penitus sunt separati, immo ei 
coniunguntur per participationem naturalium bonorum; et ita etiam
de Ipso gaudere poterunt naturali cognitione et dilectione.' 

	|75.  tacette~: for ^tacque~; cp. Inf. xxvii. 98. 

	|76-78.  sola per cui~, &c.: the meaning of this, as 
addressed to Beatrice, is, `It is only by means of Theology, i.e.
the knowledge of Divine truth, that the thoughts of man rise
above this sublunary sphere.'  The first of the concentric 
spheres which form Dante's heaven is that of the moon (see 
Prefatory Note to Canto I of the Paradiso); and as this is the 
nearest to the earth, which is the centre of the system, it is 
the smallest -- |ha minor li cerchi sui.~  Thus the expression 
`everything contained by that heaven' -- |ogni contento Da quel 
ciel~ -- is equivalent to `everything sublunary.'  The idea which
is embodied in these lines was probably suggested to Dante by a 
passage in Cicero's ^Somnium Scipionis~, with which work we know
from Par. xxii. 133 foll. that he was familiar.  It is there said
of the sphere of the moon ({part} 4) -- `Infra autem iam nihil
est nisi mortale et caducum praeter animos munere Deorum hominum
generi datos: supra lunam sunt aeterna omnia'; after which it is
added ({part} 6) -- `haec caelestia semper spectato, illa humana
contemnito.' 

	|79-81.~  These lines must be taken in connexion with what
follows in l. 82, ^Ma dimmi la cagion~, &c.  Virgil assures
Beatrice of his anxiety to comply at once with her request, but 
at the same time his longing for an explanation of her 
willingness to descend from heaven to hell overpowers his desire
to do so.  First he says, with polite extravagance of speech, 
`obedience to your behests comes to me all too late, even were it
already paid,' in other words, `I would readily, and more than 
readily, obey on the spot' -- `but,' he adds, `I am anxious first
to ask a question.'  |talento~: `desire.'

	|82-84.  |che~: `for which (reason),' `why.'  |centro~:
according to Dante the earth was the centre of the universe, and
hell extended from just within the surface of the earth to its
centre.  |ampio loco~: the highest or Empyrean heaven, the seat
of the Blessed, which embraces the other spheres of Paradise; cp.
Purg. xxvi. 63, `pi@u ampio si spazia.' 

	|85.  saper cotanto addentro~: `to know so much of the 
heart of the matter,' `investigate the matter so closely.' 

	|89.  altrui~: `persons,' `men'; cp. Inf. i. 18; Purg. 
iv. 54. 

	|91.  sua merc@e~: `thanks to him,' an elliptical 
expression. 

	|94-96.  Donna @e gentil~: the Blessed Virgin is meant, 
who symbolizes prevenient grace.  Her name, like that of Christ 
and other sacred names, is not allowed to be pronounced in Hell;
see note on Inf. iv. 53.  |impedimento~: `the hindrance to 
Dante's onward course.'  |ove~: `to deal with which.'  |S@i che~,
&c.: `so that she mitigates the strictness of God's judgement,' 
i.e. she causes mercy to prevail against justice in Dante's 
case. 

	|97.  Luci@a~: St. Lucy the martyr of Syracuse, who 
represents illuminative grace.  This idea arose from her name 
(^Lucia~ from ^luce~), and for this reason she is represented in
art as carrying a lamp (Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, vol.
ii. p. 614). 

	|98.  il tuo fedele~: this expression implies that Dante 
was a devotee of St. Lucy.  This was probably due to her being 
the patron saint of those who suffered from diseases of the eyes
(Jameson, ^op. cit.~, p. 617), for Dante tells us that he was 
affected by weakness of sight, first through weeping for the loss
of Beatrice (^Vita Nuova~, {part} 32, ll. 1-4), and afterwards
from the effects of overmuch reading (^Conv.~ iii. 9, ll.
149-153). 

	|100-102.  nimica~, &c.: gentleness was one of St. Lucy's 
characteristics.  Probably, as the term ^crudelitas~ in Aquinas 
is used of `over-severity in punishment,' it is implied here that
she would naturally second the efforts of the Virgin to cause 
mercy to triumph over justice.  |che~: `I who was sitting'; or 
perhaps, `where,' the notion of place being supplied by the 
antecedent ^loco.~  |con l' antica Rachele~: cp. Par. xxxii. 8, 
9. 

	|103-105.  loda di Dio vera~: cp. ^Vita Nuova~, {part} 26,
ll. 17-19, `Ed altri dicevano: Questa @e una meraviglia; che
benedetto sia lo Signore che s@i mirabilmente sa operare.' 
|usc@io per te~: it was his determination to celebrate Beatrice 
which caused him to devote himself to study, and thus to rise to
distinction; ibid. {paragraph} 43, ll. 1-7. 

	|108.  la fiumana~, &c.: `the rushing torrent, than which 
the sea is not wilder,' lit. `over which the sea may not boast 
itself.'  |Fiumana~ signifies `a full rushing stream.'  The 
meaning of the passage is not literal, but spiritual and 
allegorical.  The rushing stream is the `world,' and the death 
which threatens Dante is spiritual ruin. 

	|113-114.  parlare onesto~: `skill in speech,' like the 
^parola ornata~ of l. 67.  |e quei~, &c.: the meaning apparently
is: -- `and those who have heard and imitated it'; cp. Inf. i.
86, 87. 

	|118-119.  volse~: for ^volle~; cp. Inf. xxix. 102.  |quella
fiera~: the wolf; cp. Inf. i. 49-54. 

	|121-122.  Dunque che @e?~ this is the answer to Dante's 
objections as to his fitness for the journey.  |allette~: for 
^alletti~, `give entrance to'; ^allettare~ is from Lat. 
^adlectare~, `to entice,' `invite,' frequentative of ^allicere~;
cp. the use of ^allettarsi~ for `to find entrance' in Inf. ix. 
93. 

	|128.  gl' imbianca~: `lightens upon them'; cp. Par. vii. 
81. 

	|132.  franca~: `resolute.' 

	|142.  alto e silvestro~: `deep and wild.'  For ^alto~ in 
this sense cp. Inf. xvi. 114, `alto burrato.'  The meaning `deep'
is suitable here, because the way lay through a valley (Inf. i. 
14); and its association with |silvestro~ suggests that it is a 
descriptive epithet.  ^Cammin silvestro~ for `wild road' occurs 
again in Inf. xxi. 84.
