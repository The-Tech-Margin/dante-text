	|2.  N' andavam~: they were still following in a leftward
direction (Inf. xxi. 136) the ridge of the embankment which
separates the fifth from the sixth ^bolgia~ (Inf. xxi. 65).

	|3.  frati minor~: Minor Friars, i.e. Franciscans.  The 
Anonimo Fiorentino says that it was their custom to walk in 
single file, the brother of higher position going first. 

	|4.  favola d' Isopo~: the story of the Frog and the Mouse
which is here referred to is not one of Aesop's Fables, but it is
found in some of the various collections of tales which passed
current under that name in the middle ages.  It appears in 
somewhat different forms, but as the point of Dante's comparison 
is that a person who was conspiring against another (Alichino 
against Ciampolo) brought disaster upon himself, the following 
seems to be the nearest of the versions which have come down to 
us to that which Dante had in his mind.  A mouse and a frog came
together to a river which they had to cross, and as the mouse 
could not swim, the frog proposed to convey her across by tying 
her to his leg.  During their passage the frog tried to drown the
mouse, but at this moment a kite swooped down and carried off the
frog, setting the mouse at liberty.  This is found in the
collection translated by Marie de France in the twelfth century.
See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 219. 

	|7.  mo ed issa~: both these words mean `now,' |mo~ being 
Lat. ^modo~, |issa~ Lat. ^ipsa~ (understand ^hora~).  They were
both in common use in Dante's time; Blanc, ^Versuch~, p. 208. 

	|16.  s' agguega~: `is added.'  The original meaning of 
^aggueffare~ is `to weave on to,' the latter part of the compound
being from O. Germ. ^wifan~ (Mod. Germ. ^weben~); Diez, ^W,ort.~,
p. 351, who compares the use of ^attexere~ for (1) `to weave on
to,' (2) `to add,' in Latin. 

	|23.  Malebranche~: a general name for these devils, as in
Inf. xxi. 37. 

	|25-27.  S' io fossi~, &c.: `if I were a mirror, I should 
not more immediately assimilate your outward form, than I now 
receive the image of your thoughts' (|la tua imagine d' entro~). 
For |impiombato vetro~ in the sense of `a mirror' cp. Par. ii. 
89, 90.  |impetro~: `receive,' `obtain'; ^impetrare~, from 
meaning `to obtain by asking,' here signifies `to become 
possessed of.' 

	|30.  d' intrambi~, &c.: `from the two corresponding 
thoughts I evolved a single purpose,' viz. that of flight. 

	|31-33.  la destra costa~: i.e. the descent to the sixth 
^bolgia~, which would be on their right, since they were 
proceeding leftwards along the embankment.  |giaccia~: `slopes';
cp. l. 138, and Purg. iii. 76.  |scendere~: on this line and 
those which rhyme with it as being twelve-syllable lines, see 
note on Inf. xv. 1.  |immaginata~: `which we have been picturing
to ourselves.' 

	|38.  al romore~: `at the cries' of the neighbours. 

	|42.  Tanto che~, &c.: take with ^s' arresta~ above; `does
not wait long enough to put on even an under-garment.' 

	|44-45.  Supin~, &c.: `in a reclining posture slid down 
(lit. committed himself to) the sloping rock'; Virgil makes a 
sort of glissade.  |tura~: `encloses,' lit. `stops up.' 

	|47-49.  molin terragno~: `a mill on land,' where the water
is brought to the wheel by a sloping channel (|doccia~), as 
distinguished from mills in rivers, where the water flows below.
Benvenuto distinguishes between ^motendinum terrestre~, which 
means a mill with over-shot wheel, and ^motendinum positum in 
aqua magna~, which latter he illustrates by the mills in the Po.
|Quand' ella~, &c.: the fall of water in such a channel is 
steeper as it approaches the mill-wheel.  |pale~: the paddles of
the wheel.  |vivagno~: `bank,' lit. `selvage.' 

	|54.  Sopresso~: `just over'; see note on Inf. xxxiv. 41. 
|gli~: `there' = ^vi~, as in Purg. viii. 69; xiii. 7. 
|sospetto~: `cause for fear.' 

	|58.  dipinta~: this epithet refers to the gilding of their
capes, l. 64.  The spirits here met with are the hypocrites. 

	|61.  cappe~, &c.: `capes with low cowls coming down in 
front of their eyes.' 

	|63.  Cologna~: Witte reads ^Clugn@i.~  The MS. authority 
is considerably stronger for |Cologna~, but it is against this 
reading (1) that ^Cologna~, being the more familiar name, would 
be less likely to be changed into ^Clugni~ than ^vice versa~; (2)
that the line |Ch$e in Coll$ogna / p$er li / m$ona/ci f$as/si~ 
violates the stringent metrical rule, that there must be an 
accent either on the fourth or the sixth syllable of the verse. 
Consciousness of this rule may have produced the important 
variant, which is found in two of Witte's four test MSS., ^Che
per li monaci in Cologna fassi~; but this can hardly have been the
original reading, being evidently ^lectio facilior.~  With the
reading ^Che in Clugn@i~ there is a certain irregularity in the
non-elision of ^Che~, but this, though unusual, is found in a
fair number of lines in the poem.  By ^Clugni~ the Benedictine
abbey of Cluny, twelve miles from Macon in Burgundy, would be
meant.  Nothing is known about the cowls worn either in Cologne
or at Cluny. 

	|64.  Di fuor dorate~: the bright external appearance of 
the cloaks, contrasting with the dull leaden colour within, 
symbolizes the doublefaced character of hypocrisy.  This idea, 
and with it the mode of punishment of the hypocrites, seems to 
have been suggested to Dante's mind by a false etymology of 
^hypocrita~, which was current in the middle ages, from ^yper~ 
(Gk. %upsilon%pi%epsilon%rho\), `above,' and ^crisis~ (Gk. 
%chi%rho%upsilon%sigma%o%sigma\), `gold' -- as Uguccione da Pisa,
the grammarian of the twelfth century, who gives this derivation,
says, `quasi superauratus quia in superficie et extrinsecus 
videtur esse bonus, cum interius sit malus.'  See Toynbee;s 
^Dict.~, pp. 545, 546.  |egli abbaglia~: `it dazzles,' |egli~ 
meaning `the gilding,' implied in |dorate son.~  Perhaps this 
irregular use of |egli~ is an extension of the impersonal use, 
which is seen in l. 31 above, ^egli @e~; Par. xiii. 118, ^egli 
incontra~, and not infrequently elsewhere; see Blanc, ^Versuch~,
p. 211. 

	|66.  Che Federico~, &c.: `that the capes which the emperor
Frederic II used to place on criminals were light as straw in
comparison of them.'  According to the commentators, in the
punishment here referred to the victims were placed in these 
leaden capes in a boiler over a fire, and were killed by the 
melting of the lead.  In any case, however, what Dante is 
referring to is the weight of the capes. 

	|71-72.  che noi~, &c.: `that every step brought us abreast
of fresh companions.' 

	|75.  si andando~, &c.: `as we walk, cast thine eyes
around.' 

	|76.  la parola Tosca~: here, as in Inf. x. 25-7, the 
pronunciation is probably what is referred to. 

	|79.  Forse ch' avrai~: `maybe you will have'; for |forse~
used with a verbal force and followed by ^che~ cp. Purg. iv. 98;
xxi. 121. 

	|84.  la via stretta~: `the crowded way'; |stretta~ means 
`confined,' but it was so because of the multitude that crowded 
it. 

	|88.  all' atto della gola~: `from the movement of his
throat' in speaking. 

	|91.  collegio~: `assembly,' `company.' 

	|97-99.  distilla~: in the form of tears.  |sfavilla~: 
`sparkles,' i.e. clearly reveals itself. 

	|100-102.  rance~: `orange'; from a Lat. form ^aurantius.~ 
|Fan cos@i~, &c.: `make their balances (scales) thus creak'; i.e. 
make those who support the weights emit these cries. 

	|103.  Frati Godenti~: their proper name was Cavalieri di 
Santa Maria, an Order of Knighthood established under the
sanction of Urban IV in 1261, with the object of reconciling 
feuds and protecting the weak; they obtained the nickname of 
Frati Gaudenti or `Jolly Friars' because of their easy manner of
life.  The two members of the Order here named, Loderingo d' 
Andal@o and Catalano de Catalani, who were respectively a Guelf 
and a Ghibelline, were invited to Florence to exercise the office
of Podest@a conjointly, but by their hypocrisy and peculation 
they forfeited all public confidence. 

	|106-108.  un uom solingo~: i.e. the man who usually
exercised in his single person the office of Podest@a.
|Gardingo~: a quarter of Florence near the Palazzo Vecchio, where
was the palace of the Uberti, which was sacked and burnt by the 
populace during a rising against the Ghibellines in the time of 
the two Podest@as.  This was an evidence of the condition of the
city under the administration of these miscreants. 

	|109.  O frati, i vostri mali...~: `ye friars, your
misdeeds...' 

	|111.  tre pali~: these stakes ran through the two hands 
and the feet, and were used instead of nails, because they were 
fixed in the earth, there being no cross. 

	|112.  si distorse~: through indignation at being seen in
this position by a living person. 

	|115.  Quel confitto~: Caiaphas, whose hypocrisy was shown
by his giving his advice that it was expedient that one man
should die for the sins of the people; John xi. 50.  He is 
crucified in requital for Christ's death on the cross. 

	|118-120.  Attraversato~: `laid across.'  |ch' ei senta~, 
&c.: `that he should first feel the weight of every one who 
passes'; `first,' i.e. before he has passed. 

	|121-123.  il suocero~: Annas.  |si stenta~: `is tormented';
the der. is from Lat. ^abstinere~ through a form ^astentare~;
hence from the meaning of `to abstain,' ^stentarsi~ in Ital.
signifies (1) `to be in need,' (2) `to be in suffering'; Diez,
^W,ort.~, p. 403.  |mala sementa~: `the source of woes,' lit.
`evil seed.' 

	|124-125.  maravigliar~: as a heathen, he would know nothing
of the story of Christ's passion.  |disteso in croce~: stretched
in the form of a cross'; see note on l. 111. 

	|129.  alla man destra~: they were going to the left along
the ^bolgia~ (l. 68), consequently the embankment between the
sixth and seventh ^bolge~ was on their right hand.  |foce~:
`passage.' 

	|130-131.  uscirci~: for the use of |ci~ for ^di qui~ cp.
Inf. iv. 49, ^uscicci.~  |Senza costringer~, &c.: `without 
compelling the black angels to come to deliver us.'  Virgil could
require this on the strength of the divine command which
authorized him to pass through Hell, Inf. xxi. 83, 84. 

	|135-136.  Si move~: `starts,' cp. Inf. xviii. 16, 17; the
|sasso~ here is one of the ^scogli~ or `rock-bridges' mentioned
in that passage, while the |gran cerchia~ is the precipice which
encircles Malebolge.  |a questo~: sub. ^vallon~, `at this
^bolgia.~' 

	|138.  giace~: this word and |soperchia~ are contrasted,
`which slopes at the side and rises at the bottom.'  This is what
would happen with a fall of rock, the great mass of which would 
slide down into the valley.  For |giace~ meaning `slopes' cp. l.
31. 

	|140.  contava la bisogna~: `explained the matter.' 
Malacoda had told them that this bridge was standing, Inf. xxi. 
111. 

	|142-144.  Bologna~: the speaker's native place, l. 103.  It
is specially mentioned here because of its School of Theology.
|bugiardo~, &c.: cp. John viii. 44. 

	|145.  sen gi~: the introduction of the ten-syllable lines
here, which involves the loss of the weak eleventh syllable, is
perhaps due to the desire of expressing a sudden movement; see on
this the note to Inf. xxxi. 145. 

	|147.  incarcati~: burdened with the leaden capes.
