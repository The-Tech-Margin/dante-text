	|1-3.  Poich@e~, &c.: Dante here complies with the request
of the spirit who had last spoken (Inf. xiii. 139-42), in
consideration of his being a Florentine.  |ch' era gi@a fioco~: 
`who was by this time faint'; the faintness must have been
apparent in his voice, which was the only evidence that could 
show it. 

	|7-8.  nuove~: `strange.'  |una landa~: `a waste'; the 
name of the Grandes Landes, as the uncultivated district between
Bordeaux and Bayonne is called, illustrates the meaning of the 
word. 

	|11-12.  il fosso tristo~: Phlegethon; cp. Inf. xii. 52. 
|a randa a randa~: `on the very edge'; the repetition of the 
word in this and similar idioms adds precision and force to the 
statement.  |randa~ is from the Germ. ^rand~, `edge'.  K,orting,
^W,orterbuch~, No. 6646. 

	|13-15.  Lo spazzo~: `the ground.'  This word is derived, 
like ^spazio~, from Lat. ^spatium~, but bears a different 
meaning.  |Caton~: the reference is to Lucan, ^Phars.~ ix. 411 
foll., where Cato leads to Juba the remains of Pompey's army. 
The description of the barren soil in the neighbourhood of the 
Syrtis, which is here intended, is given in ll. 431-7. 

	|21.  E parea~, &c.: `it appeared that they were subject 
to different ordinances,' i.e. the punishment of each of the 
three classes who occupy this ring (see the Argument) differed in
the mode of its infliction and in the degree of its severity. 
The three lines that follow (ll. 22-4) represent respectively the
condition of the blasphemers, the usurers, and the Sodomites. 
The symbolical meaning of their different positions is thought to
be, that the defiant now ^lie impotent~, the usurers, who ^sat~ 
at their tables instead of honestly working, occupy the same 
position still, and the Sodomites, like the incontinent of the 
second Circle, ^hurry restlessly~, as they had been carried away
by want of self-command on earth. 

	|23.  raccolta~:  `drawn in,' `hunched up,' their object
being to expose the smallest possible surface to the falling 
flames. 

	|27.  Ma pi@u~, &c.: i.e. their cries of pain were louder. 

	|30.  alpe~: this word, whether it is used for `the Alps,'
or, as here, for `mountains' generally, is always singular in the
^Div. Com.~; cp. Purg. xvii. 1; xxxiii. 11 1. 

	|31.  Quali Alessandro~, &c.: the primary source of the 
story here given was the apocryphal letter of Alexander to 
Aristotle, which describes how in the course of one of his 
marches a great snowfall occurred, whereupon Alexander ordered 
his soldiers to tread down the snow; this was followed by flaming
clouds descending to the ground `tanquam faces.'  It will be seen
that Dante has represented the soldiers as trampling, not the 
snow, but the flames; this confusion however did not originate 
with him, but with Albertus Magnus, who says in his ^De Meteoris~
(i. 4. 8), a book with which Dante was acquainted, `Admirabilem 
autem impressionem scribit Alexander ad Aristotilem in epistola 
de mirabilibus Indiae dicens quemadmodum nivis nubes ignitae de 
aere cadebant, quas ipse militibus calcare praecepit'; see 
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 23, 24.  |quelle parti calde D' India~: 
`that hot region of the world, India'; this seems better than 
`that hot district of India through which Alexander's march lay,'
for the mediaevals regarded the whole of India as a hot region. 
Cp. Purg. xxvi. 21, where `Indo o Etiopo' is used as equivalent 
to `inhabitants of hot countries.' 

	|35-36.  acciocch@e~, &c.: `seeing that the flame was more
easily extinguished.'  When |acciocch@e~ is used with the indic.
(a somewhat rare use) it means `inasmuch as,' `seeing that'; cp.
^Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} 22 l. 54; {paragraph} 42. l. 20.  It
cannot possibly mean `in order that,' but the variants
^perciocch@e~ for |acciocch@e~ and ^stinguesse~ for |stingeva~ 
show that the use with the indic. was felt at an early date to 
present a difficulty.  |mentre ch' era solo~: i.e. before the 
fire caught and spread. 

	|38-39.  esca Sotto focile~: `tinder under the influence 
of the steel,' i.e. of the flint and steel used for lighting. 

	|40-42.  Senza riposo mai~ = ^senza mai riposarsi.~
|tresca~: `play' of the hands.  It was the name of a dance in 
which the hands took a prominent part.  |fresca~: `ever renewed.' 

	|44-45.  i Demon~: those at the gate of the city of Dis; 
cp. Inf. viii. 82.  |uscinci~: for ^ci uscinno~, which = ^ci 
uscirono.~  The form in -^inno~ for -^irono~ occurs again in Par.
xiv. 121, ^apparinno~; cp. ^terminonno~ for ^terminarono~, Par. 
xxviii. 105. 

	|46-48.  quel grande~: Capaneus, who when mounting the walls
of Thebes defied Jupiter, and was smitten with a thunderbolt by
him.  The story is from Statius, ^Theb.~ x. 897 foll., several
points in which passage have been adapted by Dante.  |torto~:
`frowning.'  |maturi~: `tames,' lit. `mellows,' `softens.' 

	|51-54.  Qual io fui vivo~: Stat., ^Theb.~ iii. 602,
[Capaneus] `superum contemptor.'  |il suo fabbro~: Vulcan. 
|crucciato~: `incensed' by Capaneus' menaces.  |l' ultimo di~: 
`the day of my death,' cp. Inf. xv. 47. 

	|55.  gli altri~: sc. ^fabbri~, i.e. the Cyclopes, whose
forge was fabled to be under Etna, the mediaeval and modern name
of which mountain is Mongibello. 

	|58-60.  alla pugna di Flegra~: the reference is to the 
attempt of the Giants to scale Olympus, on which occasion they 
were defeated by Jupiter; this is called by Statius (^Theb.~ x.
909) `praelia Phlegrae.'  The Phlegraean plains are generally 
identified with the peninsula of Pallene in Chalcidice, which 
faces Olympus.  |vendetta allegra~: `welcome revenge'; i.e. he 
would not be able to humiliate me or make me yield. 

	|67-69.  miglior labbia~: `calmer aspect'; for |labbia~ cp.
Inf. vii. 7; xix. 122.  |Ch' assiser Tebe~: this was the siege of
that city by the Epigoni, who supported Eteocles against his
brother Polynices. 

	|72.  assai debiti fregi~: `an amply meet garniture':
^fregio~, which means the `border' of embroidery, is here used 
ironically for `accompaniment.' 

	|74.  Ancor~: `hereafter'; cp. Par. xvii. 86. 

	|76-77.  divenimmo l@a~: `we reached the spot'; cp. Inf. 
xviii. 68.  This somewhat rare use of ^divenire~ seems to be 
derived from that of the Lat. ^devenire~ `to arrive.'
|fiumicello~: this, as we learn from ll. 130 foll., is
Phlegethon, i.e. the stream by which the waters of that river
escape from the first ring, where the violent against their
fellow men are immersed in it (Inf. xii. 47).  Emerging from the
wood of the suicides (|Fuor della selva~, it here crosses the
burning sand at right angles. 

	|79-81.  Bulicame~: this is the name of the hot mineral 
spring, which rises about two miles W. of Viterbo.  It issues 
from the top of a low hillock, and the steam which proceeds from
it can be seen from some distance off.  The water boils up from a
number of sources, and forms a pool of irregular shape some 
eighty feet in circumference, from which it is now conducted in 
different directions by five channels.  In Dante's time the 
prostitutes who lived in its neighbourhood (|le peccatrici~) were
forbidden to use the baths to which the other women resorted, and
had the water from the stream conducted to their houses.  The 
points of comparison in the simile here are the heat and the rush
of the water. 

	|83-84.  Fatt' eran pietra~: `had been turned to stone,' 
i.e. the water produced petrifactions.  |margini~: the edges,
which formed a causeway, l. 141; the |pendici~ are the banks. 
|il passo~: the way across the ring.  |lici~: arch. for ^l@i~;
cp. Purg. vii. 64. 

	|87.  sogliare~ = ^soglia~, `threshold.'  The gate here
meant is the outer gate of Hell, as contrasted with that of the 
city of Dis, which ^was~ `denied' to Virgil, as Dante had 
reminded him in l. 45. 

	|90.  ammorta~: `extinguishes'; cp. l. 142.  The flames were
quenched by the steam rising from it, Inf. xv. 2, 3. 

	|94-120.~  In this passage Virgil describes the origin of 
the rivers of Hell.  They are formed by the tears which issue 
from the figure of an old man, which stands within a cavern in 
Mount Ida in Crete. 

	|94-96.  guasto~: here and in l. 99 Dante is referring to 
the miserable condition to which Crete had been reduced by the 
Venetian domination.  |Sotto il cui rege~: in the golden age, 
when Saturn was king.  |casto~: `innocent.' 

	|97-99.  Una montagna~, &c.: the mention of Mount Ida was 
suggested by Virgil's introducing it in his account of Crete in 
^Aen.~ iii. 104-13, where `Idaeum nemus' (l. 112) corresponds to
|fronde~ here.  |vieta~: `outworn,' lit. `musty.' 

	|100-102.  Rea~: from what is here said of Rhea we gather 
that Dante had in his mind Ovid ^Fast.~ iv. 197-214, where the 
story is given of Saturn having eaten her former children by him
and how Rhea on the birth of Jupiter concealed his infant cries 
from his father by the clashing of metal.  |le grida~: i.e. the
sounds which are famous in story. 

	|103.  Dentro dal monte~: i.e. in a cavern within the 
mountain; cp. ^grotta~ in l. 114.  |un gran veglio~: the figure 
of the Old Man of Crete was suggested by the image in
Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Dan. ii. 32, by which the successive 
monarchies of the ancient world were symbolized.  Dante's figure,
however, has a wider application, and typifies the history of the
human race in its successive stages, as it passed through the 
golden, the silver, the iron age, &c.  The reason why Crete was 
chosen as the locality is, that Mount Ida was the scene of the 
golden age, though probably Dante was also influenced in his 
choice by the position of that island on the confines of the 
three continents in which the history of mankind was enacted. 
The tears which proceed from this figure are the sorrows of 
mankind arising from their sins in all ages, and by these the 
rivers of Hell are formed. 

	|104-105.  Che tien~, &c.  The figure which represents the
human race stands with its back to Damietta, i.e. the East,
because the great ancient monarchies existed in that quarter, and
looks towards Rome, because that was now the seat of the imperial
authority.  |Damiata~: Damietta is selected to represent Egypt, 
and so the East generally, because it was well known at this time
from having been twice captured by the Crusaders. 

	|108.  alla forcata~: at this point the dual power of the 
Church and the Empire commences. 

	|109-111.  eletto~: `choice.'  |salvo che~, &c.: the right 
foot is the Church, the left foot the Empire; and what is said of
the right foot, viz. that it is of baked clay, but that the
figure rests especially upon it, signifies that the Church,
though it is the more fragile of the two, has been the stronger
support to the human race. 

	|112-114.  fuor che l' oro~: no tears were shed in the golden
age, which was the age of innocence.  |fessura~: this is the
corruption and consequent suffering of the world since the Fall,
which cause men's tears to flow.  |foran quella grotta~: `force a
passage through that cavern'; |quella~ refers to l. 103, ^Dentro
dal monte.~ 

	|115.  questa valle~: the Inferno.   |si diroccia~: `falls
in cascades.' 

	|116.  Acheronte~, &c.  It is natural to suppose that Dante
had a clear conception in his own mind of the relation which the
courses of these three rivers bore to one another, but it is not
easy to determine what that conception was.  The most common view
is that they are the same stream, appearing at various points
under different names and different aspects.  If the difficulties
involved in that view -- e.g. those resulting from the changes in
the colour and the temperature of the water -- are regarded as
being too great, it may be supposed that, when the stream formed
by the combined tears (l. 114) had passed through the surface of
the earth, it divided and formed three separate rivers.  But in
that case they must have joined again before reaching the channel
at which Dante has now arrived, for it is distinctly stated in l.
117 that the waters which form them pass through it. 
|Flegetonta~: the form here is that of the Greek accus.  Dante
may have got it from the ^Culex~ (l. 271), which in his time was
regarded as a work of Virgil's, or from Servius' Commentary on
^Aen.~ vi. 265. 

	|117-120.  sen va~: ^Lor corso~ (l. 115) is the subject.
|l@a~, &c.: the lowest pit of Hell, where the water of Cocytus is
found.  |stagno~: the `Cocyti stagna alta' of Virg. ^Aen.~ vi.
323.  |non si conta~: `I give no account of it.' 

	|121-123.  Ed io~, &c.  Dante expresses surprise that he had
not seen this streamlet before.  Virgil replies (ll. 124-9) that
this was no matter for astonishment, because he had not yet made
the entire circuit of the Inferno, and therefore there must be
many objects in it which had not met his view.  |a questo
vivagno~: `at this edge (lit. selvage)' of the wood. 

	|126.  Pur a sinistra~: `constantly to the left'; cp. Inf. 
xxix. 53.  This passage is an important one as bearing on the
leftward course of the Poets through Hell; see note on Inf. ix.
132. 

	|129.  addur~, &c.: `cause a look of wonder to appear in 
thy face.' 

	|132.  l' altro~: Phlegethon, of which it is said in ll. 
115, 116 that it was formed by the fall of tears (|esta piova~). 

	|134.  il bollor~, &c.: the explanation which Virgil
suggests turns on the derivation of the name Phlegethon from Gr.
%phi%lambda%$epsilon%gamma%epsilon%iota%nu\, `to burn.'  Dante
was not himself acquainted with Greek, but he had learnt this 
from Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 550, 551 and Servius on l. 265; see 
Toynbee ^Dict.~, p. 243. 

	|136-137.  questa fossa~: the Inferno.  |L@a~: in the 
Earthly Paradise (Purg. xxviii. 130), where the soul which has 
passed through Purgatory is delivered from the recollection of 
past sins. 

	|142.  vapor~: `flame,' as in l. 35.  |si spegne~: cp. l. 
90.
