	|3.  ch, @e de' sommersi~: `which |canzone~ (or ^Cantica~)
treats of those who are plunged in Hell'; for |sommersi~ cp. Inf.
vi. 15. 

	|5.  scoperto~: `disclosed to view'; the two Poets were now
on the highest point of the bridge above; Inf. xix. 128. 

	|8-9.  al passo~, &c.: at the slow pace of a religious 
procession. 

	|13-14.  dalle reni~: `towards the reins'; for |da~ meaning
`in the direction of' cp. Inf. xxii. 146; Purg. ii. 55.  |gli~:
for ^loro.~ 

	|16.  parlasia~: old form by contraction for ^paralis@ia~,
`palsy.' 

	|19.  Se Dio ti lasci~: `so may God grant thee.' 

	|22.  la nostra imagine~: the human form. 

	|28.  piet@a~: here used in the two senses of `piety' and
`pity.'  `Here piety lives when pity is wholly dead.' 

	|30.  passion porta~: `introduces feeling where God's 
judgements are concerned,' lit. `brings feeling to bear on God's
judgement.'  There is greater MS. authority for ^passion
comporta~, and for ^compassion porta~ (see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~,
p. 326), but |passion porta~, being a less familiar expression, 
is more likely to have been altered into these than ^vice versa.~
The reading here is not affected by the question of metre, for 
Dante elsewhere uses ^passion~ both as a disyllable and a 
trisyllable; cp. Purg. xxi. 107; Inf. xxxi. 72.  The meaning of 
the passage in any case is not very different.  As regards the 
feeling displayed by Dante -- he had shown compassion to 
Francesca and others in the upper Circles of Hell, but since 
entering Malebolge he had ceased to do so; and even here the 
feeling he expresses is rather for a class of persons, and for 
the distortion of the human frame, than for individuals.  The
same is true in Inf. xxix. 1-3, where he is again overpowered by
grief. 

	|31.  a cui~: this is the soothsayer Amphiaraus, one of the
Seven against Thebes, who in the course of that expedition was
swallowed up by the earth.  Dante obtained the story from
Statius, ^Theb.~ vii. 690 foll.; viii. 1 foll.; and the words 
"|Dove rui~," &c., which are here put into the mouth of the 
Thebans, were suggested by those which Statius attributes to 
Pluto, viz. viii. 84, 85, `At tibi quos inquit, Manes, qui limite
praeceps Non licito per inane ruis?'  See Moore, ^Studies~, i. p.
246. 

	|35.  ruinare a valle~: `plunge downwards'; for |a valle~
cp. Inf. xii. 46. 

	|40.  Tiresia~: Teiresias, the Theban soothsayer, who
according to the story was changed into a woman in consequence of
his having separated two serpents with his staff, and recovered 
his sex after seven years, when he met the same serpents and 
struck them again.  The story is from Ovid, ^Met.~ iii. 320 
foll. 

	|45.  le maschili penne~: `his manly plumes,' i.e. his 
beard.  the sign of the male sex; cp. the use of ^piume~ for 
`beard' in Purg. i. 42. 

	|46-49.  Aronta~: Aruns, the Etruscan soothsayer, who
foretold the civil war between Pompey and Caesar.  Lucan, who 
tells his story (^Phars.~ i. 584 foll.), speaks of him as an 
inhabitant of Luna -- l. 586, `Aruns incoluit desertae moenia 
Lunae.'  The |monti di Luni~ are the Carrara group to the
eastward of Spezia, on the sea-face of which are the Carrara 
marble quarries (|bianchi marmi~, l. 49) and the town of the same
name.  |al ventre gli s' atterga~: `turns his back to Teiresias' 
front.' 

	|55-56.  Manto~: daughter of Teiresias.  It is noticeable
that in Purg. xxii. 113, Dante, by a slip of memory, has placed
her in Limbo.  Moreover, in the present passage he has put into
Virgil's mouth an account of the foundation of the city of
Mantua, which is different from that which Virgil himself gives
in ^Aen.~ x. 198-200; and, from what he says in ll. 97-9, it
would appear that (for what reason we know not) he desired to
correct the Virgilian legend.  In the ^Aeneid~ we are told that
Mantua was founded by Ocnus, the son of Manto and of the river
Tiber -- `Fatidicae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis, Qui muros
matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen.'  But in Dante's corrected
version Virgil is made to say that Manto was unmarried
(^vergine~, l. 82), and that she herself chose the site.  The 
latter of these statements Dante may have obtained from Isidore,
who says (^Orig.~ xv. 1. 59), `Manto Tiresiae filia post 
interitum Thebanorum dicitur delata in Italiam Mantuam 
condidisse.'  See Moore, ^Studies~ i. pp. 173-5, 304.  |cerc@o~:
intrans., `made search,' i.e. went in quest of a resting-place. 
|dove nacqu' io~: Mantua was Virgil's birthplace. 

	|59.  venne serva~, &c.: `Thebes (of which Bacchus was the
presiding deity) fell into servitude'; the reference is to its
capture by the Epigoni.  |venne~ for ^divenne~; cp. Par. xxxiii.
52. 

	|61-78.~  This passage is the most conspicuous illustration
which the poem affords of Dante's delight in physical geography,
and especially in the study of the courses of rivers.  His object
is to lead up to the site of Mantua; and in doing so he
introduces a digression, in which the basin of the Lago di Garda
is described, from the headwaters of its tributaries towards the
north, to its southern end, where the Mincio, the river of
Mantua, issues from it near Peschiera. 

	|61-63.  Suso~: `in the upper world.'  |Appi@e dell' alpe~, 
&c..: `at the foot of the Alpine chain, which forms the boundary
of Germany above Tyrol'; the mountains here intended are those 
which rise above Meran due N. of the basin of the Lago di Garda.
|alpe~, in whatever sense it is used, is always sing. in the
^Div. Com.~  |Lamagna~: ^Alamagna~ is also read; both are forms
of the Italian name of Germany.  |Tiralli~: this name was applied
both to the country of Tyrol and to the Schloss Tirol near Meran,
the hereditary seat of the Counts who ruled it; here the latter 
is probably meant, because a definite locality is pointed to. 
|Benaco~: Benacus was the Latin name of the Lago di Garda. 

	|64-66.  mille fonti~: these are the tributaries which feed
the lake; and as the town of Garda is situated on its eastern
side, and the Val Camonica lies away to the north-westward of it,
the district here described must be the upland region of the
Giudicaria to the northward of it, which has to be traversed in
passing from one of these to the other, and which contains the
principal tributaries of the lake.  |Apennino~: a few MSS. read
^Pennino~; in reality, as the preceding word ^Camonica~ ends in
^a~, the corruption either way is easy, especially as they are
proper names, and the MS. evidence does not decide much between
them.  By |Apennino~ the chain of the Apennines cannot be meant;
and though some of the commentators speak of a mountain of that
name in the neighbourhood here referred to, there is no evidence
of its existence.  Dante probably wrote ^Pennino~; for though the
Pennine Alps in the ordinary acceptation of that name -- i.e. the
range of which the Great St. Bernard is the centre -- would be
out of place here, yet Orosius assigns to them just the required
position, viz. to the south-west of Rhaetia, as the Tyrol was
called in antiquity; Oros. i. 2. 60, `Pannonia Noricus et Rhaetia
habent ab Africo (i.e. to the S. W.) Alpes Poeninas.  Dante was
probably following Orosius, who was one of his leading
authorities in geography. 

	|67-69.  nel mezzo~: in the middle of the region thus 
described.  |segnar potria~: `would be able to give his
blessing,' as bishop of the diocese; by this it is implied that 
the three dioceses met at this point.  The place intended
probably is the mouth of the river Tignalga near Campione on the
western shore of the lake, which until 1785 was the meeting-point
of the three dioceses (see Casini ^ad loc.~). 

	|70-72.  siede~: take with |Ove~, l. 72; `is situated where
the level of the surrounding country is lowest.  |arnese~:
`fortress,' lit. `harness.'  |Da fronteggiar~: `to face.'  The 
fortress of Peschiera at the southern end of the lake, which lies
between Verona on the one side and Brescia and Bergamo on the 
other, belonged at this time to the Scaligers, and was thus a 
frontier stronghold of Verona. 

	|74.  pu@o~: this line and those which rhyme with it are
ten-syllable lines.  For the justification of this exceptional 
metrical usage see note on Inf. iv. 56. 

	|76-78.  mette co~: `starts'; |co~ for ^capo~, cp. Inf. 
xxi. 64.  |Governo~: now Governolo. 

	|79.  lama~: `plain'; cp. Inf. xxxii. 96; Purg. vii. 90. 

	|82.  cruda~: `unmarried'; Statius (^Theb.~ iv. 463) calls
her `innuba Manto.' 

	|87.  vano~: `tenantless.' 

	|93.  senz' altra sorte~: `without further appealing to
augury,' Lat. ^sortes.~ 

	|94-96.  Gi@a fur~, &c.: `formerly its inhabitants were 
more numerous' than now.  |la mattia da Casalodi~: ^di~ is 
sometimes read for |da~; `before the senseless counts of Casalodi
(lit. the folly of Casalodi) were led into a trap by Pinamonte.'
Casalodi was a fortress in the territory of Brescia, from which 
the family of that name, who were the leading house in Mantua, 
were called.  Pinamonte, a citizen of Mantua, put himself forward
as a popular leader towards the end of the thirteenth century, 
and after persuading the head of the Casalodi to remove a number
of the foremost aristocrats in that city in order to appease the
people, succeeded in expelling or massacring the Casalodi 
themselves.  Dante puts this remark into Virgil's mouth merely in
order to narrate the recent history of Mantua. 

	|97.  t' assenno~: `I counsel thee'; on Virgil's remark here
see note on l. 55. 

	|105.  rifiede~: `reverts to,' lit. `strikes upon afresh';
from ^rifedire.~ 

	|108-110.  quando~: the time of the Trojan war is meant.  |Si
che~, &c.: `so that hardly enough men remained to beget
children,' lit. `for the cradles' (Lat. ^cunae~), i.e. for the 
supply of children.  |diede il punto~: `announced the moment.' 

	|112.  cosi il canta~: Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 114-9.  In that
passage we are told that Eurypylus was sent to consult the oracle
of Apollo concerning the return of the Greeks from Troy, but 
nothing is said about his having given the signal for starting 
from Aulis.  Dante seems by a slip of memory to have confused the
two occasions. 

	|113.  Tragedia~: the Aeneid is called a tragedy, because of
its elevated subject and style; cp. ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 4. ll.
38, 39, `per tragoediam superiorem stilum induimus.'  The word
|Tragedia~, like ^commed@ia~ in Inf. xvi. 128, is accented on the
penultima contrary to the modern Italian usage.  |alcun loco~: `a
certain passage'; for ^alcuno~ in this sense, where the thing
meant is not named, cp. Purg. iv. 80, ^alcun' arte.~  The 
indefinite manner of reference is here used in default of any 
more exact mode of quotation which a poet can employ. 

	|115-116.  ne' fianchi~, &c.: unless this is a description
which was current at the time, we must suppose that it refers to
the emaciated appearance of a recluse student.  |Michele Scotto~:
Michael Scott (^circ.~ 1190-1250), who was reputed to be a
wizard, was a native of Scotland, and studied in Oxford and
Paris, and lived for some time at the court of Frederic II.  He
translated several of Aristotle's works into Latin from the
Arabic. 

	|118-119.  Guido Bonatti~: an astrologer of Forl@i
patronized by Count Guido da Montefeltro.  |Asdente~: a shoemaker
of Parma who professed himself a prophet.  |avere inteso~, &c.: 
`to have given his attention to his leather and his thread,' 
instead of meddling with prophecy. 

	|123.  imago~: an effigy of the person who is as intended to
be influenced by charms; cp. Virg. ^Ecl.~ viii. 75. 

	|124-126.  tiene~, &c.: the general meaning of the passage 
is -- `the moon is setting,' and this is used in place of "the 
sun is rising,' because the mention of the name of that luminary
is avoided in Hell.  The time intended is about 6 a.m. on Easter
Eve.  |il confine~, &c.: the boundary line of the two
hemispheres, of which Jerusalem and the Mountain of Purgatory 
were the two central points, and the Ganges and the west of Spain
-- here represented by Seville -- the extremities; see note on 
Purg. ii. 1.  |Sotto~: by `below' is here meant `beyond,' `on the
further side of Seville.'  The moon was now setting in the
northern hemisphere.  |Caino e le spine~: the Man in the Moon,
here used for the moon itself.  The bundle of thorns, which, 
according to the story, Cain was condemned to carry, probably 
represents his offering of the fruit of the ground which was not
accepted. 

	|127.  iernotte~: `yesternight,' i.e. the night before last,
it being now early morning.  The moon was full on the night which
Dante had passed in the ^Selva~, as is implied in the next two
lines, and that was the night between Holy Thursday and Good
Friday; see note on Inf. ii. 1. 

	|129.  Alcuna volta~: `on a certain occasion,' i.e. on an
occasion which I do not name, but which you may remember; cp.
^alcun loco~ above, l. 113.  |fonda~: abbreviated for ^profonda.~ 

	|130.  introcque~: `meanwhile,' an archaic word = ^intanto.~
