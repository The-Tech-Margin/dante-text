	|1-3.  Dal centro~, &c.: after St. Thomas is silent Beatrice
commences speaking; and as she is with Dante at the centre of the
circle of spirits among whom is St. Thomas, the movement of their
voices in opposite directions is compared to the waving motion of
water in a bowl, which moves outward or inward according as it
receives an impulse from within or from without. 

	|4-6.  caso~: for ^caduta~; `of a sudden dropped into my
mind.'  |vita~: `spirit.' 

	|7-8.  Per la~, &c.: `owing to the resemblance to which his
and Beatrice's discourse gave birth.' 

	|10-12.  e nol~, &c.: `though he tells it not to you.'  |n@e
pensando ancora~: Beatrice perceives the thought, which was
forming, but had not yet come to the birth, in Dante's mind.  The
thought related to the nature of the glorified body after the
resurrection, concerning which the questions arose, (1) Would the
bodies of the saints be luminous? (2) If so, could their eyes 
endure so brilliant a light? 

	|13-14.  onde~, &c.: `which emanates from your substance,'
lit. `with which your substance blossoms': the `substance' or
`essence' is the spirit. 

	|18.  ch' al veder~, &c.: `that the sight of it should not
harm you,' lit. `that it should not harm you at the sight of it.'

	|19-21.  pinti e tratti~: these words describe how, in
moving round in a ring, each dancer impels the one before him, 
and draws the one that follows him.  |Alla fiata~: `all at once,'
`all together'; Fr. ^@a la fois.~  |vanno a rota~: `are dancing 
in a round'; |rota~, like `round' in Engl., was a kind of dance;
Benvenuto says, `faciunt tripudium, quod appellatur rota more 
romano.' 

	|25-27.  Qual~, &c.: `he that laments because death in this
world is the condition of living in the world above (lit. because
one must die here, in order to, &c.), has not seen there (|quive~
for ^quivi~, in Heaven) the refreshment of the eternal rain,'
i.e. the quickening influence of the love which proceeds from
God.  Otherwise expressed, the meaning is: -- `No one who has
been a spectator of the joys of Heaven could lament that death is
the condition,' &c. 

	|28.  Quell' uno~, &c.: their song is of the Trinity in 
Unity.  |due~ signifies the Father and the Son, from whom the 
Holy Spirit proceeds; from this point of view they are regarded 
apart from him. 

	|33.  giusto muno~: `full recompense'; |muno~ is Lat.
^munus.~ 

	|34-36.  luce pi@u dia~: the spirit of Solomon; cp. Par. x.
109, where it is called `luce pi@u bella.'  This was in the inner
ring of spirits (|minor cerchio~), which first appeared to Dante.

|fu~: at the Annunciation. 

	|39.  cotal vesta~: the envelopment of light: `our love will
radiate around us such a vesture.' 

	|40-42.  La sua~, &c.: `the brightness of our garb of light
will correspond to the fervour of our love, and that to our power
of seeing God, and that power is in proportion to the free grace
which is bestowed on each in addition to his natural gifts.'  For
|seguir@a~ some read ^seguita.~  |Quanta~ is for ^Quanto~,
attracted to the gender of |grazia.~ 

	|43-45.  Come~: `when.'  |Pi@u grata~: `more acceptable to 
God.'  |tutta e quanta~: `complete.' 

	|46-51.  Per che~, &c.: the order of statement which is 
followed in ll. 40-2 is here inverted. `Owing to this (viz. to
our persons being more acceptable to God) God's gift of free
grace (|gratuito lume~), which renders us capable of seeing Him,
will be increased; and consequently our vision of Him must
increase, and with it the fervour of love which is kindled by it,
and the brightness of our enveloping light which proceeds from 
that fervour.' 

	|52-54.  Ma si~, &c.: `but, just as is the case with (a
live) coal which sends forth flame, yet through the intensity of
its brightness so far overpowers it, that it maintains its own 
appearance,' i.e. is clearly visible in the midst of the flame. 

	|56-57.  in apparenza~: `in the clearness of its aspect,'
lit. `visibility.'  |Che tutto di~, &c.: `which (now) the earth
doth ever hide.' 

	|59-60.  saran forti~, &c.: `will avail for (i.e. will be
strong enoigh to bear) every object that can give us pleasure.' 
This is the answer to the second question, which is stated in ll.
16-8. 

	|62-63.  l' uno e l' altro coro~: the two circles of saints.

|Amme~: `Amen.'  |disio~: `desire to regain.' 

	|64-66.  per le mamme~, &c.: for their relations and
friends, that they also might win the full measure of heavenly 
bliss.  |Anzi che~, &c.: `before they (the spirits in this 
Heaven) became eternal flames.' 

	|67-68.  di chiarezza pari~: `equal in brightness to what
was already seen.'  If any difficulty is found in reconciling
this with what Dante says in ll. 76-8 of his eyes being
overpowered by this new apparition, which had not been the case
with the former ones, |pari~ may be explained as `equally
brilliant in all its parts.'  |sopra~: `in addition to.' 

	|71-72.  Comincian~, &c.: `new objects begin to appear in
the sky, so that the sight seems real, and yet unreal.'  The
stars peep out, disappearing and reappearing. 

	|73-74.  Parvemi~, &c.: `methought I began to see': for this
impersonal use of ^parere~ with the infin. cp. Purg. xv. 85, `mi
parve esser tratto.'  |sussistenze~: `spirits'; see note on Par.
xiii. 59.  The revelation of numerous other spirits, which form a
third ring outside the other two, seems to be intended to show
that the 24 saints who have hitherto appeared are only the more
conspicuous occupants of this Heaven. 

	|80-81.  tra quelle~, &c.: `her appearance must be left 
undescribed as one of those sights which have passed out of my 
mind'; cp. Par. i. 9.  |seguir~: for ^seguirono.~ 

	|82-84.  Quindi~: from the sight of Beatrice.  |salute~: 
`blessedness.' 

	|86-87.  stella~: the fiery planet, Mars, which Dante and 
Beatrice now enter.  |che l' usato~: `than its wont,' i.e. than 
what we on earth are wont to see it to be. 

	|88.  quella favella~, &c.: the language of the heart, 
not expressed in words, which is common to all mankind. 

	|93.  Esso litare~: `this offering of mine'; |litare~ is
Lat. for `to sacrifice.' 

	|94-96.  Ch@e con tanto~, &c.: `for splendours appeared to 
me so luminous (|con tanto lucore~) and so ruddy within two 
rays.'  The spirits are grouped in two luminous stripes or bands,
which are placed transversely to one another, so as to form a 
cross.  |robbi~: from adj. ^robbio~ (Lat. ^rubeus~), `ruddy.'  |O
Elios~, &c.: `O Sun, who dost thus adorn them.'  The name of the
sun in Greek (Helios), and its fancied derivation from the Hebrew
^Eli~, which would justify Dante in using it in addressing God, 
may have been known to hini from the ^Magnae Derivationes~ of 
Uguccione da Pisa, where it is said, `Ab ^ely~, quod est deus, 
dictus est sol ^elyos~, quod pro deo olim reputabatur.'  See 
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 213. 

	|97-99.  Come~, &c.: the points in respect of which the 
Milky Way is compared to the cross in Mars are, that the stars 
which compose it form a band of light, and (especially) that they
vary in magnitude.  |distinta~, &c.: `variegated by greater and 
lesser lights.'  |che fa~, &c.: `that it causes men exceedingly 
wise to doubt.'  The doubts here referred to relate to the nature
of the Milky Way; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 15. ll. 45-7, `Perch@e @e da
sapere che di quella Galassia li filosofi hanno avuto diverse 
opinioni'; see also Ar. ^Meteorol.~ i. 8.

	|100-102.  Si costellati~, &c.: `with lights thus grouped
(the greater with the lesser) did those two rays (bands) form in
the depths of Mars the venerable sign (the Cross), which
quadrants joining in a circle make.'  The quadrants are the four
equal parts into which the area enclosed by a circle can be
divided; and the |giunture~ are the meeting-points of these --
or, in other words, two diameters of the circle, intersecting
|one~ another at right angles.  The cross in this case is the
Greek cross, the limbs of which are equal. 

	|103-105.  Qui vince~, &c.: `here my memory overcomes my 
genius (i.e. I remember what I saw, but it defies my power of 
description); for that cross beamed forth Christ in such a
manner, that I can find nothing adequate to illustrate it.' 
|CRISTO~: for the uniform rhyme cp. Par. xii. 71-5. 

	|106-108.  Ma chi~, &c.: `but the man who takes up his cross
and follows Christ will hereafter (in the future life) pardon me
for my omission, when he sees Christ shine forth in the
brightness of that cross (|in quell' albor~).'  In the figure of
the cross in Mars Christ crucified is shown forth and reproduced
in the lives of Crusaders (i.e. those who bore the badge of the 
Cross), and of martyrs and others, who in the metaphorical sense
conspicuously bore the cross after Him.  Dante, being incapable 
of describing this figure himself, holds out to his readers the 
hope of seeing Christ crucified thus revealed in it, if they in 
like manner observe Christ's injunction to take up their cross 
and follow Him, and thus win eternal life.  For |ancor~ in the 
sense of `hereafter' cp. Purg. viii. 75; Par. xvii. 86.  |lasso~:
for ^lascio.~ 

	|109-111.  Di corno~, &c.: `from one arm of the cross to the
other, and from the summit to the base.'  |lumi~: the spirits
within the cross.  |nel congiungersi~, &c.: `as they met and 
passed one another'; they then `sparkled' from mutual love. 

	|112-117.  Cosi~, &c.: the movement of these spirits within
the limbs of the cross is compared to that of motes in a sunbeam
seen in a darkened room.  `In like manner here on earth motes of 
all sizes (lit. the particles of bodies, long and short) are seen
to move -- level and aslant, swiftly and slowly, changing their 
appearance -- within a ray of light, wherewith at times the shade
is streaked, which to ward off the sun men contrive for 
themselves with cunning art,' i.e. by blinds, shutters, &c.  The
correspondence between these lines and the description of the
same objects which is given in Lucretius, ii. 113 foll. --
especially in the words |Le minuzie dei corpi~ when compared with
ll. 116, 117, `Multa minuta modis multis per inane videbis
Corpora misceri radiorum lumine in ipso' -- is too strongly
marked to be the result of accident.  Since, however, Dante
appears to have been othervise unacquainted with Lucretius' poem,
it seems likely that he got this passage at second hand.  See 
Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 295. 

	|118-120.  giga~: `violin'; Germ. ^Geige.~  |in tempra~,
&c.: `tuned in harmony with many strings.'  |tintinno~:
`tinkling,' i.e. an indefinite melodious sound.  |la nota~: 
`the tune.' 

	|121-123.  apparinno~: for ^apparirono~; cp. ^uscinci~ for 
^ci uscinno~ (= ^uscirono~) in Inf. xiv. 45.  |S' accogliea~: 
`there gathered,' the sounds combining.  |rapiva~: `enraptured.'
125, 126.  |Risurgi e vinci~: these words are addressed to
Christ, whom the warrior spirits in Mars are specially 
represented as celebrating as a conqueror.  They appear to be a 
fragment of a hymn.  |che non~, &c.: `who, though he hears, does
not understand.' 

	|129.  vinci~: `bonds,' for ^vinchi.~ 

	|131.  Posponendo~, &c.: `because I account less even the 
joy of seeing Beatrice's eyes.' 

	|133-139.  Ma chi~, &c.: `but he who bethinks him that the 
quickening seals of every form of beauty (the planetary spheres)
work with greater force as they ascend (i.e. cause more delight 
according as they are higher), and that I had not there (in the 
Heaven of Mars) turned towards them (the eyes of Beatrice, l. 
131), may excuse me for that whereof I accuse myself in order to
exculpate myself, and may see that I speak the truth, because the
holy joy (of Beatrice's eyes) is not ignored (|dischiuso~) in
what I say (|qui~), since their beauty is intensified (|si fa
pi@u sincero~) as she rises from sphere to sphere.'  Dante here 
justifies himself for having said that the melody which he had 
just heard delighted him more than anything he had hitherto met 
with in Paradise, by doing which he had assigned the second place
to the joy of seeing Beatrice's eyes.  In order to justify
himself (|Per escusarmi~), he accuses himself of not having
looked at Beatrice's eyes since his arrival in the Heaven of Mars
(l. 135); and his excuse for this (|Escusar puommi~) is that he 
was attracted by the delights of that Heaven, which surpassed 
those of the previous Heavens, according to the system of
Paradise, in which the beauty and joy increase in ascending from
sphere to sphere (ll. 133, 134).  Consequently, what he had said
about the delight of the melody of this Heaven surpassing all 
previous delights was true, inasmuch as it is reconcilable with 
the superior attractions of Beatrice's eyes, for their beauty had
increased since the Heaven of Mars had been reached, but Dante 
was not aware of this because he had not seen them (ll. 138,
139); cp. Par. xv. 32, 33.  |i vivi suggelli~, &c.: the planetary
spheres are called `the quickening seals of every form of
beauty,' because it is by their impress, as exercised by the 
Intelligences, that the order of Nature is regulated. 
|dischiuso~: lit. `excluded'; for this meaning of the word cp. 
Par. vii. 102.
