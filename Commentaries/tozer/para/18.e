	|1-3.  Gi@a si godeva~, &c.: `now was that blessed mirror
(of God's countenance) enjoying by himself (i.e. in the solitude
of silence) his own thought, while I was tasting (i.e. ruminating
on) mine,' i.e. that which I had heard concerning myself. 
According to this interpretation, |verbo~ is to be taken in the
Scholastic sense of the term -- as Aquinas says, `Primo et
principaliter interior mentis conceptus verbum dicitur' (^Summa~,
i. Q. 34. Art. 1).  The `thought' here is the contemplation of 
the Divine mind, and this suits the expression |specchio~ which 
is used of Cacciaguida.  Others take |verbo~ in its ordinary 
sense, the meaning being that Cacciaguida was rejoicing in what 
he had said to Dante.  But it is harsh to represent the Poet's 
ancestor as rejoicing in his predictions of impending sorrow, so
that the former interpretation presents the lesser difficulty. 

	|5-6.  ch' io sono~, &c.: `that I (who am thy
representative) stand in the presence of God, who lightens the 
burden of every wrong.' 

	|9.  abbandono~: `I relinquish the task of describing.' 

	|10-11.  pur~: `merely.'  |reddire~: archaic form of
^riedere~; cp. Par. xi. 105; `return upon itself,' i.e. recall
its impressions; cp. Par. i. 9, `retro la memoria non pu@o ire.' 

	|13.  Tanto~: `only this'; cp. Par. ii. 67. 

	|16-18.  Fin che~: `while.' (N.B.  Some editors remove the
full stop from the end of the preceding line, and introduce it
after ^aspetto~, l. 18.)  |col secondo aspetto~: `with its 
reflected aspect.'  The eternal pleasure (the light of God's 
countenance), which shone immediately on Beatrice, was reflected
from her face into Dante's eyes. 

	|20-21.  Volgiti~: towards Cacciaguida, who was about to 
speak again.  |non pur~, &c.: the symbolical meaning is, that 
theological contemplation is not sufficient to produce heavenly 
joy without the study of heroic deeds, which are represented by 
Cacciaguida and the other occupants of this sphere. 

	|24.  tolta~: `absorbed.' 

	|28-30.  Ei cominci#o~: Cacciaguida now proceeds to point 
out to Dante some of the most illustrious spirits in Mars. 
|quinta soglia~, &c.: the planet Mars, the fifth grade in the 
system of the Heavens in Paradise, the life of which proceeds 
from its highest point (|che vive della cima~), the presence of 
God in the Empyrean.  For |soglia~ cp.  Par. xxxii. 13.  
|frutta~, &c.: i.e. is always receiving accessions to its
numbers, and never loses any. 

	|32-33.  di gran voce~, &c.: `of great fame, such as would
furnish a noble subject for the greatest poet.' 

	|34-36.  nei corni~, &c.: the spirits, as they are named,
flash across from one arm of the cross to the other.  |far@a l' 
atto~: lit. `will perform the action'; `will do what lightning 
does in the cloud from which it proceeds.' 

	|38.  com' ei si feo~: `even as it was done,' i.e. as soon
as the name was pronounced.  |ei~ = |il nomar.~ 

	|40-42.  Maccabeo~: Judas Maccabeus.  |era ferza del paleo~:
`was the whip to the top,' i.e. was the impulse which caused the
rotation.  The homely simile is borrowed from Virg. ^Aen.~ vii.
378-84, where it is applied to Amata's wild excitement when under
the influence of the Fury. 

	|43-45.  Cosi~, &c.: `similarly my watchful look followed
two such lights, corresponding to Charlemagne and Roland, even as
the hunter's eye follows his falcon in its flight.'  |volando~: 
here used for ^volante.~ 

	|46-48.  Guglielmo~: William Count of Orange in Provence,
who lived in the age of Charlemagne; he fought against the
Saracens, when they made inroads into the South of France.
|Rinoardo~: Renouard was a Saracen by birth, who became a
companion in arms of William: both died as monks.  |Gottifredi~:
Godfrey of Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade.  |Roberto
Guiscardo~: the leader of the Normans in South Italy in Cent.
xi., who founded the kingdom of Naples, and became Duke of Apulia
and Calabria.  He is mentioned because he expelled the Saracens 
from Italy. 

	|49-51.  Indi~, &c.: the spirit of Cacciaguida now resumes
its place among the other spirits in the Cross, and takes part in
their singing.  `Then, departing and taking its station among the
other luminaries, the spirit that had spoken to me displayed to
me his skill among the heavenly choir.'

	|52~ foll.  Dante and Beatrice now ascend to the sixth
Heaven, or Heaven of Jupiter.  In this are found the spirits of
those who were pre-eminent in justice; and the Empire, which was
to Dante the embodiment of the spirit of justice, is here
glorified by the spirits grouping themselves in the form of the
Imperial eagle. 

	|53-54.  il mio dovere~: `what I ought to do.'  |atto~: 
`gesture.' 

	|57.  Vinceva~, &c.: `surpassed its former, and even its
latest wont,' i.e. her appearance when I last saw her.  |gli
altri~ agrees with ^soleri~ understood, that being the plural of
the infin. ^solere~ used substantively.  |ultimo~ refers to what
is described in ll. 7-12. 

	|58-60.  E come~, &c.: the point of the comparison is, that
in both cases the change to a higher condition is not traceable
in itself, but is revealed by other signs.  |per sentir~, &c.:
`through increased sense of pleasure in good works.' 

	|61-63.  che il mio~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `that I had 
reached a sphere of wider revolution,' i.e. a higher sphere, 
because in ascending each sphere described a larger circle than 
the preceding one: lit. `that my circular movement, as I was 
borne along with the heavens, had increased its circumference.' 
|veggendo~, &c.: `by seeing that marvel of beauty more glorious 
still.' 

	|64.  E quale~, &c.: the sudden change from the ruddy light
of the planet Mars to the clear whiteness of Jupiter is compared
to the rapid disappearance of the blush of shame on a lady's face
when it resumes its natural colour. 

	|67-68.  Tal fu~: understand ^il trasmutare~: `such was the
change which I beheld (|negli occhi miei~), when I had turned 
away, from Beatrice to regard it.  |temprata~: both this 
characteristic of Jupiter and the whiteness of its light are 
noticed by Dante in ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 198-204, `Tolommeo 
dice....che Giove @e stella di temperata complessione, in mezzo 
della freddura di Saturno e del calore di Marte...Intra tutte le
stelle bianca si mostra, quasi argentata.' 

	|70-72.  Io vidi~, &c.: `I saw within that torch of Jove
(i.e. in the bright planet) the sparkling of the love that it 
contained (i.e. the glad spirits) delineate before my eyes our 
letters.'  This is explained in ll. 77, 78.  |favella~ stands for
the alphabet, by which language is represented. 

	|73-74.  E come~, &c.: for the comparison see Lucan, v.
711-6, where it is said of the cranes, Effingunt
varias...figuras.'  Observe how the natural motion of the birds 
in the simile modifies the impression of mechanical movement, 
which might otherwise attach to the formation of the letters by 
the spirits.  |congratulando~: for ^congratulandosi~, `expressing
their mutual pleasure in,' &c. 

	|76-78.  dentro ai lumi~: `enveloped in those lights.' |Or
D, or I, or L~: cp. l. 91, from which we see that these are the 
first three letters of the word ^Diligite.~ 

	|79.  a sua nota moviensi~: `they followed their music in
their movements.' 

	|82-84.  O diva Pegasea~: the Pegasean goddess is the Muse,
so called because the Muses were associated with the fountain of
Hippocrene, which rose when the rock was smitten by the hoof of
Pegasus, the winged horse of Bellerophon.  |Ed essi~, &c.: `while
they (|gl' ingegni~) by thy aid (dignify and immortalize) cities
and realms.' 

	|85-87.  rilevi~: `describe,' lit. `represent in relief.' 
|brevi~: `scant,' i.e. inadequate to the task. 

	|88-90.  Mostrarsi~, &c.: `the saintly beings (l. 76)
displayed themselves in thirty-five vowels and consonants.'  This
is the number of the letters in the Latin sentence which follows.
|parti~: i.e. letters syllables, and words.  |si come~, &c.:
`even as they seemed to me to be denoted.' 

	|91-93.  Diligite iustitiam~: these are the first words of
the Book of Wisdom, `Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the
earth.'  |primai~, &c.: `were the first verb and noun of all that
was depicted.'  |sezzai~: `last'; archaic word from Lat.
^secius~, Diez, p. 400; cp. ^al dassezzo~, `at last,' Inf. vii.
130.  

	|94-96.  M~: pronounced ^emme.~  The band of spirits group 
themselves into the form of the letters, representing them 
successively one by one; when they have formed the last letter of
all, they retain its form for a while.  Mr. Gardner suggests as 
a reason for this (^Dante's Ten Heavens~ p. 132), that the M of 
^terram~ stands for the initial letter of ^Monarchia.~ 
|argento~, &c.: `a pattern of gold on a field of silver.'  

	|99.  il ben~, &c.: the Divine Justice, embodied in this 
planet, to which they are now attracted from their place in the 
empyrean Heaven. 

	|102.  gli stolti~: `simple folk.'  There was an old
superstition, according to which the country people were wont to
divine from the sparks which proceeded from two burning sticks 
struck together, such things as the number of years they had to 
live, the number of pieces of gold which were in prospect for 
them, &c. 

	|103-105.  quindi~: from the summit of the M.  |Si come~,
&c.: `even as the Sun who kindles them (God) ordained for them,'
i.e. according to the height of glory which God appointed for 
them. 

	|107-108.  aquila~: there are two stages in the
transformation by which the eagle is portrayed.  First, the newly
arrived band of spirits, which had rested on the top of the M, 
group themselves anew in that position, so as to form the eagle's
head and neck; afterwards, the former band, which had represented
the M, transforms itself into the body and wings of that bird 
(cp. ll. 112-4).  |Rappresentare~, &c.: `represented by that 
inlaid fire'; for the meaning of |distinto~ cp. ll. 95, 96.  On 
the use of the prep. |a~ see note on Purg. viii. 106. 

	|109-111.~  These three lines are intended to answer the 
question which arises in the reader's mind, What was the agency 
which grouped these spirits into the figure of the eagle?  The 
answer is -- the immediate action of the Mind of God, who is also
the Author of Nature.  |Quei~, &c.: paraphrase thus: -- God by 
whom this figure is formed, has no need, like human artists, to 
follow nature, but himself guides nature; this He does by the 
agency of His creative and formative power, which manifests
itself in the processes of life e.g. in birds building their
nests.  |e da lui~, &c.: `and we recognize (|si rammenta~) as 
proceeding from Him (|da lui~) that power which is the formative 
instinct (|forma~) by which birds build their nests.' 

	|112-114.  beatitudo~: `saintly band' the abstract being
used for the concrete; the word is from the Latin.  |ingigliarsi
all' emme~: `to take the shape of the lily (^fleur-de-lys~) in 
forming the M.'  The Gothic M closely resembles that flower; see
the figures in Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 42.  |Con poco moto~, &c.: 
`with alight change of position followed out the figure,' i.e.
completed the shape of the eagle by forming the body and wings. 
The resemblance of the ^fleur-de-lys~ to the body and wings of 
the eagle enabled them to do this with slight movement. 

	|115-136.~  The sight of the eagle as the emblem of justice
affords Dante an opportunity of glorifying the Empire, of which
it was the symbol, and of denouncing the corruptions of the
Papacy, which were the greatest obstacles in the way of justice. 

	|115-117.  stella~: Jupiter.  |che nostra~, &c.: `that our 
justice (on earth) is derived from that Heaven (i.e. the sixth 
Heaven) of which thou art the jewel (i.e. which thou dost
adorn).'  The Imperial eagle, which to Dante was the
representative of justice on earth, is figured in that sphere of
Heaven in which the glory of justice is set forth. 

	|120.  Ond' esce~, &c.: `What is the source of the smoke
which dulls thy ray,' i.e. `whence arise the impediments which 
oppose the administration of justice.'  These, he goes on to say,
proceed from the corruptions of the Papal court. 

	|121-123.  un' altra flata~: as Christ had done before, when
he drove the money-changers out of the Temple.  |templo~: here
the Church.  |si mur@o~: `was built up,' `founded on.'  |di
sangue e di martiri~ may be either `on the deaths and sufferings
of martyrs,' or `on the blood of Christ and the sufferings of
martyrs.'  If ^segni~ is read, for which there is much MS.
evidence, it means `miracles.' 

	|124-126.  milizia del ciel~: `heavenly host'; the saints in
the Heaven of Jupiter.  |cu' io contemplo~: `on whom my thoughts
are fixed.'  Dante is writing on earth, and addresses the saints
from that point of view.  |malo esemplo~: that of the pastors of
the Church. 

	|128-129.  togliendo~: by excommunications, which `deprive
sometimes one sometimes another, of the spiritual nutriment which
God the merciful Father, denies to none.' 

	|130.  tu~: as Dante here speaks from the point of view of
the time at which he was writing, this must refer to John XXII 
(Pope from 1316-34), who was continually making and revoking 
excommunications. 

	|134-136.  colui~: St. John the Baptist, the dweller in the 
wilderness, whose death was caused by the dancing of Herodias' 
daughter (|per salti~).  By the Baptist is here meant his figure 
on the golden florins; the object of the Pope's desire was lucre.
As it was on the Florentine coins that the figure of the Baptist
was stamped, and John XXII was Pope at Avignon, the remark here 
does not at first sight seem applicable to him; but Villani tells
us (ix. 171) that this Pope coined gold florins in imitation of 
those of Florence.  |il Pescator n@e Polo~: `neither Peter (the 
fisherman) nor Paul.'  The familiarity implied in the term |il 
Pescator~ and the form |Polo~ is intended to be depreciative.
