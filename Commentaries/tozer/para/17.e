	|1-6.  Dante makes inquiry from his forefather about the
circumstances of the remainder of his own life on earth.  In this
respect he compares himself to Pha,ethon, who, when Epaphus
denied that he was the son of Phoebus, questioned his mother 
Clymene on this subject.  The story is told in Ov. ^Met~: i. 748
foll. 

	|3.  a' figli scarsi~: `chary towards their sons,' i.e.
unwilling to grant their requests.  This was the moral of the
story of Pha,ethon, who persuaded his father, the Sun, to allow
him to drive his chariot, the results of which proceeding were 
disastrous. 

	|4-6.  era sentito~: `I was perceived to be.'  |mutato
sito~: Cacciaguida had descended from his proper station in the 
Cross in Mars; cp. Par. xv. 19-21.

	|7.  Manda fuor~, &c.: `give vent to the eagerness.' 

	|12.  ti mesca~: `may mingle the cup (i.e. prepare the
reply) for thee.' 

	|13-18.  piota~: lit. `turf,' `sod'; `plot of ground from 
which I sprang,' cp. ^radice~ in Par. xv. 89.  Some read
^pianta~, `tree,' `stock,' but this is evidently ^facilior
lectio.~  |s@i t' insusi~, &c.: `art so exalted, that thou dost 
see contingent things (the occurrences of human life) even before
they actually happen, with absolute mathematical certainty.' 
|Non capere~: `are inadmissible'; cp. Purg. xxi. 81 and note;
Par. iii. 76: `that it is impossible for a triangle to have two
obtuse angles.'  |il punto~: the face of God. 

	|19-21.  Mentre~, &c.: Dante's anxiety concerning his future
fortunes had been aroused by intimations made to him both in
Purgatory and in Hell; in the former by Corrado Malaspina (Purg.
viii. 133-9) and Oderisi d' Agobbio (Purg. xi. 140, 141); in the
latter by Farinata (Inf. x. 79-81) and Brunetto Latini (Inf. xv.
61-4). 

	|24.  tetragono~, &c.: `foursquare to meet the strokes of
fate,' the reference being to the solidity of a square figure. 
The word |tetragono~ is from Ar. ^Eth. Nic.~ i. 11. 11,
%tau%epsilon%tau%rho%alpha%gamma%omega%nu%omicron%sigma\
%alpha%nu%epsilon%upsilon\ %psi%omicron%gamma%omicron%upsilon\,
where it is used, as here, of a person bearing good and evil
fortune; it is reproduced in the Lat. version of Aristotle, and
from this Dante obtained it. 

	|27.  pi@u lenta~: `with less sudden blow.' 

	|29-30.  come volle~, &c.: cp. l. 7.  After Dante's
interview with Farinata, Virgil had intimated to him that 
Beatrice would give him information as to what was to befall him
(Inf. x. 130-2); and Dante himself declared to Brunetto Latini 
that he was looking forward to this (Inf. xv. 88-90).  When it 
comes to the point, Beatrice allows Cacciaguida to make the 
revelation. 

	|31-32.  ambage~, &c.: `ambiguous oracles, in which the 
foolish folk (the heathen) in days of yore ensnared themselves.' 

	|35-36.  Latin~: `style,' `language'; cp. Par. x. 120; xii.
144.  |Chiuso~, &c.: `concealed (by the enveloping light) and
revealing himself by (the brightness of) his own smile.' 

	|37-38.  La contingenza~, &c.: `contingency (i.e. casual
occurrences), which does not extend beyond the volume of your
material world.'  By `volume' here is meant the combined total of
the objects which make up the universe.  For a similar form of
expression cp.  Par. xxxiii. 85-7. 

	|40-42.  Necessit@a~, &c.: this is intended to guard the 
freedom of the human will, which is not affected by the 
foreknowledge of God.  `Yet contingent events are not rendered 
necessary by God's prescience, any more than the movement of a 
ship down stream is determined by the eye in which it is 
reflected.'  The illustration is singularly felicitous.  For |Se
non come~ cp. Par. i. 137. 

	|43-44.  Da indi~: from the ^cospetto eterno.~  |come
viene~, &c.: the comparison is intended to express harmonious 
impression gradually stealing over the soul. 

	|46.  Ippolito~: the point of the comparison is that, as 
Hippolytus was driven from Athens by the false accusations of his
step-mother Phaedra, so would Dante be from Florence.  The story
of Hippolytus is from Ov. ^Met.~ xv. 497-505. 

	|50-51.  a chi~, &c.: `by him who is devising it, in that
place where Christ is daily bought and sold.'  The place is Rome,
where there is a traffic in Church dignities; and the person
referred to is Boniface VIII, with whom the Black Guelfs
intrigued with the view of introducing Charles of Valois into 
Florence, and who was strongly inimical to Dante on account of
his opposition to Charles during his Priorate in 1300. 

	|52-54.  La colpa~, &c.: `the blame will be attributed by
the popular cry, as usual, to the wronged party,' i.e. to the
White Guelfs, who were expelled with Dante from Florence.  |la 
vendetta~, &c.: `the punishment that shall follow will give 
evidence that it is God's unerring judgement (|il vero~) which 
dispenses it.'  It will do this by falling on the guilty parties.
The subsequent misfortunes in which Florence was involved are 
here referred to. 

	|55.  ogni cosa diletta~: i.e. family, friends, and country.

	|58-59.  come sa~, &c.: `how bitter is the taste of
another's bread.'  Dante is referring to his dependence on the 
hospitality of others during his exile. 

	|62-63.  la compagnia~, &c.: the company of his fellow- 
exiles, such as Lapo Salterello, of whom Benvenuto (on Par. xv. 
128) says that he was very annoying to Dante during his exile. 
|valle~: the Vale of Misery. 

	|66.  n' avr@a~, &c.: `shall blush with shame for it.'  |la
tempia~ is here used in the sing. for the ordinary ^le tempie.~ 

	|67-69.  il suo processo~: `their proceedings.'  |per te 
stesso~: on Dante's independence of party cp. Par. vi. 97-108. 

	|71-72.  del gran Lombardo~, &c.: Bartolommeo della Scala,
of Verona.  The arms of the Scaligers were a golden ladder in a
red field, surmounted by a black eagle, which was the imperial
ensign. 

	|74-75.  del fare~, &c.: `in the matter of conferring
favours and asking them, between you two that will come first
which between others comes later,' viz. conferring favours. 

	|76-78.  colui~: Can Grande, Bartolommeo's younger brother,
who became Lord of Verona in 1311.  As is well known, he was the
chief of Dante's patrons.  |impresso~, &c.: `received the impress
of this star (Mars),' i.e. was a warrior born.  |l' opere sue~:
his exertions in behalf of the Empire. 

	|80-81.  nove anni~: Can Grande was born on March 9, 1291,
and Cacciaguida is speaking from the point of view of 1300. 
|rote~: the heavenly spheres in their annual revolution. 

	|82-84.  il Guasco~: Pope Clement V, who was a native of 
Gascony.  He supported Henry of Luxemburg, when he came to Italy
in 1310, but afterwards went over to the side of his enemies. 
|argento~: freedom from avarice is one of the characteristics of
the ^Veltro~ in Inf. i. 103, which figure, in part at least, is 
identified with Can Grande.  |affanni~: his labours in Henry 
VII's interest. 

	|86.  ancora~: `hereafter'; cp. Par. xiv. 107. 

	|88-90.  a lui t' aspetta~: `place thy hopes in him'; cp.
Purg. xviii. 47.  |Per lui~, &c.: as what is said in these two 
lines is evidently laudatory, the meaning seems to be that Can 
Grande will take the side of the oppressed poor against their 
wealthy oppressors; but it need not imply, as has sometimes been
supposed, that any political movement is referred to. 

	|91-93.  E porteraine~, &c.: `and thou shalt bear away with
thee in thy mind a record concerning him, but shalt not divulge
it.'  |che fien~, &c.: `who will be on the spot when the time
arrives.'  |presente~: other examples of this form, where we 
should expect ^presenti~, are given in the ^Vocab. Tramater~; 
these seem to prove that it is an adverbial use. 

	|94-96.  le chiose~, &c.: `the explanations of (lit.
comments on) the intimations thou hast received' in Hell and 
Purgatory.  |che dietro~, &c.: `which are excluded from view by 
(lit. hidden behind) a few revolving years.'  Dante was exiled in
1302. 

	|98.  s' infutura~: `is destined to prolong itself.'  His 
fame with posterity is probably here intended; cp. l. 119. 

	|100-102.  Poi che~, &c.: `When by its silence showed that 
sainted soul That it had finished putting in the woof Into that 
web which I had given it warped' (Longf.).  As regards the 
expressions here used: -- |tela~ is a `web' or `texture,' and 
|ordire~ is `to warp' or `begin a web,' the warp being the 
threads which are first extended in the loom, and are crossed by
the woof (|la trama~).  The web here signifies the subject 
treated of, the warp the questions, the woof the answers. 
Similar metaphors derived from weaving will be found in Purg. 
xxxiii. 140; Par. iii. 95. 

	|105.  vuol dirittamente~: `is upright in will.' 

	|106-108.  sprona~: `spurs,' `hastens on.'  |s' abbandona~: 
`goes heedless on his way,' lit. `lets himself go'; for the use 
of ^abbandonarsi~ cp. Inf. ii. 34; Purg. xvii. 136; Par. xxxi. 
75. 

	|110-111.  Si che~, &c.: `so that, if I lose my native land,
I may not also lose other places of refuge through (too plain
speaking in) my poetry.' 

	|112-114.  lo mondo~, &c.: Hell.  |lo monte~: the Mountain
of Purgatory.  |mi levaro~: cp.  Par. i. 64-9, where the effect
of Beatrice's eyes in transporting Dante into Heaven is
described. 

	|115.  di lume~, &c.: `from one sphere of light to another.'

	|118-120.  E s' io~, &c.: `and, on the other hand, if I 
shrink from speaking the truth plainly, I fear the loss of 
reputation with posterity.'  |viver~: others read ^vita~, but 
|viver~ is supported by the MSS.  The infin. is used 
substantively. 

	|121.  il mio tesoro~: Cacciaguida. 

	|124-126.  fusca~, &c.: `darkened either by its own or by 
others' shame.'  |altrui~: of their relations and associates. 
|Pur~: `'tis true,' a concessive use with reference to ^Ma 
nondimen~ following; cp. Par. iii. 115. 

	|128-129.  fa manifesta~: `publish abroad.'  |E lascia pur~,
&c.: `and just let them scratch who feel the itch,' i.e. let
those feel annoyance at your words who have reason to be annoyed. 
Longf. compares Hamlet, iii. 2, `let the galled jade wince.' 

	|131-132.  vital nutrimento~, &c.: i.e. the lessons which it
teaches will be profitable when they have been laid to heart. 

	|135.  non fa~, &c.: `gives no slight proof of worth.' 

	|139-142.  Ch@e l' animo~, &c.: `for the mind of the hearer
does not rest satisfied or feel confidence on the strength of an
example drawn from what is insignificant, or other proof which is
not clear to view.'  |haia~ for ^abbia~; cp. Inf. xxi. 60.
