	|1-9.~  Beatrice now ceases for an instant from speaking,
fixing her eyes on the point of light which represents the Divine
Unity.  The instantaneous character of this pause is illustrated
by comparing it to a momentary astronomical phenomenon, viz. the
correspondence in position of the setting sun and the rising full
moon at the equinox, when they are opposite one another at the
same time on the horizon.  As the sun and moon are continually in
motion, this correspondence can only last an instant. 

	|1-3.  i figli~, &c.: Apollo and Diana, i.e. the Sun and
Moon.  |Coperti~, &c.: `surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,'
i.e. the sun being in Aries (|il Montone~), as it is at the
vernal equinox, and the moon in the opposite sign of Libra. 
|Fanno~, &c.: `are girdled by (i.e. are on) the horizon at the
same time.' 

	|4-6.  Quant' @e~, &c.: `as long a time as elapses from the
moment when the zenith makes an equipoise between them, until 
they respectively escape from (|dilibra~ for ^dilibera~) that 
girdle (their common horizon), changing their hemispheres (the 
one from the northern to the southern, the other ^vice versa~).'
The length of time, as remarked above, is an instant only. 
|inlibra~: `strikes an equilibrium' between the sun and moon; the
verb is used absolutely.  They are supposed to be in the scales 
of an invisible balance suspended from the zenith.  Another 
reading here in place of |il zenit inlibra~ is ^li tiene in 
libra~, in which case the passage must be translated -- `from the
moment which holds them balanced.'  The MS. authority for the 
two is about equal, but the unusual character of the words |zenit
inlibra~ is in favour of the former; see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, 
p. 496. 

	|9.  vinto~: cp. Par. xxviii. 16-8. 

	|10-84.~  The subjects about which Dante desires information
are (1) The creation of the angels -- -why, when, where and how
they were created (ll. 13-48); (2) The fall of the rebellious
angels, and the position of the faithful angels (ll. 49-66); (3)
The faculties of the angels (ll. 70-84).  

	|12.  Dove~, &c.: in God, to whom all time and every place
are present.  The Latin words in this line, and ^subsisto~ below,
are Scholastic terms. 

	|13-15.  Non per~, &c.: `not with a view to the acquisition
of good for Himself,' i.e. not to add to His own perfections. 
|ma perch@e~, &c.: `but in order that His glory by being
manifested in other beings might be able to say "I exist."' The
answer to the question, Why were the angels created? is: -- In
doing so God desired to show forth His love by endowing His
creatures with the glad consciousness of their separate
existence. 

	|16-18.~  These lines contain the answers to the questions,
When and Where the angels were created.  It was in eternity, and
before limitations of place (|comprender~) existed.  Since it was
simultaneous with that of the material universe, as Beatrice
presently explains, neither time nor space were already in
existence when they were created.  |altro~: beyond God himself. 
|i~: for ^gli~; cp.  Inf. ii. 17. 

	|19-21.  N@e prima~, &c.: `not that God before the creation
lay as it were inactive, for the moving of the Spirit of God on
the face of these waters (i.e. the act of creation, Gen. i. 2)
took place neither before nor after aught else.'  Time began with
the creation; before that there were no distinctions of time:
consequently it is inadmissible to speak of God as being inactive
^before~ the creation. 

	|22-24.  Forma~, &c.: `form and matter, both in combination
and uncombined, came forth into perfect being.'  `Form' in
Scholastic language is intellect; and pure form, or the purely
intellectual creation, is the angels.  Pure matter is the
material universe.  Form and matter combined is the human race. 
The creation is spoken of as `perfect,' because `God saw
everything that He had made, and behold it was very good' (Gen. 
i. 31).  |Come d' arco~, &c.: `all these three results of 
creation came forth together, like three arrows shot from a 
three-stringed bow.'  The three strings here represent the three
Persons of the Trinity, who participated in the Creation. 

	|25-27.  E come~, &c.: the illustration is intended to
signify that the creation was instantaneous, and also
simultaneous in respect of the three results just mentioned. 
|dal venire~, &c.: the ray of light no sooner falls upon them 
than it illuminates them throughout.  |esser tutto~: lit. `being
in them completely.' 

	|28-30.  Cos@i~, &c.: `so did the threefold result beam
forth simultaneously from its Lord in completeness of its being 
without any distinction of time in their commencement.' 

	|31-33.  Concreato~, &c.: `the order of these three
substances -- viz. pure form, pure matter, and the combination of
them -- -was created and ordained (|costrutto~) along with them.' 
|quelle~: the angels.  |puro atto~: in Scholastic language ^actus
purus~ means the same as ^forma tantum~; and that, as we have
seen, is a description of the purely intellectual creation, the
angels. 

	|34-36.  Pura potenza~: potentiality is the capacity of
being acted upon, or receptivity; hence `pure potentiality' means
the rnaterial creation, which is simply receptive.  |nel mezzo~,
&c.: `intermediate between these was receptivity combined with 
intellect (i.e. the human race), which two elements were held 
together by a bond so powerful that it can never be unbound.' 
|giammai~, &c., must be understood in a qualified sense as
meaning that the two elements can never be ^permanently~
separated'; for the bond is suspended by death, but it will be 
resumed again at the resurrection, and will then continue for 
ever.  The order of things created which is described in ll. 31-6
is based on Aristotle, ^De An.~ ii. 2. 15; see Moore, ^Studies~,
i. p. 109. 

	|37-39.  Jeronimo~, &c.: `in Jerome's writings you will find
it said of the angels that they were created long ages before the
rest of the universe was made,' lit. `Jerome wrote for you about
the angels as being created a long period of ages before,' &c. 
The reference is to Jerome on Titus i. 2, `Sex millia necdum
nostri orbis implentur anni, et quantas prius aeternitates,
quanta tempora, quantas saeculorum origines fuisse arbitrandum
est; in quibus Angeli, Throni, Dominationes caeteraeque virtutes
servierint Deo.'  In connexion with this passage Aquinas says
(^Summa~, i. Q. 61. Art. 3): -- - `Circa hoc invenitur duplex
sanctorum doctorum sententia; illa tamen probabilior videtur quod
angeli simul cum creatura corporea sunt creati.' 

	|40-41.  questo vero~: the simultaneous creation of the
angels and the rest of the universe; see ll. 28-30.  |lati~: 
`passages.' Instances of such passages are Ecclus. xviii. 1 `Qui
vivit in aeternum creavit omnia ^simul~' (Vulg.), and Gen. i. 1 
`In the beginning' which words, according to one interpretation 
(see Aquinas, ^loc. cit.~) were regarded as implying that nothing
had been created before. 

	|43-45.  la ragione~, &c.: the argument is, that as the
office of the angelic Intelligences was to move and guide the 
Heavens, it was unsuitable that they should be created long 
before the Heavens were in existence.  |sua perfezion~: that 
which was the object or final cause of their existence was the 
`complement' of their being. 

	|46-48.  questi amori~: the angels.  |come~: `in what
fashion'; this is explained in ll. 32, 33, where it is said that
the angels were by their nature ^Puro affetto.~  |ardori~:
`fires,' i.e. questions by which your desire of knowledge is 
kindled. 

	|49-51.  N@e giugneriesi~, &c.: Beatrice now turns to the
Fall of the rebellious angels.  This took place immediately after
their creation; `before one could count twenty'; cp. ^Conv.~ ii.
6. ll. 95-7, `Dico che di tutti questi Ordini si perderono alcuni
tosto che furono creati.'  |Turb@o~, &c.: `disturbed the
nethermost of your elements., The earth is the nethermost of
these, because air, fire, and water rise above it; for |il
suggetto~, in this sense cp. Par. ii. 107.  The `disturbance' of
the earth caused by Lucifer's fall is described in Inf. xxxiv. 
121-6. 

	|52.~  L' altra~, &c.: `the other part (the faithful angels)
remained in Heaven.'  |quest' arte~: that of revolving round the
Divine Unity. 

	|57.  costretto~: `compressed,' `crushed.'  Lucifer occupied
the centre of the earth, which was also the centre of gravity;
cp. Inf. xxxiv. 110, 111, `il punto Al qual si traggon d' ogni
parte i pesi.' 

	|58-60.  furon modesti~, &c.: `were humble in recognizing
that they proceeded from the goodness, which had created them 
fit for so great intelligence,' i.e. capable of enjoying the 
Presence of God. 

	|61-63.  Perch@e~: `wherefore.'  |con lor merto~, &c.: the 
merit of the faithful angels consisted, as we learn from l. 65, 
in their acceptance, by the exercise of their free-will, of God's
illuminative grace; the result of this was, that their wills 
became immutably fixed on God and on His service, so that they 
could never fall away.  It was through lack of this that the 
rebellious angels fell; cp. Par.  xix. 48, `per non aspettar 
lume.' 

	|64-66.  dubbi~: the doubt which is here implied turned on
the question, whether the faithful angels had done anything to 
deserve their blessedness.  |Secondo che~, &c.: `in proportion to
the receptivity of the affection.'  |gli~: for ^le~, referring to
^grazia.~ 

	|67-69.  Omai~, &c.: `now thou mayst devote thy thoughts to
the full without further aid to the subject of this angelic
assembly, if thou hast laid to heart my words.' 

	|70-84.~  Beatrice now speaks of the nature and faculties of
the angels.  She affirms that they possess intelligence and will
but denies them the power of memory.  Aquinas (^Summa~, i. Q. 54.
Art. 5) within certain limits allows them memory. 

	|71.  Si |legge~: `it is taught (in lectures) in your
schools.' 

	|74-75.  La verit@a~, &c.: `the truth which on earth men
confound, equivocating in such prelections.'  By `equivocating,'
is meant `using words in more than one meaning.'  The particular
word referred to is `memory,' which sometimes means the knowledge
of what is past, sometimes the recalling of what has been -- at
least for the time -- forgotten.  In the latter meaning of the
term, which is the usual one, angels have no memory, because they
forget nothing, since everything is present to them in the face
of God.  The knowledge of the past, no doubt, they possess. 

	|76-81.  Queste~, &c.: `the angels, from the time when they
were blessed with God's countenance, kept their eyes steadfastly
fixed on it; and as God sees all things, they see all past events
reflected there, and no object which has presented itself to them
at an earlier time can be intercepted by a subsequent one;
consequently, there is no need of the process of recollection to
recall a forgotten impression.'  |vedere~: `sight'; `their vision
is not intercepted by a fresh object presenting itself.'  |per
concetto diviso~: lit. `owing to a thought having been separated
from them (put out of sight).' 

	|82-84.  S@i che~, &c.: `so that on earth, when men make
such statements as that the angels possess the power of memory, 
they dream with their eyes open, some believing that they speak 
the truth, others not believing; but the latter incur more blame
and more disgrace.'  |non dormendo si sogna~: this means: --
`They talk vaguely on questions involving established truth.' 
The truth is plain before them, yet they prefer to speculate. 
|Credendo~, &c.: `some think that these statements which they 
extemporize are true while others make them only in order to 
gratify their hearers; the latter class deserve severer 
condemnation.' 

	|85-126.~  Beatrice, taking for her text the fanciful
teaching that prevailed on the subject of the nature of angels, 
denounces the devices that were in vogue among the popular 
preachers of the day to win the favour of their audiences. 

	|85-87.  Voi non~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `There is one
right way, the way of truth; you on earth in your philosophizing
follow a variety of devious tracks instead of it.'  |L' amor~, 
&c.: `the love of display (|apparenza~, lit. the appearance of 
cleverness) and the gratifying reflexions which that display 
suggests (|il suo pensiero~).' 

	|88-90.  Ed ancor~, &c.: `yet even this is borne in Heaven
with less indignation than the neglect or the perversion of Holy
Writ.' 

	|91-93.  Non vi~, &c.: `on earth men do not reflect on all
the blood of the martyrs which has been the price of
disseminating it throughout the world, or how acceptable to God 
is he who in humility holds fast by it.'  |Seminarla~: |la~ is
the Christian faith, implied in |La divina scrittura.~ 

	|94-96.  Per apparer~, &c.: `display is what each one aims
at, inventing new views of his own, and these are the themes of
the preachers, while about the Gospel not a word is said.' 

	|97.  Un dice~, &c.: as an instance of a subject unsuited 
for treatment in the pulpit, which nevertheless was a popular one
in the hands of preachers, Beatrice mentions the various theories
concerning the cause of the darkness at the time of our Lord's 
crucifixion.  These are from Aquinas, ^Summa~, iii. Q. 44. Art. 
2.  Dante only mentions them, without raising the question 
whether they are right or wrong.  |si ritorse~: `returned on its
course.' 101, 102.  |Da s@e~: without being eclipsed by any other
body.  |per@o~, &c.: `in consequence of this disappearance of the
light, the darkness (according to them) affected the whole world
from farthest West to farthest East.'  |rispose~: `corresponded
to,' `equally affected.' 

	|103-105.  Lapi e Bindi~: `common men.'  These were popular
abbreviations of familiar names in Dante's time -- Lapo for
Jacopo, Bindo for Aldobrando.  |per anno~: `in the course of the
year.'  |quinci e quindi~: `now from one side, now from the 
other,' i.e. giving now one, now another explanation. 

	|108.  non le scusa~, &c.: `unconsciousness of the harm they
suffer is no excuse for them' because they should not confide in
such worthless pastors. 

	|109-111.  convento~: `band of followers'; the Apostles are
meant.  |verace fondamento~: the truth as it is in Jesus. 

	|112.  quel tanto~, &c.: `only that was heard on their
lips,' lit. `in their cheeks, mouths.'  For |tanto~ in the sense
of Lat. ^tantum~ cp. Par. ii. 67; xviii. 13. 

	|115-117.  con motti e con iscede~: `with witticisms and 
buffooneries.'  |iscede~ is for ^scede~; cp. ^iscegliendo~ for 
^scegliendo~ in Purg. xxviii. 41.  |pur che~, &c.: `if only the 
congregation laugh well, the preacher's cowl is puffed up (with 
vanity), and that is all he desires.' 

	|118-120.  tale uccel~, &c.: `such a winged monster (the 
devil) nestles in its angle.'  The |becchetto~ is the point of 
the cowl.  |vederebbe~, &c.: `they would discover the true value
of the pardon (indulgences) in which they put their trust.' 

	|121-123.  Per cui~, &c.: `by reason of which (indulgences) 
such folly prevails on earth, that without any evidence of 
authorization (|testimonio~) on the part of him who makes the 
offer, men are ready to rush together at every promise of them.' 

	|124-126.  Di questo~, &c.: `on this (credulity) St. Antony
fattens his pig.'  The hog which appears in pictures at the feet
of St. Antony, the Egyptian hermit, represents the demon of 
sensuality which he conquered.  In the middle ages the swine of
the monks of St. Antony were allowed to feed in the streets of 
cities, and were fed by devout persons (Jameson, ^Sacred and 
Legendary Art~, pp. 750, 751); this is what Dante refers to. 
|altri~: concubines, and other hangers-on of the monasteries. 
|moneta senza conio~: `money without the true stamp,' i.e.
unauthorized indulgences. 

	|127-145.~  Beatrice now returns to the subject of the
angels, and speaks of their number, of the degrees in which they
partake of the divine effluence, and of the glory of God as 
manifested in them. 

	|128-129.  la dritta strada~: the course of the statement
which I was pursuing.  |S@i che~, &c.: `so that, as our allotted
time draws to an end, we may make corresponding progress with our
subject,' lit. `that our way also may be shortened.' 

	|130-132.  Questa natura~: the nature of the angels.  |s@i 
oltre~, &c.: `is so beyond measure multiplied in number (|s' 
ingrada~, lit. increases step by step) as to exceed all power of
expression and mortal thought.' 

	|134-135.  in sue migliaia~, &c.: `when he speaks of
thousands, no fixed number is expressed.'  The passage referred 
to is Dan. vii. 10, `Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and
ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.'  This only 
means an indefinitely great number. 

	|136-138.  La prima~, &c.: `the primal light (God), which 
irradiates the whole angelic nature, is received into it in as 
many modes as are the bright beings with which it is mated.' 
This means, in other words, that in things incorruptible there is
only one individual in each species.  The principle which is here
enunciated is based on Aquinas, ^Summa~, i. Q. 50. Art. 4;
`Perfectio naturae angelicae requirit multiplicationem specierum,
non autern multiplicationem individuorum in una specie.'  See 
Gardner, ^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 213. 

	|139-141.  Onde~, &c.: `whence, inasmuch as the affection 
is in proportion to the conceptive act (i.e. to the assimilation
of the divine light), the sweetness of love is more or less warm
in it in different degrees.' 

	|144.  Speculi...in che si spezza~: the angels are mirrors,
each of which receives its portion of the divine light.
