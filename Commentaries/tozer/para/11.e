	|1-12.~  The revelation of the joys and the glory of the
life of spirits in Heaven which has just been presented to Dante,
causes him to turn his thoughts downwards to earth, and to
reflect on the paltriness of men's occupations there. 

	|2-3.  Quanto~, &c.: `how weak are the reasons (lit.
arguments) which make thee wing thy course downwards,' i.e.
`pursue low aims.'  For |sillogismi~ cp. ^sillogizz@o~ in Par. x.
138. 

	|4-5.  aforismi~: the study of Medicine is meant, the
`Aphorisms' (medical precepts) of Hippocrates being taken to 
represent it.  In this and the following line the three learned 
professions of Law, Medicine, and the Church are described.  The
Ministry of the Church (|sacerdozio~) is here regarded, like the 
other professions, as a means of worldly advancement. 

	|6-9.  E chi regnar~, &c.: the construction of the remainder
of the sentence is not clear.  It is possible, with Scartazzini,
to make |regnar~ and |rubare~ depend on |S' affaticava~, but then
there is no government for |civil negozio~; and, moreover, |Chi~
in l. 8, not being introduced by a conjunction, appears to be the
commencement of a separate statement.  It seems preferable to
understand ^sen giva~ a (supplied from what precedes) with the
three clauses in ll. 6, 7 (|E chi sen giva a regnare~, &c.), and
to start afresh in l. 8.  |sofismi~: `false claims,' as a
Pretender.  |nel diletto~, &c.: `was wearying himself by being
absorbed in the pleasures of the flesh.' 

	|15.  come~, &c.: the point of the comparison is, that a
candle in a candlestick, unlike a swinging lamp or a taper
carried in a procession, is fixed. 

	|16.  senti'~: the suppression of the predicate after this
verb, notwithstanding that |sorridendo~ and |facendosi~ refer to
it, aptly suggests that the spirit concealed within its own light
was invisible. 

	|19-21.  suo raggio~: that of the |luce eterna~, God.  `My 
own brightness is derived from the face of God; and, in like 
manner, when I look into His face, I read there the origin of 
what is passing in your mind,' lit. `your thoughts, whence you 
derive (cause) them.'  For the statement that the Blessed in 
Heaven read the thoughts of others in the mind of God, cp. Par. 
viii. 85-9; xv. 61-3. 

	|22-26.  hai voler~, &c.: `you desire that my words, where 
I said above |U' ben s' impingua~, &c., should be sifted anew in
language so clear and so explicit, that they may be brought down
to the level of your perception.'  |U' ben~, &c.: Par. x. 96. 
|Non nacque~, &c.: Par. x. 114.  |nacque~ here has a great 
preponderance of MS. authority over ^surse~, which is often read.
The latter was probably introduced because it is the actual word
used in x. 114. 

	|27.  che ben~, &c.: `that we should make the points under
discussion quite clear.'  St. Thomas now addresses himself to
Dante's first difficulty, which relates to the two great Orders
of the Franciscans and the Dominicans.  The other difficulty,
which relates to the wisdom of Solomon, he recurs to in Par.
xiii. 31 foll.

	|31-34.  Perocch@e~, &c.: `in order that the spouse of Him
who to the sound of a loud cry espoused her with His precious
blood (the Church), might follow the path which leads to her 
Beloved One (might make progress in the Christian life),
confident in herself, and withal more faithful to Him.'  |ad alte
grida~: `uttering loud cries,' Matt. xxvii. 46, 50.

	|35-36: Due Principi~: St. Francis and St. Domenic.  Observe
how, to exclude the idea of rivalry between the founders of the
two Monastic Orders, and between their followers, St. Thomas, a
Dominican, here sings the praises of St. Francis, while in Canto
XII St. Bonaventura, a Franciscan, celebrates St. Domenic.
|quinci e quindi~: `on either side'; |quinci~, meaning the
latter, refers to ^a lui pi@u fida~, love being the bond of
conjugal faithfulness; |quindi~, meaning the former, to ^In s@e
sicura~, odhodoxy being the guarantee of the Church's safety: the
applicability of this to the |Due Principi~ is explained in the
next three lines. 

	|37-39.  L' un~, &c.: St. Francis was distinguished by the 
intensity of his love and devotion both to God and to his fellow
men, while St. Domenic (|L' altro~) was conspicuous as a champion
of orthodoxy in doctrine.  The Seraphim were regarded as
embodying love, the Cherubim knowledge; hence the application of
the epithets |serafico~ and |cherubico~ to these two saints.

	|40~ foll.  St. Francis (1182-1226), who is here spoken of,
was the son of Pietro Bernardone, a wool merchant of Assisi.  At
24 years of age he devoted himself to a religious life, and took
upon him vows of poverty, which also he established as the rule
of the Order which he founded.  This Order received the sanction,
first of Innocent III, and afterwards of Honorius III.  In 1219
he went to Egypt with the object of converting the Sultan of that
country, but his preaching was unsuccessful.  Towards the end of
his life he retired to the monastery of Alvernia in the
Apennines, where he is said to have received the `stigmata' or 
marks of our Lord's crucifixion in his hands and feet and side. 

	|43-45.  Intra~, &c.: Assisi, which is here described, is 
situated on the lower slopes of the Monte Subasio (|alto monte~),
an outlier of the Apennines, with the river Tupino flowing on its
southernmost side, and the Chiascio on the western.  These join
their waters at some distance below the town, and then flow into
the Tiber.  The Chiascio rises near Gubbio, of which place St.
Ubaldo was bishop and where he had his hermitage; it is rather
this latter point which is referred to in |eletto del beato
Ubaldo.~ 

	|46.  Perugia~: this city is situated on high ground 
fourteen miles to the westward of Assisi, and separated from it 
by the valley of the Tiber.  It can with truth be said to get its
cold -- especially on its eastern side, on which the gate of 
Perugia called the |porta Sole~ stands -- from the Monte Subasio,
because the cold winds blow off the Apennines from that quarter. 
What is meant by its getting its heat from thence, it is not so
easy to say, for the distance is too great for Perugia to be
affected by the reflexion of heat from those mountains (though
possibly Dante thought that this was the case).  Perhaps it means
that the sun rises in that quarter. 

	|47-48.  diretro~, &c.: the towns of Nocera and Gualdo lie
on the opposite side of the Monte Subasio to Assisi.  They are
said to `groan under a heavy yoke' because they were oppressed by
the people of Perugia. 

	|50-51.  un sole~: St. Francis.  |Come fa~, &c.: `as the sun
in which we are |(questo~) rises at times from the Ganges,' i.e.
from the east, the mouth of the Ganges being to Dante the limit
of the habitable world in that direction; cp. Purg. ii. 4, 5.
|Tal volta~ (`at times') means in the summer season, and thus
enhances St. Francis' meed of praise, since it implies that it is
only when the sun is brightest that it can be compared to him:
For the use of |tal volta~ here cp. Par. xii. 51. 

	|52-54.  Per@o~, &c.: `wherefore let him who speaks of that
place not call it Ascesi ("I rose"), which would give an
inadequate meaning, but Oriente ("the East"), if he would give it
a suitable name.'  Ascesi was in Dante's time the popular name of
Assisi; playing on this, St. Thomas says that `I rose' 
insufficiently expressed its dignity, and that `the East' should
be substituted for it, since it was the place where a Sun (^un 
sole~, l. 50, i.e. St. Francis) had risen. 

	|55-57.  Non era~, &c.: `this Sun was not far distant from 
his rising,' i.e. St. Francis was not far advanced in years.  He
was 24 years old, when he was seized with the desire of
renouncing the world.  |Ch' ei~, &c.: `when he began to cause the
earth to feel some comfort from his mighty influence'; |terra~ is
here used instead of ^mondo~, because the metaphor of the sun is
still maintained. 

	|58-60.  Ch@e~, &c.: `since while yet a youth he incurred 
his father's wrath for a lady's sake, to whom, even as to death,
no one doth unlock the gate of pleasure.'  The lady is Poverty 
(see l. 74), who, like death, is an unwelcome guest where
pleasure dwells.  The biographers of St. Francis dwell on his 
father's strong opposition to his desire of embracing a life of 
poverty. 

	|61-62.  Ed innanzi~, &c.: St. Francis renounced all right
to his inheritance in the presence of his father and of the
Bishop of Assisi, even giving up his clothes, and putting on 
those of an artisan which the Bishop gave him; see Milman, ^Lat.
Christianity~, iv. pp. 172, 173.
|sua spirital corte~: the court of the bishop of his
native city.  |Et coram patre~: the words are in Lat. as being a
legal form, the marriage between St. Francis and Poverty being
regarded as a formal contract.  |unito~: `joined in marriage';
this is represented in a fresco by Giotto in the church at
Assisi. 

	|64-66.  primo marito~: Christ, who lived a life of poverty. 
|mille cent' anni e pi@u~: this represents the interval between
the death of Christ and the vow of St. Francis.  The date of the
latter was 1207, and consequently more than 1100 years after the
death of Christ.  The round number is used, as in Par. vi. 4 and
38, because exact dates are inadmissible in poetry.  |senza
invito~: `without courtship,' `without a suitor.' 

	|67-69.  N@e valse~, &c.: `nor did it avail aught (in her 
behalf) that men heard (lit. for men to hear) how that Caesar, 
who inspired the whole world with terror, found her, in company 
with the fisherman Amyclas, unmoved at the sound of his voice.' 
In describing two typical instances of the moral grandeur of
poverty, which nevertheless the world had ignored, Dante follows
the method which he has observed elsewhere, of taking one
instance from the classics, the other from Scripture.  The story
of the poor fisherman Amyclas, whom Caesar visited by night in 
order that he (Amyclas) might convey him across the Adriatic, is
given by Lucan, v. 504 foll.  The moral of this, relating to the
independence and confidence of poverty, which Lucan draws, is as
follows: -- `O vitae tuta facultas Pauperis angustique lares! O 
munera nondum Intellecta de#um! Quibus hoc contingere templis Aut
potuit muris, nullo trepidare tumultu, Caesarea pulsante manu? 
(ll. 527-31).' These lines are translated by Dante in ^Conv.~ iv.
13. ll. 110-21. 

	|70-72.  N@e valse esser~, &c.: `nor did it avail her
(Poverty) that she was enduring and courageous -- so much so,
that where Mary remained at the foot of the cross, Poverty was 
elevated on the cross itself with Christ.'  Thus Poverty was more
closely associated with Christ in His dying hour even than His 
Mother.  Christ hanging naked and destitute on the cross is the 
instance taken from Scripture of the moral grandeur of poverty. 
|feroce~: the word is here used in the proper classical meaning 
of Lat. ^ferox~, viz. `high-spirited,' `courageous.'  |salse~: 
others read ^pianse.~ 

	|73-75.  troppo chiuso~: `in too obscure terms.'  |parlar 
diffuso~: `prolonged discourse.' 

	|76-78.  La lor~, &c.: `their unanimity and the gladness of
their looks (i.e. the perfect resignation and cheerfulness with
which St. Francis led a life of poverty) brought it to pass that
the love and admiration and sympathy (which they excited in men's
minds) produced thoughts of saintliness; -- to such a degree that
(|Tanto che~),' &c.  The sight of St. Francis' self-sacrifice
caused others to follow his example. 

	|79-81.  Bernardo~: Bernard of Quintavalle, a wealthy man,
who was the first follower of St. Francis.  |Si scalz@o~: `went
barefoot,' according to St. Francis' example, which was adopted
by his Order. 

	|82-84.  ferace~: `productive,' because of the rapid
increase of disciples.  |Egidio~: another wealthy man, who became
St. Francis' third disciple.  |Silvestro~: a priest at Assisi. 
|si la sposa piace~: `such are the charms of the bride,' i.e. the
attractions of poverty. 

	|85-87.  sen va~: `goes on his way,' to Rome; this is seen 
to be the meaning from ll. 91, 92.  |legava~, &c.: `was girding 
on the humble cord'; it was from this cord that the Franciscans 
obtained the name of Cordiglieri. 

	|88-93.  N@e gli grav@o~, &c.: `nor was he depressed (lit.
forced to cast down his eyes) with shame, either at being the son
(|fi'~ for ^figlio~) of Pietro Bernardone, or at being an object
of unutterable contempt.'  This must be taken in connexion with
ll. 91, 92, where he is spoken of as presenting himself before
the Pope.  On that occasion he was not shamefaced on account of
the meanness of his origin or his contemptible appearance, but
`like a prince declared to Innocent his stern intention' of
founding his Order: It is a little difficult to reconcile the
statement about the meanness of his origin with the fact that his
father was a well-to-do merchant; but this appears to be the
meaning, for St. Bonaventura in his Life of St. Francis says
that, when the epithets `boorish' and `mercenary' were applied to
him, the Saint was wont to reply, that such reproaches were
suitably addressed to Pietro Bernardone's son (`Talia enim licet
audire filium Petri de Bernardone').  |Innocenzio~: Pope Innocent
III, who signified to him in 1214 his approval of the Order. 
|sigillo~, &c.: `seal of approval of his monastic rule.' 

	|96.  Meglio~, &c.: `better in high Heaven' than by unworthy
Franciscan friars on earth.  That this is the meaning is rendered
probable by the following passage in an early life of St. Francis
by Prudenzano, which Dante may well have seen: -- `Dai Serafini
(tanta era stata la virt@u del Santo) le Salmodie in onore di lui
^meglio e pi@u degnamente sarebbersi cantate nella gloria del
cielo~, anzich@e da' suoi frati degeneri in coro.'  See Moore,
^Studies~, i. p. 86, where the authority is the ^Studi Danteschi~
of da Carbonara. 

	|98-99.  per Onorio~, &c.: `by the eternal Spirit speaking
through the mouth of Honorius.'  Pope Honorius III approved the
Order in 1223.  |archimandrita~: this title, which is in use in
the Greek Church, originally signified the Head of a monastery
(%mu%alpha%nu%delta%rho%alpha\, `sheepfold'); hence it is
suitably employed here of the founder of a monastic Order.  In
^De Mon.~ iii. 9. l. 123 Dante applies it to St. Peter.

	|101-102.  Soldan~: the Sultan of Egypt in his camp before
Damietta; see note on l. 40.  |gli altri~: the lives of his
apostles and saints.

	|103-105.  acerba~: `unripe'; cp. Purg. xi. 117.  |per non~,
&c.: `that he might not tarry unavailingly.'  |Reddissi~: from 
^reddire~, arch. form of ^riedere~, here used as a reflexive
verb.  |al frutto~, &c.: `to the harvest of the Italian crop' 
(Butler); i.e. to minister to the faithful in Italy. 

	|106-108.  sasso~: the Monte Alvernia in the Casentino, 
between the upper waters of the Tiber and the Arno, where St. 
Francis founded his monastery, and where he is said to have 
received the ^stigmata.~  These were the |ultimo sigillo~, or 
`final seal of approval,' in which expression |ultimo~ is used in
reference to the ^primo sigillo~ of l. 93, and the ^seconda 
corona~ of l. 97.  |portarno~: for ^portarono.~ 

	|112.  erede~: `heirs'; see note on Purg. vii. 118. 

	|115-117.  del suo grembo~: `from her (Poverty's) bosom.' 
|Ed al~, &c.: `and for his body desired no other bier' than the 
bosom of Poverty, i.e. than the bare ground on which he lay. 
When he felt his end approaching, he desired that he should be 
conveyed to his chapel of the Portiuncula (Santa Maria degli 
Angeli) near Assisi, and should be laid on the ground; and there
he died. 

	|118-120.  Pensa~, &c.: St. Thomas now returns to the point
from which he originally started, the solution of Dante's
difficulty raised by the words `U' ben s' impingua se non si 
vaneggia' (l. 25;, cp. Par. x. 96), which refer to the original 
excellence and subsequent corruption of the Dominican Order. 
Having described the life of St. Francis, he turns to his compeer
St. Domenic, and remarks on the degenerate condition of his 
followers.  |a mantener~, &c.: `to keep the bark of Peter (the 
Church) safe in the open sea (where storms prevail) by directing
it to its proper destination (the kingdom of Heaven).'  |segno~: 
lit. `a mark for which to steer.' 

	|121-123.  nostro~: St. Thomas being a Dominican.  |qual 
segue~, &c.: `when a man follows faithfully in his wake, you can
be sure that he is freighted with good merchandize.'  |carca~:
for ^carica.~ 

	|126.  salti~: `mountain pastures'; the eagerness of the 
Dominicans to obtain high offices in the Church is here censured. 

	|128-129.  esso~: their leader, St. Domenic.  |latte~: 
spiritual nutriment for others. 

	|130-132.  Ben~, &c.: `true it is that there are some among
them.'  |le cappe~, &c.: `it requires little cloth to make their
cowls.' 

	|133.  fioche~: `weak,' `vague in meaning.' 

	|136-137.  In parte~: because one of your two difficulties
will have been explained.  |la pianta~, &c.: `the tree from which
the splinter is broken,' i.e. the fact from which the deduction
is made; the fact being the corruption of the Dominican Order,
the deduction St. Thomas's remark upon it in Par. x. 96, `U'
ben,' &c.  Other interpreters say `the plant that is chipped
away,' i.e. the Dominican Order that is being corrupted. 

	|138-139.  E vedrai~, &c.: |coreggier~ here is taken to 
mean `the wearer of a strap or thong (^coreggia~),' a title 
invented by Dante for the Dominicans, to correspond to
^Cordigliero~, the name of the Franciscans.  `And you will see 
what the Dominican friar means, when he uses the words, "where 
one thrives well, if he does not give himself up to vanity."' The
Dominican friar here is St. Thomas himself, and the meaning is --
`you will understand what I as a Dominican friar meant by what I 
said above (in Par. x. 96).  ^Corregger~ is sometimes read in 
place of |coreggier~, and it is impossible from the MSS. to 
decide between them.  With regard to this point Dr.  Moore writes
to me: -- `"I" is so often inserted in MSS. between "g" and "e" 
(e.g. "^scorgier,~" "^leggie,~" "^reggie,~" &c.), and also the 
double consonant is so habitually neglected, that unless one were
dealing with a MS. which was quite unusually careful in its 
orthography, one could never feel very confident in respect of 
such evidence.'  With this reading the passage is best translated
thus: -- `you will see the reproof (^il corregger~) implied in 
the words,' &c.
