	|3.  sposa~: the bride of Christ is the company of the
redeemed, whom He purchased with His own blood. 

	|4.  l' altra~: the angels. 

	|7-9.  s' infiora~: `descends into the flowers.'  |si
ritorna~, &c.: `returns to the place where its labour is turned 
to sweetness,' i.e. to the hive, where the pollen which the bees
have gathered is converted into honey. 

	|12.  L@a dove~, &c.: to the presence of God.  That this is
meant, is clearly shown by the word |risaliva~ here, and by ^lo
interporsi tra il disopra e il fiore~ in l. 19, both of which
imply that the place between which and the Rose the angels pass
and repass is the higher region where God himself is present.  It
is well to observe this, because in the allegorical vision by
which the revelation of the Empyrean is anticipated, the sparks,
which represent the angels, pass between the flowers (the saints)
and the river of light (Par. xxx. 61-9); and this has suggested
to some the erroneous view, that in the present passage the
angels go to and fro between the petals of the rose and the sea
of light, though that sea was on a lower level, and was a
reflexion of the glory of God, and not his very Presence. 

	|13-15.  fiamma~: perhaps the three colours here given
represent respectively love, wisdom, and purity.  |termine~: 
`degree (lit. limit, measure) of whiteness.' 

	|16-18.  banco~: this corresponds in meaning to ^soglie
grado~ of Par. xxx. 1131 15.  |ventilando il fianco~: `by waving
their wings,' lit. `by fanning their flanks.'  What is here 
implied is, that the angels acquired this peace and love when 
flying upwards to God, i.e. in their aspiration towards Him.  If
a comma is introduced after |acquistavan~, the meaning is: -- 
`They distributed (imparted) by the waving of their wings the 
peace and love which they won from the sight of God.' 

	|19-21.  N@e lo interporsi~, &c.: `nor did the interposition
of so great a multitude of flying creatures between the flower
and that which was above it (the Godhead) impede the sight of the
splendour.'  |la vista e lo splendore~: this seems to be a
hendiadys. 

	|23-24.  secondo ch' @e degno~: `according to the fitness of
its parts to receive it'; the principle here is the same as that
stated in Par. i. 1-3.  In the present connexion the words seem
to be introduced in order to imply, that in Heaven, since all its
inhabitants are worthy, though in different degrees, to receive
God's light, it must penetrate everywhere.  |nulla~, &c.: `no
object can impede it,' and therefore here the angels cannot. 

	|26-27.  Frequente~, &c.: `peopled by folk of the Old and
the New Dispensation.'  The grouping of the saints who belong to
these two respectively is given in Par. xxxii. 22-7.  |ad un
segno~: `fixed on one object.' 

	|28-30.  unica stella~: this is used metaphorically to
represent the Divine Unity.  |appaga~: there is a change here
from the second to the third person: `O Trinal light -- -the
light that so contents them.'  |Guarda~, &c.: this is a prayer
for God's mercy: `Look down (with compassion) on our tempestuous
life on earth.' Compare the appeal to the saints in the sixth
Heaven for their intercession in behalf of struggling humanity;
Par. xviii. 124-6. 

	|31-33.  tal plaga~, &c.: the North, where the Great Bear is
always high in the Heavens.  It does not mean `the region where
the Great Bear never sets,' for that would apply to the whole of
Europej as Dante was aware; cp. ^Canz.~ xv. 28, 29, `Dal paese d'
Europa, che non perde Le sette stelle gelide unquemai.' |Elice~;
the nymph, otherwise called Callisto, who was seduced by Jupiter,
and after having been metamorphosed into a she-bear through the
jealousy of Juno, was placed by him in Heaven as the
constellation of the Great Bear, while her son whom she bore to
him was made the constellation of Bootes.  Dante obtained the
story from Ov. ^Met.~ ii. 466-530.  The seduction of Helice is
alluded to in Purg. xxv. 130-2. 

	|34-36.  ardua sua opra~: `her lofty edifices.'  |quando~, 
&c.: the period here referred to is probably that of the
barbarian invasions of Rome, when the Lateran palace, which was 
given by Constantine to Pope Sylvester, had become the Papal 
residence, and the basilica of St. John Lateran was the grandest
existing Christian church.  In this case the words |Alle cose~, 
&c. (`surpassed all mortal things') have a double application, 
referring both to the dignity of the Papal see, and to the 
sublimity of the building.  Others think that the reference is to
the Jubilee of 1300, at which time the Lateran was the dwelling-
place of the Popes, and that |Barbari~ are the `outlandish 
foreigners,' who, as Villani tells us (viii. 36), visited Rome on
that occasion. 

	|37.~  Io, |che al~: the scansion here is unusual, Io being
pronounced as a disyllable, and |che~ being unelided.  In the
case of Io the peculiar use is to be explained by its being
emphatic and having a pause after it.  In l. 47 also the scansion
is exceptional, the final ^a~ of ^Menava~ being unelided and ^io~
being a disyllable. 

	|41-42.  tra esso~, &c.: `what with the stupefaction and the
joy it caused me pleasure to hear nothing and to remain
speechless.'  |libito~ is used substantively; cp. Inf. v. 56. 

	|43-45.  si ricrea....riguardando~: `takes pleasure in
gazing.'  |gi@a~: `ere long.'  This word is occasionally used of
future time, especially of the immediate future; see ^Vocab.
Tramater.~ 

	|49-51.  suadi~: `persuasive'; the word is adapted from the
Latin.  |atti~: `bearing,' `mien.' 

	|53.  mio~: this is metrically a disyllable owing to the 
influence of ^sg~ following; see note on Inf. viii. 11. 

	|58-60.  Uno~, &c.: `I had one object in my mind, and
another met my glance'; i.e. what I did see was different from
what I expected to see.  |Beatrice~: Beatrice had now quitted 
Dante, and resumed her place among the most exalted saints.  |un
Sene~: St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153).  The qualities which
caused Dante to select this saint as a person specially fitted to
introduce him to the highest mysteries of Heaven, were his
intense spirituality, his rare force of character, through which
he exercised an extraordinary influence over his age, his
position as a champion of orthodoxy, and his conspicuous devotion
to the Blessed Virgin.  He is regarded as symbolizing
contemplation; cp. ll. 110, 111; Par. xxxii. 1.  He takes the
place of Beatrice in this part of the poem in the same way as
Matelda in the Terrestrial Paradise takes the place of Virgil. 
|Vestito con~: `robed like,' i.e. in white robes.  For the use of
|con~ meaning `corresponding to' cp. Purg. xxix. 145. 

	|61-62.  Diffuso era~, &c.: `his eyes and cheeks were
overspread (lit. he was overspread, &c.) with benign joy.'
|gene~: Lat. ^genae.~  |in atto pio~: `affectionate in look'; for
^atto~ in this sense cp. Purg. xxiv. 27. 

	|65.  A terminar~, &c.: `to conduct you to the desired end
of your journey'; cp. ll. 94, 95. 

	|67-68.  terzo giro~, &c.: `the third circle starting from
the highest tier'; cp. Par. xxxii. 7-9. 

	|71-72.  si facea~, &c.: `was wearing a crown of light
formed by the rays which proceeded from God being reflected from
her head,' lit. `formed for herself a crown by reflecting,' &c. 
At this point, even more than elsewhere in the poem, we must bear
in mind that Beatrice represents Theology. 

	|73-75.  Da quella~, &c.: `from that part of the sky where 
the highest thunders roll.'  In order to give an idea of the 
inconceivable extent of the court of Heaven, and at the same time
of the exalted position of Beatrice, Dante says that the space 
which intervened between him and her exceeded the distance from
the depths of the sea to the highest region of our atmosphere. 
|Qualunque~, &c.: `the eye of him who suffers himself to sink 
into the lowest depths of the sea.'  For |s' abbandona~ see note
on Par. xvii. 108. 

	|77-78.  nulla mi facea~: `this affected me not,' i.e. made
no difference to me.  |per mezzo mista~: `obscured by any
medium,' such as our atmosphere. 

	|81.  In inferno~, &c.: cp. Inf. ii. 52 foll. `To leave thy
footprints in, means no more than `to visit.' 

	|82-84.  Di tante~, &c.: `I acknowledge as due to thy might
and goodness the grace and power, which have enabled me to see
ill the objects which I have beheld.' 

	|85-87.  di servo~, &c.: i.e. from the bondage of sin to the
glorious liberty of the children of God.  Dante's conversion and
ultimate salvation were the primary object of his journey through
the three realms of the spiritual world.  |Che di ci@o~, &c.: `of
which thou couldst avail thyself for that purpose.' 

	|88.  La tua~, &c.: `continue the bountyof thy goodness 
toward me.' 

	|92-93.  come parea~: take with si |lontana~; `distant in
appearance,' not in reality, because in the Empyrean space does
not exist.  |fontana~: God. 

	|96.  prego~: on the part of Beatrice. 

	|98-99.  t' acconcer@a~, &c.: `will qualify thy sight to
mount higher along the divine ray,' i.e. to approach nearer to
its source, the presence of God. 

	|104.  Veronica~: the likeness of our Lord's face, which 
according to the story was impressed on a napkin or handkerchief,
which was presented to Him that He might wipe the sweat from His
face, when He was on His way to crucifixion: cp. ^Vita Nuova~, 
{part} xli. ll. 3-5, `quella imagine benedetta, la quale Ges@u
Cristo lasci@o a noi per esempio della sua bellissima figura.' 
This ^sudario~, which is now preserved in St. Peter's at Rome,
was exhibited at the Jubilee in 1300 (Villani, viii. 36); and
this is no doubt the occasion here referred to.  Veronica is
another form of Berenice, the name of the woman who was supposed
to have presented the handkerchief to Christ. 

	|106.  fin che~, &c.: `so long as it is being exhibited'; 
for |fin che~ in this sense cp. Purg. xii. 3. 

	|111.  quella pace~: the peace of Heaven. 

	|112.  questo esser~: the life of the saints in Paradise. 

	|116.  la Regina~: the Blessed Virgin. 

	|121-123.  di valle~, &c.: i.e. raising my eyes from the
lower to the higher circles.  |vidi parte~, &c.: `I saw a portion
of Heaven on the utmost verge (i.e. in the highest and outermost
leaves of the Rose) surpassing in brightness all else that faced
me.' 

	|124-126.  E come~, &c.: `and as in that part of the sky
where we are looking for the sun to rise the brilliancy
increases, while on either side of this the light diminishes,'
i.e.  shades off, as is seen from ll. 128, 129, the point of
which is illustrated by this cornparison.  |il temo~, &c.: `the
car (lit. pole) of the sun, which Pha,ethon guided amiss.'  The
story of Pha,ethon is often referred to by Dante in the course of
the poem; cp. Inf. xvii. 107; Purg. iv. 72; xxix 118; Par. xvii.
3. 

	|127-129.  pacifica oriafiamma~: `oriflamme of peace,' in 
contrast with the warlike banner of the French kings which bore 
that name.  `So did that oriflamme of peace display a brighter 
light at its midpoint, and on either side (of that point) the 
brilliancy diminished in an equal degree.'  The `oriflamme' is 
the part of Heaven in which the Virgin was -- the ^parte~ of l. 
122; and the `mid-point' is the person of the Virgin herself. 

	|130-132.  a quel mezzo~: `at that mid-point,' i.e. in the
presence of the Virgin.  |Ciascun~, &c.: `each differing from the
other both in brightness and in forms of joy.'  |arte~ has been
explained in a variety of ways, but perhaps |festanti~ above
gives the clue to the interpretation, so that the meaning is
^arte di far festa~, lit. `skill in are mentioned in Par. xxix.
136-41. 

	|133-134.  Vidi~, &c.: `I beheld smiling on their sports and
songs a loveliness'; the beauty of the Virgin is meant. 

	|136-138.  s' io avessi~: `even if I had.'  |tentar~: `to try
to express.' 

	|140.  caldo suo calor~: `the object of his burning love';
cp. ll. 100, 101.
