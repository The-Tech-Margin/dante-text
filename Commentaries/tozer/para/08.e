	|1-12.~  In these lines it is said that the name of the
planet Venus was derived from that of the heathen goddess, and
that she was supposed to send forth from it the influences of
sensual love.  Dante himself believed that love was imparted to 
men by this planet, but through the agency of angels. 

	|1-3.  in suo periclo~: `to its peril,' because the sin 
which proceeded from this cause endangered the soul.  Others say
`in its time of peril,' i.e. in the time of heathenism, when 
there was no hope of salvation.  With this latter interpretation
^nell' antico errore~ in l. 6 is a repetition of the same idea. 
|Ciprigna~: Venus, the goddess of Cyprus, whose temple was at 
Paphos in that island.  |il folle~, &c.: `beamed forth delirious 
love.'  For |raggiasse~ cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 7. ll. 90-2, `li raggi 
di ciascuno cielo sono la via, per la quale discende la loro 
virt@u in queste cose di quaggi@u.'  |volta~, &c.: `revolving in
the third epicycle.'  The term `epicycle' means a circle, the 
centre of which is carried round upon another circle; cp. ^Conv.~
ii. 4. ll. 78-88.  To account for the apparent irregularities in
the orbits of the heavenly bodies which resulted from the view 
that they revolved round the earth which was stationary, Ptolemy
suggested that each planet moved in such a circle of its own in 
addition to the revolution of the sphere to which it belonged. 
In the case of Venus this is called the third epicycle, because 
the sphere of Venus is the third in order in the heavens. 

	|6.  antico errore~: the errors of heathenism. 

	|9.  ei sedette~: Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 715-9; Dido's passion is
introduced as a typical instance of Cupid's supposed influence. 

	|10-12.  costei~, &c.: Venus, with whom the Canto commences. 
|Pigliavano~, &c.: `they derived the name of the star that courts
the sun, now following, now in front'; i.e. is in attendance on
the sun, sometimes as the evening star, sometimes as the morning
star.  |coppa~: `back of the head.' 

	|15.  ch' io vidi far~: `whom I saw become,' |far~ for
^farsi.~ 

	|16-18.  E come~, &c.: in both these similes the point is 
the rapid movement of one object within the other which is at 
rest.  |@e ferma~: `holds the note.' 

	|19-21.  essa luce~: the planet Venus.  |Al modo~, &c.: `in
proportion to (according to the measure of) their eternal powers
of vision.'  |eterne~: `eternal,' as distinguished from temporal. 
If ^interne~ is read, it means `inner,' i.e. spiritual. 

	|23.  O visibili o no~: this means `either in the form of 
lightning or in that of hurricane.'  Dante's authority here is 
Aristotle, who held lightning to be simply wind rendered visible
by ignition; cp. ^Meteorol.~ iii. 1. 6, in which passage cold 
as the origin of these phenomena, and their downward movement 
from the cloud from which they proceed, are noticed; cp. ^Di 
fredda nube~ and ^disceser~ in l. 22.  See Moore, ^Studies~, i. 
p. 133. 

	|26-27.  il giro~, &c.: `the dance, which they had 
previously commenced in the company of the exalted Seraphim.' 
The |giro~ is that which is mentioned in l. 20.  The spirits, 
before they descended to the Heaven of Venus to speak with Dante,
were engaged in this dance together with the Seraphim in the 
Empyrean; cp. Par. ix. 76-8, where their singing in harmony with
the Seraphim is spoken of. 

	|28-29.  E dentro~, &c.: `and among the foremost who
revealed themselves Hosanna was heard in such tones,' &c. 

	|33.  perch@e~, &c.: `that you may win joy from us.' 

	|34-35.  principi~: these are the Principalities, as the 
Order of angels is called, who preside over the Heaven of Venus 
as Motors (cp. Par. ii. 129) or Intelligences.  In ^Conv.~ ii. 6. 
l. 109 Dante makes the Thrones the Motors of this Heaven, but
this view he now alters.  For the succession of the angelic 
hierarchies, and their correspondence to the nine spheres of 
Heaven, see Prefatory Note to Canto I.  |D' un giro~, &c.: the 
movement of the spirits corresponds to that of the Intelligences
which guide them, (1) in respect of its circular form (|D' un 
giro~); (2) in respect of its eternity (|d' un girare~); (3) in 
respect of its intensity, which is caused by its longing (|sete~)
for the presence of God. 

	|36-37.  del mondo~: `when on earth,' `as a citizen of 
earth.'  |Voi che~, &c.: `Ye who by your intelligence move the 
third Heaven.'  This is the first line of the first Canzone of 
the ^Convito~; Dante explains its meaning in ^Conv.~ ii. 6. ll. 
151-61. 

	|39.  un poco di quiete~: `a brief repose from our 
movement.' 

	|42.  di s@e~, &c.: `satisfied and confident of her 
approbation.'  It is to be observed that, whenever any 
theological truths are communicated to Dante by other spirits, 
the permission of Beatrice as representing Theology is required. 

	|43-45.  promessa~, &c.: see ll. 32, 33.  |chi siete~: `who
you, the occupants of this sphere, are.' |La voce mia~, &c.: `the
words I uttered, bearing the stamp of deep feeling'; this feeling
was caused by the spirit having shown that he was acquainted with
him by quoting from one of his poems. 

	|46.  E quanta~, &c.: the light of joy which emanated 
from the spirit (see ll. 52, 53) caused it to increase (|far 
pi@ue~) in size (|quanta~) and in brightness (|quale~).  |far^
for ^farsi~, as in l. 15. 

	|49.  Cosi fatta~: `in such semblance.'  |mi disse~: the 
speaker is Carlo Martello, eldest son of Charles II of Anjou, 
king of Naples.  He married Clemence, daughter of Rudolf of 
Hapsburg.  In 1294 he visited Florence, and he probably met Dante
on that occasion.  He died in 1295, aged 24. 

	|51.  Molto~, &c.: this stands for ^Molto di mal che sar@a
non sarebbe stato.~  The evils here referred to are the
disastrous state of the kingdom of Naples under his younger 
brother Robert. 

	|52-54.  celato~: the brightness which conceals this spirit
from Dante, it should be observed, was temporary, for it was
caused by its pleasure; under other circumstances it would have
been seen in its human form, like those in the two lower spheres;
see notes on Par. iii. 47-9; v. 107, 108.  |animal~, &c.: the
silkworm in its cocoon. 

	|55-57.  Assai~, &c.: the position, character, and 
prospects of Carlo Martello seem to have made a great impression
on Dante, and caused him to regard him as an ideal personage. 
This view is confirmed by Carlo saying in what follows that, had
he lived, he would have justified Dante's hopes in him. 
|mostrava~: irregular sequence of the indic. after |s' io fossi~;
cp. Par. vii. 118-20: strictly the meaning is -- `I was intending
to show you -- and should have shown you, had I remained on earth
below.'  |pi@u oltre~, &c.: `not merely the promise of fruit, but
the fruits themselves.' 

	|58-60.~  The passage that follows, down to l. 70, which 
describes the countries which Carlo Martello either ruled or had
the prospect of ruling, illustrates Dante's love of descriptive 
and political geography, i.e. the features and boundaries of 
countries.  |Quella~, &c.: the country on the left or eastern 
bank of the Rhone, below the junction of the Sorgue with that 
river above Avignon, was the `gran dote Provenzale' of Purg. xx.
61 -- embracing Avignon Arles, Marseilles, and Aix -- which 
Charles of Anjou obtained by his marriage with the daughter of 
Raymond Berenger, and to which Carlo Martello would have 
succeeded on the death of Charles II in 1309.  |a tempo~: `at the
fitting time.' 

	|61-63.  quel corno~, &c.: `that horn (i.e. projecting part)
of Italy, which embraces the towns of,' &c.  The kingdom of 
Apulia, which Carlo would have inherited from his father, is here
accurately described, for Bari lies on the Adriatic coast, Ga,eta
on the western shore, and the small town of Catona on the Straits
of Messina to the northward of Reggio; while the Tronto, which 
flows into the Adriatic below Ascoli, forms the northern limit on
one side, and the Verde -- i.e. the Garigliano under a 
different name -- on the other. 

	|64-66.  Fulgeami~, &c.: Carlo inherited the kingdom of 
Hungary through his mother, and was crowned king in 1290, but he
never was more than a titular sovereign.  |Poi che~, &c.: this 
means that Hungary was lower down the course of the Danube than 
Germany. 

	|67-70.  Trinacria~: one of the classical names of Sicily. 
The reason of its use here is, that `king of Trinacria' was the
recognized title of Frederic II, the present ruler of that island
(1296-1337), because `king of Sicily' would have implied
sovereignty over the two Sicilies; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 537. 
|che caliga~, &c.: ` which is darkened (overshadowed with
clouds)...not (as the fable tells) by the agency of the giant
Typhoeus, but by that of nascent sulphur.'  The reference is to
the clouds of sulphureous vapour which hang about the summit of
Etna, under which mountain the giant Typhoeus was said to have 
been placed by Jupiter; cp. Ov. ^Met.~ v. 346-55, from which 
passage the names here given are taken.  There is something 
unusual in Dante's thus refuting an old fable by assigning a 
natural cause to the phenomenon.  The explanation of this may 
perhaps be found in a passage of Isidore, one of Dante's 
authorities (^Orig.~ xiv. 8), where the volcanic fires of Etna 
are attributed to sulphur which is ignited by currents of air 
driven by the force of the waves through caves in the side of the
mountain.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 525.  |Tra Pachino~, &c.: 
this and the following line describe the eastern coast of Sicily,
with its slightly concave outline (|il golfo~), and the headlands
of Pachynus and Pelorum at its southern and northern extremities.
|Che riceve~, &c.: `which is most exposed to the onset of Eurus 
(the east wind).' 

	|71-72.  Attesi~, &c.: `would still have been looking 
forward to her succession of kings, descended through me from 
Charles of Anjou (my father) and from Rudolf of Hapsburg (my 
father-in-law).' 

	|73-75.  Se mala~, &c.: `had not tyranny (lit. bad 
government), which ever rouses to fury subject peoples, moved the
Palermitans to cry "Do them to death."'  The massacre of the 
French at the time of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 is meant. 

	|76-78.  E se~, &c.: `and if my brother could foresee this 
(viz. the fatal results of tyranny in his own case), he would at
the present time (in 1300) shrink from employing the greedy 
poverty of the Catalans (the needy and grasping followers whom he
had brought with him from Catalonia), that it might not injure 
his cause.'  The brother here mentioned is Robert, who with two 
others was left in Spain as hostages for Charles II from 1288-95
(cp. Purg. xx. 79); and |L' avara povert@a~, &c., refers to the 
associates whom he brought from that country in 1295, and the 
Catalan mercenaries employed by him, whose greed and violence 
exasperated the subject population of the kingdom of Naples.  |Se
questo antivedesse~ is a prophetic anticipation on Carlo
Martello's part, since Robert did not come to the throne till
1309. 

	|79-81.  Ch@e veramente~, &c.: `for verily there is good 
need that he should make provision, either himself or by the aid
of others, so that an additional freight may not be placed on his
bark which is already heavily freighted.'  |sua barca~ means the 
kingdom of Naples, and the clause |s@i che~, &c., must be taken 
as referring entirely to the future; `so that, when at a later 
time he enters on his kingdom already overtaxed, a still heavier
burden may not be laid upon it.'  For ^barca~ in the sense of the
`vessel' of the state or commonwealth cp. Par. xvi. 96. 

	|82-84.  che di larga~, &c.: `which, being itself 
avaricious, descended from one that was liberal.' In Par. xix.
128 Dante implies that his father, Charles II, possessed the one
virtue of generosity.  |avria mestier~, &c.: `would need such 
officials as would not be anxious to hoard,' i.e. being 
avaricious himself he should not make matters worse by employing
avaricious subordinates.  |milizia~ perhaps has a special 
reference to the Catalan soldiers who were in his service. 

	|85-90.~  These lines are intended to signify Dante's 
inability fully to express his thanks in words.  In default of 
this, he declares his pleasure at feeling that Carlo -- who, like
the other spirits in Paradise, can read the thoughts of others in
the face of God -- is aware both of his sentiments themselves, 
and of Dante's knowledge that he (Carlo) is cognizant of them. 
`Inasmuch as I believe that thou seest in the face of God, who is
the source and aim of all good, as fully as I myself am conscious
of it, the joy which thy words communicate to me, my lord, my joy
is increased; and this also delights me, that thou seest in God 
that I believe it' (|il~ = ^ch' io credo~, &c.).  For the use 
of |Perch@e~ meaning `that' cp. Purg. vi. 88. 

	|93.  Come~, &c.: the question how it comes to pass that a
bad son can be born of a good father is started in Dante's mind 
by the remark concerning Robert in ll. 82, 83, `di larga parca 
Discese.' 

	|94-96.  S' io posso~, &c.: `if I can make clear to thee a 
certain truth, thou wilt see the solution of thy difficulty as 
manifestly as now it is hidden from thee.'  The `truth' is the 
operation of God's providence through the influences of the stars
in directing and modifying the order of nature.  This having been
established, Carlo proceeds to show how by this means variety is
introduced into the characters and lives of men, which variety is
the basis of social life. 

	|97-111.~  The argument is as follows: -- God, in creating
the universe, provided not only for the existence of things, but
for their working in the most perfect manner; and the
instrumentality which He appointed for that purpose was the
stellar influences, which are directed by the angels or 
Intelligences who preside over them: Were it not for these, chaos
and not order would prevail. 

	|98-99.  Volge e contenta~: `causes to revolve and to be 
satisfied.'  |fa esser~, &c.: `makes his providence to be an 
active power in these mighty (i.e. heavenly) bodies,' the 
planets. 

	|100-102.  E non pur~, &c.: `and not only are the things 
in themselves (|le nature~) provided in the mind of God, but 
along with them all that is necessary to their performing their 
functions rightly' (|la lor salute~, lit. `that which safeguards 
them'). 

	|103-105.  Perch@e~, &c.: `wherefore everything that is 
discharged from this bow (from the stellar influences) descends 
ordained to (accomplish) a foreseen purpose, like a thing (a 
shaft) directed to its mark.'  |quantunque~ is used here and 
elsewhere in the Paradiso for `all that,' Lat. ^quantumcunque.~ 

	|106-108.  Se ci@o~, &c.: `were it not that a divine 
purpose runs through all creation, the effect of the working of 
the spheres (lit. of the Heaven through which you are journeying)
would be to produce, not a perfect scheme, but a chaos.' 

	|109-111.  E ci@o~, &c.: `and that cannot be, unless we 
are to suppose (that which is impossible) that the Intelligences
which direct these spheres are defective, and also the great 
First Cause, who (on that supposition) has not created them 
perfect.'  |perfetti~: for ^perfezionati~, being adapted from 
the Lat. particip. ^perfectus.~ 

	|112-114.  s' imbianchi~: `should be rendered clear.' |Che 
la natura~, &c.: `that nature should tire (fall shod) in 
providing all that is necessary' for the order and perfect 
working of the universe; cp. ^De Mon.~ i. 10. ll. 4, 5, `quum
Deus et natura in necessariis non deficiat.'  By ^natura~ Dante
generally means the working of the stellar influences; cp. ^De
Mon.~ ii. 2. ll. 36-8, `a caelo, quod organum est artis divinae,
quam Naturam communiter appellant.' 

	|115-135.  Ond' egli~, &c.: having established his primary 
proposition, Carlo goes on to say that man is a social being, and
in order for society to exist it is necessary that various 
functions should be performed; and for this purpose men of 
different characters and abilities are required.  These 
differences could not be produced by the ordinary process of 
generation of son from father, but are introduced by the stellar
influences. 

	|118-120.  E pu@o~, &c.: `can men exist in society, unless 
on earth there are various modes of life in various functions?' 
|il maestro~: Aristotle, `il Maestro di color che sanno,' Inf. 
iv. 131.  The passage here referred to is Pol. ii. 2. 3,

%alpha%nu%theta%rho%omega%pi%omicron%sigma\ are commonplaces of
that writer. 

	|121-123.  venne deducendo~: `he proceeded by inference.' 
|Dunque~, &c.: `consequently the roots from which your operations
arise (i.e. the elements of character) must needs be diverse.' 

	|124-126.  Per che~, &c.: `for this reason one is born to 
be a lawgiver, another to be a warrior, another a priest, another
a craftsman.'  |quello~, &c.: Daedalus, the typical artificer. 
The story of the flight of Daedalus and his son Icarus is 
referred to in Inf. xvii. 109-11. 

	|127-129.  La circular natura~, &c.: `the nature of the 
revolving spheres, which, like a seal on wax, imprints itself on
mankind, exercises its art well, but does not distinguish one 
house from another.'  In other words: -- The stellar influences 
produce individuality of character in men, but do not favour one
family more than another by perpetuating excellence in it.  Dante
is returning to the question, How can a bad son proceed from a 
good father? 

	|130-132.  Quinci~, &c.: `hence, as these influences operate
independently of such limitations, two brothers, like Esau and
Jacob, may differ in character, and a great king, like Romulus,
may be sprung from a mean father.'  |Per seme~: `by birth,' i.e.
in his inborn character.  |si rende~, &c.: `he is attributed to
Mars'; his successors, to conceal the meanness of his origin,
said that Mars was his father: cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 273, `regina
sacerdos Marte gravis,' &c. 

	|133-135.  Natura~, &c.: `were it not for the interposition
of divine providence (operating through the stars), the nature 
(i.e. character and ability) of the son would always follow the 
same course as that of the parents.' 

	|136-138.  retro~: cp. ll.~95, 96.  |mi giova~: here used 
impers.; `that I have pleasure in thee'; cp. Par. ix. 24. 
|corollario~: `corollary' or supplementary statement; cp. Purg. 
xxviii. 136.  |t' ammanti~: `take to thyself,' lit. `invest 
thyself with.' 

	|139-141.  Sempre~, &c.: the corollary here is a practical 
lesson, to the effect that persons should not be forced into 
professions for which they are by nature ill-suited.  `Ever doth 
nature, when placed in circumstances unsuitable to it, fail to 
prosper, like any other seed, when out of its habitual soil and 
climate.' 

	|143.  Al fondamento~, &c.: `to the foundation laid by 
nature,' i.e. the gifts and character implanted in men. 

	|145-148.  torcete~, &c.: `ye pervert from its natural bent
to the service of religion.'  |da sermone~: `suited to the 
pulpit.'  Carlo is thought to be here alluding to his two 
brothers -- Louis, who became a Franciscan and was made Bishop of
Toulouse; and Robert, king of Naples, who took pleasure in 
composing sermons; some of these have been preserved and 
published (by D' Ancona).  |la traccia~, &c.: `your course 
misses the right road.'
