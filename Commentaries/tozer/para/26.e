	|3.  spiro~: `voice'; cp. Par. xxiv. 32.  St. John is
speaking. 

	|4-6.  ti risense~: `regain the sense.'  |risense~ for 
^risensi.~  |che bai~, &c.: `which thou hast extinguished by 
looking at me.'  |Ben @e~, &c.: `it is well that by conversing 
with me thou shouldst compensate (make up to thyself) for the 
loss of sight.' 

	|7-8.  s' appunta~: `aims.'  St. John here commences his 
examination of Dante on the subject of Love, and asks him the 
question, `On what object is the desire of thy soul fixed?' 
Dante replies, `On God.'  |fa ragion~: `be sure,' lit.
`consider'; cp. Inf. xxx. 145. 

	|12.  La virt@u~, &c.: the power of restoring sight, which
Ananias exercised in curing St: Paul's blindness; Acts ix. 17,
18.  Allegorically: -- When the mind has been dazzled, as Dante's
had been (see note on Par. xxv. 122) by investigating too deeply
a theological question, relief is to be found in the teaching of
true theology, as represented by Beatrice. 

	|15.  foco~: Dante's love for Beatrice. 

	|16-18.  Lo ben~, &c.: Dante's answer to the question, 
`What is the chief desire of thy soul?' is, `God is the beginning
and the end of every precept (|scrittura~) that love teaches me, 
whether gently or forcibly,' i.e. of all the lessons of love, 
whether in its lighter or its deeper forms.  But |di quanta 
scrittura~, &c., may equally well be taken as `of all my 
impressions (of love), which Love recalls (lit. recites to me) in
loud or low tones.'  With the latter interpretation, |scrittura~
is the record of love impressed on Dante's heart or memory; Love
reciting it to him means his feelings recalling it; and `in loud
or low tones' implies the varying force of the emotion excited. 
|Alfa ed O~: cp. Rev. xxii. 13, `I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, the first and the last.'  ^Alfa ed Omega~
is also read, but this reading seems to have arisen from the 
desire to avoid the metrical ^hiatus~ after |Alfa~, and from the
apparent strangeness of the use of the letter |O~ in conjunction
with the full form |Alfa.~  In mediaeval Latin hymns, however, 
^Alpha et O~ is not uncommonly found; thus in Mone's ^Hymni 
Latini medii aevi~ the following instances occur, the MSS. in 
which they are found being of the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries: -- (1) `Alpha et O quem dicimus' (vol. i. p. 10); (2)
`Alpha et %omega\, magne Deus, / Heli heli Deus meus' (vol. i. 
p. 14~; (3) `Alpha et %omega\ suum / Misit archangelum' (vol. 
ii. p. 68); (4) `Alpha et %omega\ nominate' (vol. ii. p. 449):
The ^hiatus~ after |Alfa~ is allowable because it is a Greek
word; for similar non-elisions of final vowels of Latin words cp.
Purg. ii. 46; x. 44; xx. 136. 

	|21.  mi mise in cura~: `inspired me with the desire.' 

	|22-24.  a pi@u~, &c.: `to explain thy views by the use of 
a finer sieve,' i.e. by entering into greater detail.  |Chi 
drizz@o~, &c.: who caused thee to aim at such a target,' i.e. to
fix thy affections on God. 

	|25-27.  Ed io~, &c.: Dante's proofs that God is the highest
aim and object of love are derived (1) from the deductions of
human Reason, (2) from the authority of Revelation.  The former
of these proofs is treated of in ll. 28-39, the latter in ll.
40-5.  |Cotale amor~, &c.: `the love of God must needs impress
itself on me,' i.e. make its claims felt. 

	|28-36.~  The argument derived from Reason is this: -- That
which is good awakens love in the soul of him who understands its
nature, and the love increases in proportion as the goodness is
greater.  Consequently the Being who is perfect goodness must
attract more love than any other object. 

	|28.  in quanto ben~: `inasmuch as it is good,' and not by
means of any other attribute.  |come s' intende~: `as soon as 
its nature is perceived.' 

	|31-36.  Dunque~, &c.: `consequently the mind of every one 
who perceives the truth on which this proof is based (viz. the 
principle that God is the highest good) cannot fail to be moved 
in love towards the essence, in which there is such supreme 
perfection, that every good which is external to it is naught 
else than a reflexion of its light, rather than towards any other
essence.' 

	|37-39.  Tal vero~, &c.: `this truth (viz. that God is the 
highest good) is set forth (lit. laid down) to my intellect by 
him, who shows me what is the primal object of love to all the 
eternal substances.'  Aristotle is meant, who taught that God is 
the power which attracts all things to itself by their desire for
it, and thus causes the movement of the universe; cp. Ar.

%omicron%upsilon%sigma%alpha\ (^Metaph.~ xi. 8. 5). 

	|40-42.~  As proofs from Revelation Dante adduces two 
passages, one from the Old and one from the New Testament. 
|verace autore~: the `truthful Author' is God himself, who says 
to Moses (Exod. xxxiii. 19), `I will make all my goodness pass 
before thee'; in the Vulgate this is -- `Ego ostendam omne bonum
tibi,' where `omne bonum' corresponds to Dante's |ogni valore~, 
and is taken to imply that all good is summed up in God. 

	|43-45.  Sternilmi~, &c.: `thou too dost set it forth, at 
the beginning of thy sublime announcement, which beyond every 
other proclamation declares on earth the secret of Heaven.'  St.
John's `announcement of the secret of Heaven' is the Book of 
Revelation, of the very name of which these words seem almost to
be a paraphrase; and the passage at its commencement which is 
here referred to can only be Rev. i. 8, `I am Alpha and Omega the
beginning and the ending, saith the Lord which is, and which was,
and which is to come the Almighty' Since however this passage as
it stands makes no reference to God as the highest goodness or as
the object of love, we must suppose that one or both of these 
aspects is to be understood as implied in the character of God as
the supreme Deity.  |bando~: for the use of this word in the 
sense of `proclamation' cp. `novissimo bando,' Purg. xxx. 13, of
the summons to the Last Judgement. 

	|46-48.  Per intelletto~, &c.: `in accordance with the 
arguments which you have mentioned, viz. those derived from 
Reason, and those from Revelation which accord with Reason, the 
highest of your affections is directed (lit. looks) towards God.'
This sentence conveys St. John's approbation of Dante's answer. 

	|49-51.  corde~: `inducements'; these, as we see from
Dante's answer (ll. 58 foll.), are the evidences of God;s love. 
|che tu suone~, &c.: `that thou mayest declare how many reasons 
compel thee to love God.' 

	|53.  aquila~: St. John, whose emblem is the eagle. 

	|55-57.  morsi~: here used for `impulses,' `urgent reasons';
cp. ^morde~ in l. 51.  |Alla mia~, &c.: `have co-operated to
produce my love.' 

	|58-61.  l' essere~, &c.: `the existence of the world'; in
other words, its creation.  |quel che spera~, &c.: the
Christian's hope of future reward.  |conoscenza~: the knowledge 
of God as the highest good.  |predetta~: cp. ll. 28 foll. 

	|64-66.  Le fronde~: mankind.  They are mentioned, because 
the love of them necessarily follows on the love of God. 
|cotanto~, &c.: `in proportion to the good gifts which he has 
bestowed upon them.'  |porto~: part. from ^porgere.~ 

	|70-77.  E come~, &c.: Beatrice now exercises the power
which St. John had attributed to her (ll. 10-2) of restoring
Dante's sight by a look, after he had been blinded by gazing at 
that Saint.  In the simile Dante's condition is compared to that
of a man who is dazed through being awakened from sleep by a 
brilliant light falling on his eyes; and his recovery by Beatrice
is likened to the restoration of such a man to clear 
consciousness by the power of reflexion, which explains to him 
what has happened. 

	|71-72.  Per lo spirto~, &c.: `owing to the visual power 
turning towards the bright light which passes from one to another
of the coats (i.e. membranes) of the eye.'  By |spirto visivo~ --
or, as Dante elsewhere calls it, ^spiriti visivi~ (Par. xxx. 47),
^spiriti del viso~ (^Vita Nuova~, {part} 14. l. 39) -- is meant
the current that passes from the eye to the brain. 

	|73-75.  abborre~: `shrinks from'; this is the effect of 
being dazed by the sudden light.  |Si nescia~, &c.: so
unconscious is he, when thus suddenly awakened, so long as his 
power of reflexion fails to come to his aid.'

	|76-78.  ogni quisquilia~: `every mote,' lit. `impurity.' 
|da pi@u~, &c.: the meaning is, that the light of Beatrice's eyes
shone to a great distance.

	|83-84.  Vagheggia~, &c.: `the first soul (Adam) which the
primal Virtue (God) ever created, gazes on its Maker.' 

	|87.  la sublima~: `inclines it upward.' 

	|89.  Stupendo~: gerund from ^stupire~, `through amazement.'
|mi rifece sicuro~: `restored my confidence.' 

	|91-93.  maturo~: `mature,' in the sense of `full-grown.' 
|A cui~, &c.: this is another way of saying that every woman and
every man is a descendant of Adam. 

	|95-96.  mia voglia~: i.e. my desire of an answer to certain
questions; these questions are stated in ll. 109-14.  |per
udirti~, &c.: Dante desires to avoid delaying the answers by 
asking the questions. 

	|97-102.~  Adam's joy in answering Dante's questions is 
manifested by the increased brightness of his envelope of light.
This is compared to the motions by which an animal expresses its
feelings being traceable in the movement of a cloth which is
wrapped round it.  The simile is quaint, to say the least,
especially when we consider the connexion in which it occurs; but
it does not stand alone in this respect in this part of the poem,
since Dante, for reasons of his own, has introduced into the 
Paradiso some of the homeliest of his comparisons.  Such are (1)
the sound proceeding from the wind-hole of a reed-pipe (Par. xx.
23, 24), which is used to describe the voice emitted by the eagle
in the Heaven of Jupiter; (2) rowers stopping their oars at the 
sound of the boatswain's whistle (Par. xxv. 133-5), to illustrate
the cessation from singing on the part of the chorus of spirits
when they hear the voice of St. John; and (3) the prudent tailor,
who cuts his coat according to his cloth (Par. xxxii: 139-41), to
whose example St. Bernard appeals, when he cuts short his
enumeration of the saints in the Empyrean because she time
allotted to Dante for his Vision is drawing to a close. 

	|97-99.  coperto~: `within a wrapping.'  |broglia~: `moves 
about, `wriggles.'  The word is connected with Fr. ^brouiller~
and is the origin of Engl. ^imbroglio.~  |Per lo seguir~, &c: 
`because the covering follows its movements.' 

	|102.  venia gaia~: `was gladdened,' lit. `became glad.' 
For the use of ^venire~ with adjectives in the sense of
^divenire~ cp. Par. xxxiii. 52, `venendo sincera.' 

	|104.  Da te~: Witte reads ^Dante~, but we may confidently
say that this reading is inadmissible, because the Poet implies
in Purg. xxx. 62, 63 that he never introduces his name except
where this is unavoidable, which is not the case here. 

	|106-108.  Perch' io~, &c.: this difficult passage is 
rendered more perplexing by a variety of readings in l. 107. 
Among these the reading of the Oxford text, |Che fa di s@e 
pareglio all' altre cose~, seems to be the best suited to the 
context.  Adam has just told Dante, that he is aware of his 
wishes with a certainty beyond what his (Dante's) mind is capable
of attaining to.  In explanation of this he adds: -- `I see those
wishes depicted in the mind of God, in which, as in a faithful 
mirror, the thoughts of His creatures are reflected; whereas 
their minds (and therefore your mind) cannot know what is passing
in the mind of God, so that you cannot reach the same certainty.'
According to this interpretation |pareglio~ is a substantive, 
meaning a `parhelion' or mock-sun; from which sense -- as a 
parhelion is a reflected or refracted image of the sun -- it is 
taken to signify simply a `reflexion.'  The literal translation,
then, of ll. 107, 108 will be -- `who makes himself the reflexion
of (i.e. in him are reflected) the other things (and, in
particular, men's minds), while none of them makes itself a 
reflexion of him (his thoughts are not reflected in their
minds).'  |Lui~ here stands for ^a lui~, as elsewhere in Dante,
e.g. Inf. xxviii. 48.  The introduction of the parhelion as an 
object of comparison need not excite surprise, for Dante was a 
curious observer of meteorological phenomena, as his similes, 
especially in the Paradiso, show; and he would be acquainted with
parhelia through Aristotle, who mentions them in his 
^Meteorologica~ (iii. 2. 6; 6. 1 foll.).  Another reading -- 
between which and that just mentioned there does not seem to be 
much to choose as regards the authority of the MSS. -- is 
^pareglio l' altre cose.~  The interpretation here is easier, 
though the meaning obtained is less apposite.  Longfellow, who 
adopts this, translates thus: -- `For I behold it in the truthful
mirror, That of Himself all things parhelion makes, And none 
makes Him parhelion of itself.'  (^Lui~ here is accus.) In his 
note he says -- `Parhelion is an imperfect image of the sun, 
formed by reflexion in the clouds.  All things are such faint 
reflexions of the Creator; but He is the reflexion of none of 
them.'  A third reading is ^pareglie l' altre cose.~  Here 
^pareglie~ is taken as an adj. agreeing with ^cose~, and meaning
`equal,' `like'; and ^di s@e~ depends upon it.  `Who makes the 
other things to resemble himself, while none of them makes him to
resemble itself.'  But this reading is evidently a ^lectio
facilior~, and it is hard to see how the other readings could
have arisen from it. 

	|109-111.  quant' @e che~: `howlong a time it is since.' 
|giardino~: the Earthly Paradise.  |ove costei~, &c.: `where 
Beatrice prepared thee for the long ascent through the spheres of
Heaven.' 

	|112-113.  E quanto~, &c.: `and how long it (the Earthly
Paradise) was a delight to my eyes'; |quanto~ is for ^quanto
tempo~, as in l. 109.  |gran disdegno~: God's wrath against
Adam's transgression; this is another way of saying `the Fall of
Man.' 

	|115-142.~  Of Dante's four questions which have just been 
stated, Adam answers first No. 3 -- `What was the real cause of 
the Fall of Man?' (ll. 115-7); next No. 1 -- `How long time had 
elapsed from the Creation to the present moment?' (ll. 118-23); 
then No. 4 -- `What language did Adam speak?' (ll. 124-38); and 
finally No. 2 -- `How long time did he spend in the Earthly 
Paradise?' (ll. 139-42). 

	|117.  il trapassar del segno~: `overstepping the appointed
bounds,' lit. `passing the mark.'  This means, not merely the
transgression of God's commandment, but the desire of our first
parents to be as gods in knowing good and evil (Gen. iii. 5).  So
Aquinas says (^Summa~, ii. 2d+ae~. Q. 163. Art. 1), `Primum
peccatum hominis fuit in hoc, quod appetiit quoddam spirituale
bonum ^supra suam mensuram~'; and again in Art. 2, `Primus homo
peccavit principaliter appetendo similitudinem Dei quantum ad
scientiam boni et mali.' 

	|118-123.~  Adaa here says that he lived on earth 930 years
(cp. Gen. v. 5), and was in Limbo, until he was released by
Christ, 4302 years, which periods together make 5232 years.  In
order to answer Dante's question completely -- i.e. to compute
the time up to the date of Dante's Vision -- it would be
necessary to add the period which intervened between the death of
Christ in 34 A.D. (at which time He descended into Hell and 
delivered Adam) and 1300 A.D., viz. 1266 years.  Thus the total 
would be 6498 years.  Our authority for the duration of our
Lord's life halving been according to Dante 34 years is ^Conv.~ 
iv. 23. ll. 95-8, `Il nostro Salvatore Cristo, il quale volle 
morire nel trentaquattresimo anno della sua etade.' 

	|118-120.  Quindi~, &c.: `from that place, whence thy Lady 
urged Virgil to come, for four thousand three hundred and two 
revolutions of the sun I longed for this assembly,' i.e. the 
assembly of the saints in Heaven.  The place here meant is Limbo;
cp. Inf. ii. 52 foll.  |Quindi~ is to be taken with |desiderai.~ 

	|121-122.  i lumi~, &c.: `the lights of the sun's highway'
are the constellations of the zodiac; and the sun's returning to
all those lights marks the period of a year. 

	|124-126.  La lingua~, &c.: on the subject of the language 
which Adam used, Dante in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 6. ll. 59-61 had 
enunciated the view that it was Hebrew.  Further reflexion on the
constant change which is taking place in language had led him to
a contrary view (^inf.~ ll. 137, 138); and he here states his 
belief that Adam's language had ceased to exist even before the 
Confusion of Tongues.  |inconsumabile~: `which could not be 
completed'; the Tower of Babel was intended to reach up to 
Heaven.  |Nembrot~: for the idea on Dante's part that the Tower 
of Babel was built by Nimrod, see note on Inf. xxxi. 77. 

	|127-129.  Ch@e nullo~, &c.: `for, owing to the changes in 
men's inclinations under the influence of the stars, no product 
of human reason (such as language) ever remained permanently the
same.'  |rinnovella~ here = ^si cangia.~ 

	|130-132.  Opera~, &c.: `human language is an operation of 
nature; but nature leaves it to you to determine according to
your pleasure the particular form it takes.'  This point is
treated by Dante in connexion with the Italian dialects in ^De
Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 9. 44-60.  |abbella~: `it seems fair,' `pleases':
the word seems to be derived from the Proven$cal; cp. `Tan m'
abelis' in Purg. xxvi.  140.

	|133-135.~  To illustrate the natural change of language the
change in the name for God is introduced.  |infernale ambascia~:
`the anguish of Hell'; cp. Purg. xvi. 39.  |I~: this probably
stands for Jah or Jehovah.  |onde~, &c.: `from whom proceeds the
joy which enwraps me,' i.e. the enveloping robe of light. 

	|136-138.  El si chiam@o da poi~: the passage of Scripture 
which Dante seems to have had in his mind in this connexion is 
Ex. vi. 2, 3, `And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am 
Jehovah: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,
as God Almighty (^El Shaddai~), but by my name Jehovah I was not
known to them.'  Dante supposes that Adam in the state of
innocence would know God by His true and highest name, whereas 
afterwards this was replaced by the lower name.  Here again he is
correcting a statement of his own in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 4.
ll. 26-9), where he had said that the first word which man
uttered was ^El.~  |ci@o conviene~: `that is meet,' viz. the 
change from ^I~ to ^El.~  |l' uso~, &c.: Horace, ^Ars Poet.~
60-2, `Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos, Prima cadunt: 
ita verborum vetus interit aetas, Et iuvenum ritu florent modo 
nata vigentque.' 

	|139-142.  monte~: the Mountain of Purgatory, on the summit
of which was the Earthly Paradise.  |si leva pi@u~: cp. Purg.
iii. 14, 15.  |pura e disonesta~: i.e. both before and at the
time of the Fall.  |Dalla prim' ora~, &c.: `from the first hour
to the seventh (that which follows the sixth).'  Adam here
answers the second question by saying that the duration of his
stay in the Earthly Paradise was seven hours; to this effect 
there was a mediaeval tradition.  |Come~, &c.: `when the sun
changes from one quadrant to another.'  As a quadrant represents
a fourth part of the sun's daily course, the sun changes
quadrants every sixth hour; hence the meaning is, `when the sun 
has completed a quarter of its revolution.'  At that time the 
sixth hour is succeeded by the seventh.
