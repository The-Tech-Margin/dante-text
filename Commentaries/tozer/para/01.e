PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S CONCEPTION OF HEAVEN. 

	ACCORDING to Dante's system there are ten Heavens, forming
concentric spheres, all of which, with the exception of the tenth
or outermost, revolve round the earth, which is at the centre and
is stationary.  Between the earth and the first of these Heavens
the spheres of air and of fire intervene.  The velocity of the
movement of the spheres increases in proportion to their distance
from the earth.  This system is based in the main on that of
Ptolemy, whose astronomical views were known to Dante through the
^Elementa Astronomica~ of Alfraganus (Alfergan), the Arabian
astronomer of Cent. ix., which is an epitome of Ptolemy's work. 
Further, in accordance with the views of mediaeval theology,
Dante represents each of the first nine Heavens as being
regulated by one of the Angelic Orders, and as exercising under
their guidance a special influence on the earth and its
inhabitants.  In the first Heaven, that of the Moon, which is
directed by Angels, are seen the spirits of those who failed to
keep their monastic vows.  In the second, that of Mercury, which
is directed by Archangels, are the spirits of those who were
incited to noble deeds by the desire of fame.  In the third, that
of Venus, which is directed by Principalities, are the spirits of
lovers.  In the fourth, that of the Sun, which is directed by
Powers, are the spirits of the theologians.  In the fifth, that
of Mars, which is directed by Virtues, are the spirits of martyrs
and of warrior saints.  In the sixth, that of Jupiter, which is
directed by Dominions, are the spirits of those who were
pre-eminent in justice.  In the seventh, that of Saturn, which is
directed by Thrones, are the spirits of the contemplative.  The
eighth, that of the Fixed Stars, which is directed by Cherubim,
has no special occupants, but in it the Triumph of Christ is
revealed to Dante.  The ninth Heaven, which is called the
Crystalline, or ^Primum Mobile~, and is directed by Seraphim, is
the source of the general motion of the Heavens from east to
west.  The tenth is the Empyrean Heaven, in which is the visible
presence of God; here there is neither motion, nor time, nor
place.  It is the permanent abode of the Blessed, who only reveal
themselves in the lower spheres in order to intimate to Dante
their various degrees of felicity, and the celestial influences
by which they were affected during their life on earth.  The
subject of the Paradiso is one which tasked Dante's poetic skill
to the utmost, not only on account of its sublimity and its
transcendental character, but because of the uniformity of
treatment which it involved.  In contrast with the exciting
incidents of the Inferno, and the frequent change of scene in the
Purgatorio, the accompaniments -- the atmosphere, we might almost
say -- of this part of the poem are light, music and rhythmic 
movement.  The regular recurrence of these, and the absence of 
variety which results from it, required to be counterbalanced by
the introduction of other elements, such as imagination and art 
can furnish; and of devices of this nature the Poet has largely 
availed himself.  In illustration of this it may be remarked, 
that the number of the similes which are found in the Paradiso is
very large, so that they exceed by one-third those that occur in
either of the other two parts of the poem. 

	|1-36.  These lines are to be regarded as a Prologue or
Introduction, as Dante tells us in his letter to Can Grande, 
^Epist.~ x. {para.} 17. ll. 287-92. 

	|2.  e risplende~: `yet it shines'; though the glory of 
God pervades the universe, yet it is manifested in different 
degrees in different parts of that universe.  Dante himself 
explains this so in Letter to Can Grande, {para.} 20. ll. 
349-52. 

	|4-6.  Nel ciel che pi@u~, &c.: this is the highest 
Heaven, or Empyrean, where was the immediate presence of God. 
|Fu' io~: this is almost equivalent to `I have been.'  Dante is 
apologizing here for the indequacy of his account of Paradise, 
and in doing so he says that n one part of his journey through 
that realm he was in the abode of God's presence, which no mortal
can describe.  |N@e sa~, |n@e pu@o~: he has not the ^knowledge~,
because he does not recollect them; he has not the ^power~, 
because human language cannot express them: cp. Letter to Can 
Grande, {para.} 29. ll. 573-5.  |chii~, &c.: one who, like Dante,
or like St. Paul (cp. 2 Cor. xii. 2-4), had been in Heaven 
and had returned to earth. 

	|7-9.  Perch@e~, &c.: `because our intellect, in drawing 
near to the object of its desire (God), reaches such depths, that
the memory cannot follow it,' so as to bring away an account of 
what it saw; Letter to Can Grande, {para.} 28. l. 530, `memoria
sequi non potest.' 

	|10-11.~  Veramente: `nevertheless'; cp. Purg. ii. 98; vi.
43.  |far tesoro~: `store up,' `treasure up.' 

	|13-15.  Apollo~: in the two other ^Cantiche~ Dante had 
invoked the Muses (Inf. ii. 7; Purg. i. 8); here he invokes 
Apollo himself.  |si fatto vaso, &c.~: `a fit receptacle of thy 
power, such as thou dost require for the gift of thy loved bay,'
i.e. as a condition of bestowing on the Poet the crown of bay- 
leaves.  |amato~ refers to Apollo's love for Daphne; cp. 
^diletto~, l. 25.  According to the story which is given in Ov. 
^Met.~ i. 543-52, Daphne, who was a daughter of the river 
Peneius, was metamorphosed on its banks into the bay-tree, in 
order to save her from Apollo who was pursuing her.  In 
consequence of this the bay is called by Dante ^fronda Peneia~, 
l. 32. 

	|16-18.  Infino~, &c.: the general meaning of the passage 
seems to be: -- `Hitherto I have been content with the ordinary 
measure of poetic inspiration; for the more exalted subject which
remains I require a twofold measure.'  It is well to notice the 
origin of she idea concerning the summits of Parnassus, from 
which Dante's metaphorical language is drawn.  That mountain 
rises to a single conspicuous summit; and when the Greek poets 
speak of its two summits (Soph. ^Ant.~ 1126; Eurip. ^Bacch.~ 
307; cp. ^Ion.~ 86-8) they mean, not the real summit of the 
mountain, but the two peaks that rise above Delphi, which are 
several thousand feet lower.  These expressions were 
misunderstood by the Roman poets, who regularly describe 
Parnassus as rising to two summits; e.g. Ov. ^Met.~ i. 316, 
`Mons ibi verticibus petit arduus astra duobus, Nomine 
Parnassus'; Lucan, v. 72, `Parnassus gemino petit aethera 
|colle.'~ Dante followed them, and naturally fell into the same 
mistake.  Then, as Parnassus is the representative of poetic 
inspiration, he quaintly regards the two summits as a double 
portion of that inspiration.  There is no sufficient ground for 
saying, as some commentators do, that one peak was sacred to 
Apollo, the other to Bacchus and the Muses; and that when the two
peaks are named it is implied that Dante, who hitherto has 
invoked the Muses, now invokes Apollo also.  Great confusion 
existed in the minds of post-classical writers about these two 
(supposed) peaks of Parnassus, and by some -- e.g. Servius (on 
^Aen.~ vii. 641 and x. 163) and Isidore (^Orig.~ xiv. 8) -- 
they were identified with Helicon and Cithaeron.  But the two 
divinities to whom they were regarded as being sacred were Apollo
and Bacchus; and no writer, so far as we know, with whom Dante 
was acquainted, regarded one peak as dedicated to Apollo and the
other to the Muses.  In fact, the only passage which may be taken
to imply this is found in the ^Scholia in Bucolica et Georgica~ 
attributed to Probus the Grammarian (^Georg.~ iii. 43), and 
there is no reason to suppose that Dante knew that work. 

	|19-21.  spira tue~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Grant me 
that inspiration which thou didst thyself feel, when thou didst 
vanquish and flay Marsyas.'  Marsyas challenged Apollo to a 
contest of skill in music, and the god, after he had vanquished 
him, flayed him alive.  |spira~ refers to the inspiration of 
Apollo's music, not to his breathing into the flute, for the 
instrument which he employed in this contest was the lyre. 
|traesti~, &c.: the act of flaying is somewhat extravagantly 
described as drawing the victim forth from the scabbard which 
encased his limbs.  As Dante has borrowed the story from Ov. 
^Met.~ vi. 382 foll., this expression was probably in part 
suggested by Marsyas' exclamation which occurs in that passage, 
`Quid me mihi detrahis?' l. 385. 

	|22-24.  O divina~, &c.: `O divine inspiration (of Apollo),
if thou dost vouchsafe me thyself in such measure, that I may
express in words that shadowy image of the blessed realm which is
stamped on my brain.' 

	|25-27.  diletto legno~: the bay-tree, as in l. 15.  |Che~:
`of which'; cp. Purg. xxi. 53, `dei tre gradi ch' io parlai.' 
Instances of the omission of the prep. with the relative, as
here, are most commonly found when the same prep. occurs with the
antecedent.  |la materia e tu~: `the subject and thy aid.'
|farai~: the verb here agrees with the latter of the two
subjects; cp. Inf. viii. 28. 

	|29.  Per trionfar~, &c.: `for (in honour of) the triumph
either of an emperor or a poet.'  This is an imitation of 
Statius, ^Achill~ i. 15, `geminae florent vatumque ducumque 
Certatim laurus.' 

	|31-33.  Che partorir~, &c.: `that the foliage of the 
Peneius (the bay-tree) must gladden the heart of the gladsome god
of Delphi, when it inspires any one with longing for it.'  The 
epithet |lieta~ here expresses the character of Apollo as the god
of brightness and joy. 

	|34-36.  Poca~, &c.: `a tiny spark is followed by a burst 
of flame',; similarly, Dante implies, greater poets may be 
inspired by his example.  |Si pregher@a~, &c.: `prayer will be 
made, to evoke a favourable reply from Delphi.'  |Cirra~: the
name of Cirrha, the port of Delphi, is here used for the oracle
itself as it is by Statius, ^Theb.~ iii. 106, 455, 474. 

	|37-45.~  The Prologue having been concluded with the 
preceding line, the Paradiso proper here commences.  Dante begins
by stating the time of year, and the time of day, at which his 
ascent from the Terrestrial Paradise to Heaven took place.  The 
time of year was the Vernal Equinox, which is regarded as the 
most propitious season because it ushers in the spring.  The time
of day was noon (see note on ll. 43-5), which is the culminating
point of the twenty-four hours.  Thus the moment of his ascent 
was a peculiarly auspicious one. 

	|37-38.  Surge~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `The sun rises at
different points of the horizon' according to the time of year. 
|foci~: lit. `entrances,' as we speak of the `gates' of day. 

	|38-42.  ma da quella~, &c.: `but when he comes forth 
from that point, which joins four circles with three crosses, his
course is most propitious, and he is in combination with the most
beneficent constellation, and modifies and moulds the mass of the
earth most after his own fashion.'  |che quattro cerchi~, &c.:
the point on the horizon (|foce~) here intended is that at which
the sun rises at the vernal equinox.  At that time the ecliptic,
the equator, and the equinoctial colure intersect one another and
the horizon, and the intersections of the three former of these 
circles with the horizon form three crosses.  |stella~: the 
constellation of Aries, in which the sun is at the beginning of 
spring, when he brings bright weather in his train (|miglior 
corso~).  |suggella~: the formative influence of the sun on the 
surface of the earth in bringing on vegetation and crops, drying
marshes, forming streams, &c., is compared to the impress of a 
seal on wax. 

	|43-45.  Fatto avea~, &c.: the difficulty of this passage 
arises from the Poet having introduced into one sentence two 
times of day, viz. sunrise -- which is mentioned in connexion 
with the preceding six lines in order to determine the season of
the year -- and midday, which is the time intended in the 
narrative.  This difficulty disappears, if we give due weight to
the tenses of the verbs, pluperfect and imperfect respectively. 
Paraphrase thus: -- `It was near this point on the horizon that 
the sun had risen, making morning there (in the southern 
hemisphere, where the Mountain of Purgatory was), and 
consequently evening here (in our hemisphere); and the whole of 
the southern hemisphere ^was now~ (at midday) in light, and the 
whole of the opposite hemisphere in darkness.'  |Tal foce 
quasi~: lit. `this point of sunrise or nearly this point'; the 
qualifying adverb |quasi~ is added to |tal foce~, because it was
now April 13, and the vernal equinox was on March 21.  |tutto~, 
&c.: from what is here said, viz. that the whole of the southern
hemisphere was in light, it follows that it was midday at the
Mountain of Purgatory, which was its central point, as Jerusalem
was that of the northern hemisphere.  Consequently Dante's ascent
from the summit of the Terrestrial Paradise must have taken place
at that hour, and not at sunrise, as many interpreters maintain. 
To this latter view it is a further objection, that in that case
he would without any reason have passed 18 hours on that summit,
which he would have reached at noon on the previous day (Purg.
xxxiii. 104).

	|46.  sinistro~: Dante's course from his entrance into 
the Terrestrial Paradise until he reached its highest point (and
consequently that of Beatrice after she joined him) was from W. 
to E.; cp. Purg. xxviii. 7-12; xxix. 12.  Consequently in order 
to face the sun -- which at midday was in the N. since they were
in the southern hemisphere -- she had to turn to the left. 

	|49-51.  si come~, &c.: Dante compares his action in 
imitating Beatrice by looking full at the orb of the sun, to the
reflexion of a ray of sunlight from a bright surface.  |Pur
come~, &c.: the ray of light naturally returning to the heaven
from which it came is further compared to a pilgrim longing to
return when he has reached the term of his journey.  For another
instance of a simile within a simile cp. Par. iii. 10-5. 

	|52-53.  Cosi~, &c.: `so from her action (of looking at the
sun), which passed through the medium of my eyes into my
imagination, did my action arise'; cp. ll. 46, 47, where Dante is
represented as looking at Beatrice, while she looks at the sun. 

	|56.  loco~: the Terrestrial Paradise; cp. Purg. xxviii. 
92, 93. 

	|58-60.  n@e si poco~, &c.: `yet not for so short a space 
of time that I failed to see the orb of the sun sparkle all 
round.' |bogliente~: `molten.' 

	|61-63.  parve~, &c.: `the light of day appeared to be 
increased twofold, as if God, who has the power to do so, had 
adorned the heaven with another sun.'  The increase of light was
due to Dante's ascent towards heaven, of which at the time he was
unconscious. 

	|64-66.  rote~: the spheres of Heaven.  |di lass@u remote~:
`withdrawing them from above,' i.e. from the sun. 

	|67-69.  Nel suo~, &c.: `by looking at her I became 
inwardly such as Glaucus became by tasting of the herb, which 
made him a peer of the marine divinities.'  The story of Glaucus
-- a fisherman, who in consequence of eating a divine herb which
grew near the seashore was changed into a sea-god -- is given by
Ov. ^Met.~ xiii. 904 foll.  Glaucus there says of himself (ll. 
949-51), `Di maris exceptum socio dignantur honore, Utque mihi 
quaecumque feram mortalia demant Oceanum Tethymque rogant'; and 
again (ll. 958, 959), `alium me corpore toto Ac fueram nuper, 
nec eundem mente recepi.' Similarly, the effect on Dante of 
contemplating the eyes of Beatrice, who represents the Divine 
Wisdom, was to raise him above the level of his humanity. 

	|70-72.  Trasumanar~, &c.: `to express in words the change 
from an earthly to a heavenly nature is impossible; wherefore (as
ar aid to realizing it) let the example (of Glaucus) suffice to 
him, for whom the grace of God has the experience of it in store
(in the future life).' 

	|73-75.  S' io era~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `whether I 
was at this time in the spirit only, or in the body also, God 
only knows.'  This is an adaptation of St. Paul's words
concerning his having been caught up to Heaven -- `whether in the
body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God
knoweth' (2 Cor. xii. 2).  Lit. `whether I was only that part of
me which thou didst last create (i.e. the spirit), thou knowest.'
According to the Creationist view of the origin of the rational 
soul which Dante maintained (see note on Purg. xxv. 67-75), when
the ^fetus~ was formed in the womb, the rational soul was infused
by God himself, and consequently came last in the order of 
creation.  |novellamente~: this word properly signifies
`recently'; here it means `recently as compared with my body,' 
and so `last in order of creation.'  |Amor~, &c.: God is meant. 
The expression is from Bo,ethius, ^De Cons.~ ii. Metr. 8, `caelo
imperitans Amor.' 

	|76-77.  la rota~, &c.: `the motion of the spheres, which
thou dost cause to be eternal through their longing for thee,'
lit. `being longed for by them.'  The ninth sphere, or ^Primum
Mobile~, which originated the rotatcry movement of the other
spheres, was itself set in motion by its longing to approach to
the presence of God; hence God is `colui che tutto move,'
^supra~, l. 1.  This idea was derived in the first instance from
Aristotle, who says (^Metaph.~ xi. 7. 2) that the divinity, by
being the object of desire, attracts, and thus sets in motion,
the universe.'  Cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 19-30. 

	|78.  l' armonia~: this is the `ninefold harmony' of the 
`crystal spheres' in Milton's ^Ode on the Nativity~; Dante refers
to it also in Purg. xxx. 93.  It was supposed to be produced by 
the spheres of Heaven in their revolution.  The idea was of 
Pythagorean origin, and Dante was acquainted with it through 
Cicero, ^Somnium Scipionis~, {para.} 5.  |che temperi e 
discerni~: `which thou dost modulate and distinguish.'  In order
for harmony to be produced, there must be a number of different 
sounds, and these must be made to accord with one another.  The 
former of these conditions is implied in |discerni~, `dost 
distinguish,' because God assigns different sounds to the various
spheres; the latter is implied in |temperi~, `dost modulate,' 
because God regulates or harmonizes these sounds.  Cp. ^Som. 
Scip.~, `Hic [dulcis sonus] est, qui intervallis coniunctus 
imparibus, sed tamen pro-rata parte ratione ^distinctis~, impulsu
et motu ipsorum orbium conficitur, et, acuta cum gravibus 
^temperans~, varios aequabiliter concentus efficit.' 

	|79.  Parvemi~, &c.: Dante has now been transported, though
unconscious of the change, into the region of fire, which
intervenes between our atmosphere and the sphere of the moon; the
vast extent of this, as it appears to him, he can only compare to
a broad lake. 

	|83-84.  Di lor cagion~, &c.: `kindled in me a desire to 
learn their cause, more keen than I had ever felt before.' 

	|85-87.  vedea me~, &c.: `read my thoughts, even as I did 
myself.'  A similar power of insight has been frequently 
attributed to Virgil in the earlier portions of the poem, e. g. 
Inf. xxiii. 25-30.  |Pria ch' io~, &c.: `before I opened my lips
to ask the question.' 

	|88-90.  Tu stesso~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Thou art 
thyself in fault, through obscuring thy mind by the false notion
that thou art still on earth.'  |se l' avessi scosso~: `if thou 
hadst shaken thyself clear (disabused thyself) of that notion.' 

	|92-93.  Ma folgore~, &c.: Beatrice here informs Dante 
of the transit which he has made, and of its rapidity.  |proprio
sito~: lightning descends from the sphere of fire, which is its 
natural home; Dante is returning to Heaven, the home from which,
according to the views of Creationism, his soul originally 
proceeded. 

	|95.  sorrise~: `expressed with smiles.' 

	|97-99.  Gi@a~, &c.: `a moment ago I was satisfied, and 
had truce from great wonderment; but now I am marvelling how it 
comes to pass that I rise above these light substances.'  The 
`light substances' are air and fire, and when Dante rises above 
them he violates the law of gravitation.  In what follows 
Beatrice proceeds to solve this fresh difficulty in Dante's mind
by explaining to him the order of the universe.  |requievi~: Lat.
form. 

	|100. pio~: `compassionate.' 

	|103-141.~  Beatrice's explanation may be thus summarized. 
The order of the universe is appointed by God, so that every part
of it has its proper function, and is impelled towards the 
discharge of this function by an instinct implanted in it (ll. 
103-14).  This principle applies alike to inanimate nature, to 
the brute creation, and to rational beings (ll. 115-20).  The 
instinct of the last-named class impels them upward towards the 
presence of God, but this influence may be interfered with by 
man's possession of free will, which allows of his being drawn in
another direction by lower attractions (ll. 121-35).  But when, 
as in Dante's case, the counterinfluence of sin has been removed,
the higher instinct reasserts itself, and impels him upward 
towards Heaven (ll. 136-41). 

	|104-105.  questo @e forma~, &c.: `this order is the 
formative principle, which causes the universe to resemble God';
for |forma~ in this sense cp. Par. xxxiii. 91. 

	|106-108.  Qui veggion~, &c.: `in this (the orderly working
of the universe) the angels and other higher intelligences trace
the footstep (find the evidence) of God's excellence, which is 
the end, or final object, to correspond to which the system just
mentioned is ordained.' 

	|109-111.  Nell' ordine~, &c.: `in the order of which I am 
speaking all natures gravitate (towards the divine essence).' 
|per diverse sorti~: `variously allotted,' i.e. assigned to 
different positions, higher and lower, and exercising different 
functions, in the scheme of the universe.  |Pi@u~, &c.: `some 
nearer to, some more remote from, him from whom they are 
derived.' 

	|112-114.  Onde~, &c.: `hence it is that they shape their 
course over the ocean of existence to various havens (i.e. their
rightful places), each of them impelled by the instinct given it
to bear it thither.' 

	|115-117.  Questi ne porta~, &c.: `this instinct it is 
which causes the element of fire to rise towards the moon.'  The
region of fire extended upwards to the limits of the sphere of 
the moon.  |cor mortali~: i.e. all living creatures; in ll. 
118-20 Beatrice goes on to say that men as well as brutes are 
included.  |in s@e stringe~, &c.: `this instinct it is, which 
binds together and unifies the earth.'  The instinct in this case
is the force of gravitation towards the centre, which causes the
earth to perform its appointed function in the scheme of the 
universe. 

	|119.  quest' arco saetta~: `does this bow shoot forth,' 
i.e. `does this motive power impel and direct.' 

	|121-123.  cotanto assetta~: `regulates this mighty frame.'
From Inf. xvii. 22, 91 it appears that the first meaning of 
^assettare~ is `to seat,' `settle'; and so it is probably derived
from Lat. ^sedere.~  |del suo lume~, &c.: `causes by his light 
that Heaven to be ever tranquil, within which revolves that which
moves most rapidly.'  |il ciel~, &c.: the Empyrean, which does
not move.  |quel~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, which is immediately
within the Empyrean.  As this is the highest (outermost) of all 
the spheres which move, it has the most extensive, and therefore
the most rapid, revolution. 

	|124-126.  li~: to the Empyrean.  |a sito decreto~: `to an 
appointed resting-place.'  |quella corda~, &c.: `the string of 
that bow (the instinct), which directs to a joyous mark the 
arrows which it shoots.' 

	|127-129.  Ver' @e~, &c.: the failure of human nature to 
attain to that towards which its higher instinct impels it, is 
here compared to the failure of human art to realize the 
conception which it desires to represent, owing to the 
imperfection of the material which it has to employ.  |forma~, 
&c.: `the form produced does not correspond to what the artist 
intends to represent.'  |@e sorda~: ` is dull in responding to 
what he demands of it.' 

	|130-132.  questo corso~: its upward course.  |ha potere~, 
&c.: `has the power (owing to free will), after it has received
this (upward) impulse (|cosi pinta~), to swerve in another
direction.' 

	|133.  E si come~, &c.: this deflection of the soul from 
its upward course is compared to lightning, which instead of 
rising, which it is the nature of fire to do (cp. Purg. xviii. 
28-30), falls downward. 

	|134-135.  se l' impeto~, &c.: `if its original
(instinctive) impulse, having been diverted from its course by 
false pleasure, brings it to the ground.'  The instinct to attain
the highest good continues to be the moving force, but it is 
misdirected by a wrong conception of what the highest good is. 
In l. 135 there is another reading ^A terra @e torto~, but it 
has hardly any MS. authority; see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 437. 

	|136-138.  Non dei~, &c.: Beatrice here finally solves 
Dante's difficulty. `There is nothing more surprising in your 
rising upward than in a stream flowing downward'; it is the 
natural tendency in both cases.  |se non come~: `any more than';
cp. Par. x. 90; xxxii. 54. 

	|139-141.  privo~, &c.: the impediment which would have 
prevented Dante from rising was the power of sin, and this had 
been annulled by the water of Lethe.  |assiso~: this word implies
permanent abode.  |come a terra~, &c.: `just as repose on earth 
would be strange in a living flame.'  `On earth' is used here in
contrast to `in its own sphere, that of fire,' where it would 
naturally be at rest.
