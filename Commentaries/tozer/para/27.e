	|5-6.  per che~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `so that my mind
was affected by ecstasy through what I saw as well as through
what I heard.' 

	|10-11.  le quattro face~: St. Peter, St. James, St. John,
and Adam; of these `the one who came first' is St. Peter. 

	|13-15.  E tal~, &c.: St. Peter's indignation, which
expresses itself in the speech that follows, is manifested by the
robe of light which envelops him assuming a red hue; this change
is illustrated by the supposition that the white planet Jupiter 
should assume the plumage, so to speak, of the red planet Mars. 
The plumage in this comparison corresponds to the robe of light. 

	|16-17.  che quivi~, &c.: `which in Heaven assigns to each
his fitting time and part.'  |vice~ is the occasion when this 
or that person is to act, |offizio~ the function which he is to 
perform.  For the general principle which is here expressed cp. 
Par. xxi. 67-72. 

	|22-24.  Quegli~, &c.: Boniface VIII, who owing to his
crimes unrighteously occupied the see of St. Peter, which 
consequently in the sight of Christ was vacant.  It seems better
to attribute this meaning to |usurpa~ and |vaca~, than to regard
them as implying that the see was ^ipso facto~ vacant because 
Celestine V, the predecessor of Boniface, was still alive. 
|Nella presenza~, &c.: in the sight of Christ, the head of the 
Church in Heaven, Boniface was an apostate, though on earth he 
was to be recognized as Pope.  It is from the latter point of 
view that the ignominious treatment of him by the agents of 
Philip the Fair at Anagni is regarded by Dante as sacrilegious; 
Purg. xx. 85-7. 

	|25-27.  cimitero mio~: Rome, which was the reputed burial-
place of St. Peter.  |cloaca~: it is so called on account of its
defilement by murder and corruption.  |il perverso~: Lucifer. 
|laggi@u si placa~: `rejoices in Hell.' 

	|28-29.  quel color~, &c.: `that (red) hue, which tints the
clouds at morn and eve from the sun being in the opposite
quarter.' 

	|32-33.  per l' altrui fallanza~: `for shame at another's
misdoing.'  |fane~: for ^ne fa.~ 

	|35.  eclissi~: `eclipse,' `darkness,' like that which 
covered the earth at the time of the Crucifixion. 

	|41.  Lin~: Linus is regarded as St. Peter's successor as 
Bishop of Rome, and Cletus as having followed Linus. 

	|43-45.  esto viver lieto~: the joys of Heaven.  |Sisto~, 
&c.: of the four Bishops of Rome here mentioned the first two 
lived in Cent. ii. the last two in Cent. iii.  |fleto~: 
`suffering,' lit. `weeping'; the reference is to the persecution 
which culminated in their deaths. 

	|46-48.  ch' a destra mano~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `that 
the Guelf party should be favoured by the Popes, and the 
Ghibellines persecuted.' 

	|50-51.  segnacolo~, &c.: the keys of St. Peter were the 
emblem on the Papal banner.  |Che contra~, &c.: `to be used in 
combat against Christians,' and not in a Crusade against the 
enemies of the Cross; cp. Inf. xxvii. 85-90. 

	|52-54.  figura~, &c.: the figure of St. Peter on the seal 
which was attached to bulls and other Papal documents.  The sale
of indulgences is here referred to.  |disfavillo~: `flash with 
fire.' 

	|57.  difesa di Dio~: `weapons (lit. defence) of God's 
armoury.' 

	|58-59.  Caorsini e Guaschi~: John XXII, a native of Cahors
(Pope 1316-1334), and Clement V (1305-1314), a native of Gascony
(^il Guasco~ of Par. xvii. 82), together with their adherents. 
The dates here given show that these remarks of St. Peter must be
regarded as prophetic from the point of view of 1300 A.D.  The
mention of John XXII as Pope here and in Par. xviii. 130 proves
that this part of the poem was written after 1316, the date of
his election.  |principio~: i.e. Church of the early ages. 

	|61-63.  che con Scipio~, &c.: `which by the hands of Scipio
maintained for Rome the empire of the world.'  Scipio Africanus
the younger, the conqueror of Hannibal, is meant; cp. ^Conv.~ iv.
5. ll. 164-71.  |Soccorr@a tosto~: Dante here, as elsewhere, is
anticipating the coming of a hoped-for regenerator of the world. 

	|64.  per lo mortal pondo~: `because you still bear the 
burden of the flesh.'

	|67-69.  Si come~, &c.: the spirits which formed the Triumph
of Christ now ascend to the Empyrean.  Their appearance as they
float upwards, is compared to that of flakes of snow falling in a
snowstorm.  Similarly in the ^Vita Nuova~ {part} 23. l. 185, the
ascent of a glory of Angels is described as `pioggia di manna.'
Translate: -- `As with congealed vapours our atmosphere falls in
flakes (|fiocca In giuso~).'  |quando~, &c.: in mid-winter (from
the middle of December to the middle of january) when the sun is
in Capricorn. 

	|71.  floccar~, &c.: `flaked with triumphant vapours' i.e. 
spirits. 

	|74-75.  in fin che~, &c.: `until the vastness of the 
intervening space prevented my eyes from penetrating beyond.' 

	|76-78.  assolto~: `freed,' lit. `absolved,' `excused.' 
|come~, &c.: `how far thou hast gone round.'  The object of 
Beatrice here, and of Dante's remarks which follow, seems to be 
to draw attention to the rapidity of their movement. 

	|79-81.  Dall' ora~, &c.: `reckoning from the time when I 
had looked before (cp. Par. xxii. 134, 151-3), I saw that I had 
passed along the whole of the arc which the first clime forms 
from its middle point to its end.'  This means that Dante had 
moved through 90+o~ of longitude, from the meridian of Jerusalem 
-- which place was the central point of the habitable world of 
180+o~ in length reckoned from E. to W. -- to that of Gades,
which marked its western limit.  In order to understand the terms
in which Dante has expressed this, we must first examine the
meaning of the word |clima.~  The ^climata~ of the Greek
geographers were belts or spaces of the earth's surface which
intervened between two parallels of latitude; and by Hipparchus,
who first invented the term, these intervals were measured by
degrees of latitude; but Ptolemy, who subsequently adopted it,
determined them by the increase of the length of the longest day,
proceeding northwards from the equator to the parallel of Thule,
and dividing the intervening space into 21 ^climata.~ 
Alfraganus, who is Dante's authority in this matter, adapted the
scheme of Ptolemy to his own purposes, and reduced the number of
^climata~ to seven, commencing the computation, not from the
equator, but from Lat. 12+o~ 45' N., which was to him the limit
of the habitable globe to the south (Alfr. ^Element. Astronom.~ 
cap. x.).  The first of these ^climata~, the central parallel of
which passed through Mero,e, was the only one which lay wholly
within the tropics, and this is the reason why it is mentioned
here, because the position of Dante at this time was immediately
over the northern half of the torrid zone.  For Gemini, in which
he now was, is one of the signs of the zodiac; and as the sun
never passes to the northward of the tropic of Cancer, the signs
of the zodiac, through which his course lies, must fall within
the same limit.  Hence Dante, in describing himself as passing,
while he was in Gemini, from the meridian of Jerusalem to that of
Gades, says that he moved along the arc formed by the |primo
clima.~  The interval between those two points is represented as
reaching from the middle to the end of the first ^clima~, because
to Alfraganus the ^climata~ were divisions not of the entire
globe, but of the habitable globe (thus he says `Loca quadrantis
^habitabilis~ dividuntur in septem climata'), and he regarded
their extension from E. to W. as corresponding to twelve hours in
time (`longitudo omnium climatum ab oriente in occasum spatio 12
horarum a revolutione caelesti conficitur'), which represent
180+o~ in space.  Consequently the half of this extension (|dal
mezzo al fine~) would be six hours in time, or 90+o~ in space,
thus corresponding to the difference between Jerusalem and Gades.
|Fine~ is appropriately used of the western extremity of the
^clima~, because the movement of the sun, and that of Dante 
himself in the zodiac, which are here regarded, are from E. to W.
It is hardly necessary to add that, when it is said that Dante
was on the meridian of Jerusalem or of Gades, it does not follow
that he was over those places, but only that he was in the same
longitude with them. 

	|82-84.  varco~: `passage,' `track,' as in Inf. xix. 132. 
The |varco Folle d' Ulisse~ is the same as the ^folle volo~ of 
Inf. xxvi. 125, i.e. the voyage of Ulysses through the Atlantic;
here, in other words, it means the Atlantic Ocean which Ulysses
navigated.  |di qua~, &c.: `on this side I almost saw the shore,
on which Europa became a sweet burden,' i.e. the coast of
Phoenicia, from which Jupiter in the form of a bull carried off
Europa; see Ov. ^Met.~ ii. 833 foll.  The Phoenician coast is
here used as a geographical equivalent of Jerusalem.  The reason
why |presso~ (`almost') is added is that, whereas the earth's
hemisphere, as seen by Dante from the meridian of Gades in the
Heaven of the Fixed Stars, would reach as far east as Jerusalem
-- because, as we have seen, that place according to Dante's
mathematical geography was 90+o~, or half the earth's hemisphere,
distant from Gades -- yet the eastern part of that area would be
in shadow and invisible, because the sun, which was in Aries, was
some distance to the west of Gemini.  This is explained in ll.
85-7.  (A difficulty, however, remains in the use of the word
|presso~, because, as Dante says in l. 87, the sun was a sign of
the zodiac and more in advance of Gemini, and consequently the
greater part of the eastern half of the Mediterranean, and not
only -- as `I almost saw' would seem to imply -- that in the
neighbourhood of Phoenicia. would be invisible.) 

	|85-87.  E pi@u~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `I should have 
seen more of the habitable world but this was hidden from me, 
because the sun was passing on towards the west, and consequently
the eastern part was in shadow.'  This is a comment on ^presso~
in l. 83, explaining that the view would have extended, not
nearly, but quite, as far as the Phoenician coast (in other
words, to Jerusalem), had it not been that the sun was some 
distance to the west of Gemini.  Observe that |pi@u~ cannot imply
any ground to the eastward of Jerusalem, for that would in any 
case be invisible, since Jerusalem was the limit of the view in 
that direction, as has been explained in the preceding note. 
|fora~: for ^sarebbe stato~; for other instances of the use of 
the present for the past conditional cp. Par. xv. 127; xxxiii. 
77.  |aiuola~: `plot of earth'; cp. Par. xxii. 151.  |un segno~,
&c.: `separated from me by a sign of the zodiac and more.'  As
Dante was in Gemini, and the sun was in Aries, the whole of
Taurus and parts of those two constellations were between them. 

	|88-89.  donnea~: `dallies'; cp. Par. xxiv. 118.  |ridure~:
this is an earlier form of ^riducere~ than ^ridurre~; cp. ^fare~
from ^facere~, ^dire~ from ^dicere.~ 

	|91-93.  fe' pasture~, &c.: `prepared a banquet of delight
to captivate the eyes, and so to (lit. so as to) possess the
mind': for ^pasture~ cp. Par. xxi. 19.  |In carne~, &c.: `whether
in the form of human flesh (which is the work of ^nature~), or in
pictures of it (which are the work of ^art~).' 

	|97-99.  la virt@u~, &c.: `the power which her look bestowed
upon me.'  |nido di Leda~: the constellation of Gemini is called
`the nest of Leda,' because Leda, the mother of the Twins, Castor
and Pollux, was visited by Jupiter, their father, in the form of
a swan, and she brought forth an egg.  |ciel velocissimo~: the
Crystalline Heaven, or ^Primum Mobile~, which being the outermost
of the spheres was also the swiftest in its revolution.  To this
ninth sphere Dante and Beatrice now rise. 

	|100-102.  vivissime~: `exceeding full of life,' i.e. of
motion.  |uniformi~: i.e. not distinguished by constellations,
like the eighth sphere.  Hence there was nothing in it like the
sign of Gemini to determine Dante's position. 

	|106-120.~  Beatrice here describes the character of the
^Primum Mobile~, as being the source of motion -- and through 
motion of the computation of time -- to the rest of the universe,
and deriving its motion immediately from God. 

	|106-108.  che quieta~, &c.: `which causes the central point
(i.e. the earth) to be at rest, and communicates motion to the
spheres around.'  |meta~: `starting-point.' 

	|109-111.  dove~: `place'; cp. Par. xxii. 147.  It is not 
intended here that the ^Primum Mobile~ is not a material circle,
for it is the ^Crystalline~ sphere: it is one of the ^cerchi 
corporai~ in Par. xxviii. 64 and is called ^maggior corpo~ in 
Par. xxx. 39.  What is meant is that that which is beyond it and
determines its position is nothing else than the Divine Mind. 
|L' amor~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~ is set in motion by its 
longing to approach to God, and the other spheres by their
longing to approach to it; see note on Par. i. 76.  |la virt@u~,
&c.: the influence which it (the ^Primum Mobile~) communiates to
the other spheres; see note on Par. ii. 112-4. 

	|112-114.  Luce~, &c.: `light and love form a sphere
encircling it (lit. `embrace it with a sphere'), even as this 
sphere (the ^Primum Mobile~) encircles the other spheres.'  By 
`light and love' the Empyrean is meant; cp. Par. xxviii. 53, 54.
|precinto~: `circuit,' `circle': this again is the Empyrean.
`Over that circle He alone who embraces it presides.'  Each of
the nine lower circles has its own presiding angelic
Intelligences, but the Intelligence which presides over the tenth
Heaven is God only.  For |intende~ in this sense cp. ^intendendo~
in Par. viii. 37. 

	|115-117.  Non @e~, &c.: `the motion of the ^Primum Mobile~
is not determined by any other,' i.e. by the motion of any other
sphere.  |Si come~, &c.: this is a specimen of exact or perfect 
measurement.  The half of ten, i.e. five, and its fifth part,
i.e. two, when multiplied together make ten. 

	|118-119.  E come~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, in which 
distinctions of time originate, but are not apparent, is compared
to a flower-pot, which contains the roots of a plant concealed 
within it: the other spheres, which derive their measurements of
time from this, are described as containing the leaves of the 
plant, which are the visible products of the root, because time 
is measured by the visible motion of the sun and the planets. 

	|121-122.  O cupidigia~, &c.: from the exposition of the 
mystery of the divine government of the universe Beatrice turns 
to denounce the degradation of men owing to their mean interests,
which blind them to the sublime verities.  |affonde~, &c.: `dost
so submerge mankind beneath thy waters.' 

	|126.  bozzacchioni~: `blasted fruit'; strictly the word 
means `plums (|susine~) which are damaged by continuous
rainfall.'  The `unceasing rain' here signifies the corrupting 
influences by which men are surrounded. 

	|127-129.  Fede~: the metrical ^hiatus~ after this word is 
altogether exceptional.  |coperte~: `covered with a beard.' 

	|130-132.  Tale~, &c.: `one, who already while still a
lisping child observes the fasts, when he can speak plainly (i.e.
has reached years of discretion) eats any kind of food in any 
season (lit. month)'; i.e. he observes neither fixed times nor 
prescribed forms of fasting. 

	|136-138.  Cosi~, &c.: `so grows dark, as soon as seen (i.e.

from the very first), the fair skin of the beauteous daughter of
him who brings morning and leaves evening (i.e. of the sun).' 
The `beauteous daughter of the sun' is human nature; and the idea
which is thus expressed was derived by Dante from Aristotle,
^Phys.~ ii. 2. 11, %alpha%nu%theta%rho%omega%pi%omicron\
%alpha%nu%theta%rho%omega%pi%omicron%nu\
%gamma%epsilon%nu%nu%alpha\ %kappa%alpha%iota\
%eta%gamma%iota%omicron%sigma\, his familiarity with which
passage is shown by his referring to it in ^De Mon.~ i. 9. 4-7,
`Humanum genus filius est caeli...generat enim homo hominem et
sol, iuxta secundum de Naturali auditu.'  The same idea is
introduced by Dante in Par. xxii. 116, where the sun is described
as `Quegli ch' @e padre d' ogni mortal vita.'  The meaning of the
present lines then is -- `Human nature degenerates from the
first.' 

	|140.  Pensa~, &c.: here, as elsewhere (cp. Purg. xvi. 103
foll.), Dante attributes the corruption of the world to neglect
on the part of the ruling powers, both spiritual and temporal. 

	|142-144.  gennaio~: the last three vowels are pronounced
for metrical purposes as one syllable; cp. ^beccaio~, Purg. xx.
52.  |si sverni~: `passes (in reckoning) out of winter into
spring.'  The reckoning of the Julian calendar involved a yearly
error in excess of somewhat less than a hundredth part of a day 
(|la centesma~), and this in Dante's time amounted to an error of
about nine days, so that January was advanced by so much towards
the end of winter and beginning of spring.  It was this which was
corrected by the Gregorian calendar two centuries and a half 
later.  The general meaning, then, of |prima che~, &c., is
`before a very long time has passed'; but it is intended to be
understood ironically as meaning `before long,' `soon,' somewhat
in the same way as when we say `not a hundred miles off' for
`near.'  |ch' @e laggi@u negletta~: `to the correction of which
no attention is paid on earth.'  |Ruggiran~, &c.: `the
indignation of Heaven will be so great.' 

	|145-148.  la fortuna~: `the good fortune' i.e. the coming 
of a regenerator of society such as had been foreshadowed in the
^Veltro~ of Inf. i. 101 and the DUX of Purg. xxxiii 43.  |Le
poppe~, &c.: `shall reverse the present iniquitous condition of 
the world.'  |la classe~: by `the fleet' mankind are meant. 
|vero frutto~: not ^bozzacchioni~ (l. 126).
