	|1-9.~  Before commencing his description of the first
objects which he saw in Paradise, Dante in these lines warns off
those of his readers who had paid no attention to philosophy and
theology; in ll. 10-5 he encourages those who had done so. 

	|1-2.  barca~: the voyager in the `little boat,' which 
follows in the wake of the larger vessel, is the uninitiated but
inquisitive reader, to whom the mysteries which Dante is about to
reveal would be unintelligible.  The metaphor in |barca~ is the 
same as in the `navicella del mio ingegno' of Purg. i. 2; cp.
Par. xxiii. 67-9: |seguiti~: take with |siete~, `have followed 
(thus far).' 

	|6.  Perdendo me~, &c.: divested of metaphor this means --
`if you fail to follow my guidance in philosophical and
theological questions, you may lose your way in those subjects.' 

	|8-9.  Minerva~, &c.: `the goddess of wisdom wafts me on 
my course, the god of song is my pilot, and new Muses (a new 
source of poetical inspiration) give me my bearings.'  |nove~: 
this epithet is introduced because of the unwonted character of 
the task (|l' acqua che giammai non si corse~).  The word is also
explained as meaning `nine,' but it seems unpoetical to give the
number of the Muses, even if the object of doing so be to express
their collective force.  |l' Orse~: the polar stars, by which 
mariners steer. 

	|10-12.  drizzaste il collo~: i.e. `have uplifted your 
minds.' |pan degli Angeli~: the heavenly manna, i.e. the 
knowledge of higher subjects, and especially of theology; cp. 
^Conv.~ i. 1. ll. 52, 53.  |non sen vien satollo~: `does not 
leave the board sated,' `ever craves for more.' 

	|15.  Dinanzi~, &c.: lit. `in front of the water which 
resumes its calm surface'; in other words, `following closely to
make sure that the track is not obliterated.' 

	|16-18.  Quei gloriosi~, &c.: the Argonauts.  |bifolco~: 
`ploughman,' Lat. ^bubulcus.~  One of the labours imposed on 
Jason by Aeetes, king of Colchis, was to plough the ground with 
firebreathing bulls.  Dante knew the story from Ov. ^Met.~ vii. 
104-21, but he remembered the passage imperfectly, for, as Mr. 
Butler has pointed out, Ovid represents the Colchians, and not 
the Argonauts, as wondering; l. 120, `Mirantur Colchi; Minyae 
clamoribus implent, Adiiciuntque animos.' 

	|19-21.  La concreata~, &c.: `the innate and unquenchable 
thirst for (i.e. the instinct which impels the soul towards) 
the Empyrean.'  This latter is called |il deiforme regno~,
because it exists only in the mind of God; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 4. 
ll. 37-9, `esso non @e in luogo, ma formato fu solo nella prima
Mente.'  |come il ciel~, &c.: `as swiftly as ye see the heaven
move.'  The heaven here is the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, the
movement of which we see from the earth; its velocity is the
greatest of all after the ^Primum Mobile~, to which it is the
nearest. 

	|23-24.  in tanto~, &c.: Dante here describes the rapidity
of his passage to the Heaven of the Moon.  |posa~, &c.: `reaches
its mark, flies through the air, and is discharged from the peg
of the crossbow.'  Observe the inverted form of the statement,
which is intended to imply that the stages of the process here
given were almost simultaneous.  |noce~: this `nut' was a peg or
button on the crossbow, to which the cord was attached before
shooting; it was so called from its shape.  It is erroneously
rendered by `notch.' 

	|27.  mia opra~: `what was passing in my mind.' 

	|30.  la prima stella~: the Moon, which according to the 
Ptolemaic astronomy was one of the planets. 

	|33.  adamante~: here used for `diamond.' 

	|37-45.~  The reflexions which follow are suggested by the
words ^permanendo unita.~  When Dante's body entered the orb of
the moon, it did not displace any of the matter of which that 
orb is composed; but since the laws of nature do not admit of two
bodies occupying the same space, this occurrence was supernatural
or miraculous; hence Dante regards it as a fitting introduction 
to the cognate, though higher, miracle of the co-existence of two
natures, perfect God and perfect Man, in the Person of our Lord. 

	|37-40.  S' io era corpo~, &c.: `if I was a material body,
and here on earth it is impossible to conceive how one corporeal
substance could admit the presence of another such -- and this
must be the case when one body passes (lit. creeps) within
another body -- we ought to be more than ever fired by the
desire,' &c.  The doubt on Dante's part whether he was in the 
body or out of the body, which is expressed by |S' io era corpo~,
has already occurred in Par. i. 73.  |qui~: `here on earth'; this
is contrasted with ^L@i~ in l. 43, which means `in Heaven.' 
|dimension~: a Scholastic term for `corporeal substance.' 

	|42.  s' unio~: the singular verb with two subjects
expresses the perfect union of the two Natures in one Person in 
Christ.  Cp. Par. xxxiii. 116, `Parvemi tre giri,' where the 
Trinity in Unity is spoken of. 

	|43-45.  Li si vedr@a~, &c.: `there (in Heaven, where Christ
is present in His two Natures) that verity which we hold by faith
will be seen, not by means of a process of reasoning, but will be
selfevident, like the primary truths which man believes.' |per
s@e~, &c.: it will be known by intuition, like such primary
truths as the sense of personality, of right and wrong, &c.,
which come to us without any conscious process of reasoning.  Our
knowledge will then be immediate, not mediate. 

	|49~ foll.  Dante now proceeds to inquire concerning the
nature of the spots on the Moon's surface, a question which was
much discussed during the middle ages. 

	|51.  Cain~: cp. Inf. xx. 126, `Caino e le spine,' and note
there.  |altrui~: `men,' `persons'; cp. Purg. xxviii. 128. 

	|52-57.  S' egli erra~, &c.: `you have good reason now not 
to be surprised if men's views are at fault in matters which the
senses are unable to explain, because you see that reason, even 
where it has the guidance of the senses, can fly but feebly.'  In
other words -- `If men are in error about a thing which they can
see with their eyes, like the spots on the moon, how much more 
must this happen in spiritual matters, where the senses cannot 
help them.'  |poi~ in l. 56 is ^forpoich@e.~ 

	|59-60.  quass@u diverso~: i.e. light and dark on the face
of the moon.  |i corpi rari e densi~: `the rarity and density of
the materials which compose it.'  This explanation was originally
given by Averro,es ^De Substantia Orbis~, Ch. ii., and was
adopted by Dante in ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 69-76; he now proceeds to
retract it by the mouth of Beatrice.

	|61~ foll.  The remainder of the Canto is taken up with (1)
the refutation of Dante's view (ll. 61-105), and (2) the
statement of the true view (ll. 106-48).  The refutation takes
the form of two arguments -- one proceeding on abstract
principles, the other derived from observation -- viz. (a) that
the explanation of the markings on the moon's face by variations
of rarity and density is irreconcilable with what we know of
God's government of the universe (ll. 64-72); (b) that, if the
darkness of certain portions of the moon's orb is due to the
rarity of its substance, and consequently inferior power in
reflecting the sun's rays, in those parts, this must imply either
(%alpha\) that the rarity extends right through the orb, or
(%beta\) that the denser stratum lies further back in these parts
of the orb, and consequently the sun's light is less brightly
reflected (ll. 73-8).  But both these alternatives are shown by
observation to be inadmissible (ll. 79-105). 

	|64-72.~  These lines contain Beatrice's first argument 
in answer to Dante's explanation of the spots on the moon.  In 
order to understand it we must remember that in mediaeval 
theology the fixed stars were regarded as the primary medium 
through which the celestial influences (|virt@u~) were dispensed 
in various forms to the planetary spheres and the earth; and 
these influences were regarded as the constituent principles 
(|principii formali~), which determined the nature both of the 
different fixed stars and of the planets.  This system is 
explained below in ll. 112 foll.  In the present passage Beatrice
argues from the analogy of the fixed stars to the case of the 
moon, assuming that what applies to the one will apply to the 
other.  The fixed stars, she says, are seen to differ from one 
another in colour and in brightness (ll. 64-6).  If in their case
the difference were solely due to rarity and density.  all of 
them would exercise the same influence (|virt@u~) though in 
different degrees (ll. 67-9).  But where there is a variety of 
influences (and in the fixed stars this variety is acknowledged 
to exist), these must proceed from a number of constituent 
principles (|principii formali~), and not from one only. 
Consequently, rarity and density are not the sole cause of the 
difference in luminousness between the various fixed stars; and 
in the analogous case of the moon Dante is wrong in assuming this
as the cause of the difference of light and dark on its surface 
(ll. 70-22). 

	|64-66.  La spera ottava~: the sphere of the fixed stars. 
|quale~: by `quality' is here meant the colour, by `quantity' the
amount, i.e. intensity, of their light.  |Notar~, &c.: `can be 
seen to differ in appearance.' 

	|67-69.  ci@o facesser tanto~: `were the only cause of
this'; |tanto~ here = Lat. ^tantum~; cp. Par. xviii. 13.  |Pi@u e
men~, &c.: `in some cases more, in some less, in some equally
with one another.' 

	|70-72.  convengon~: here used for the impers. ^conviene~ 
-- a rare use.  |principii formali~: `formal' is here contrasted
with `material,' the ^formal~ or ^formative~ principle being that
which differentiates a thing from other things, and makes it what
it is.  N.B.  |principii formali~ here means `a ^number~ of
formal principles,' this meaning being given by the plural.  |e 
quei~, &c.: `according to your line of argument it would follow 
that all but one of these principles (viz. that of rarity and 
density) would be annulled.'  |Seguiterieno~: `would consequently
be.'  |ragion~: for ^ragionamento.~ 

	|73-78.  Ancor~, &c.: here commences the second argument 
in refutation. `Further, if rarity were the cause you are trying
to discover of this dimness (i.e. of the spots,) then either 
this planet would be in certain portions (|in parte~) thus 
defective in its matter right through (|oltre~), or -- in the 
same manner as the fat and the lean are apportioned in a body --
it (the planet) would interchange the leaves in its volume,' i.e. 
would have alternating strata of rare and dense, like leaves in a
book. 

	|79-81.  Se il primo~, &c.: `now, if the rarity passed 
right through the moon's orb, this would be apparent in an 
eclipse of the sun, because (the sun being behind the moon) its 
light would be visible through it, as when light is allowed to 
pass through (lit. introduced into) any other thin material.' 
|ingesto~ is the Lat. ^ingestus~ adapted. 

	|83-84.  cassi~: `quash,' `disprove.'  |Falsificato~, &c.:
`then your view (your explanation of the spots on the moon) 
will have been proved to be wrong,' because both alternatives 
will have been disposed of. 

	|85-105.~  The argument is: -- If the rarity does not pass
right through, there must be a certain point where the density
intervenes, and this dense stratum will reflect the sun's light
like a mirror (l. 85-90).  It may be suggested in answer, that
the reason of the dimness where the spots are is, that the point
at which the sun's light is reflected lies farther back (ll.
91-3); but this can be disproved by the experiment of placing two
mirrors at an equal distance from you and a third between them
but farther off.  Then place a light behind you as you face them,
and you will find that, though the reflexion from the third is
smaller in size, it will be equally bright with the others, thus
showing that brightness of reflected light is not affected by the
distance of the reflecting object (ll. 94-105). 

	|86-87.  un termine~, &c.: `a limit, beyond which the dense
does not suffer anything to pass.' 

	|88-90.  altrui~: the sun.  |come color~, &c.: `as colours
are reflected by a mirror'; the expression ^impiombato vetro~ is
used for a mirror in Inf. xxiii. 25. 

	|91.  tetro~: `dull,' `dark.' 

	|94-96.  instanzia~: `objection'; it is a Scholastic word, 
corresponding to the Greek
%epsilon%nu%sigma%tau%alpha%sigma%iota%sigma\.  |Ch' esser~, &c.:
`experiment, which is the usual source from which human arts are
derived.' 

	|97-99.  e due~, &c.: `and place two of them at the same 
distance from you.'  |ritrovi~: `meet your eyes.' 

	|101.  accenda~: `illuminate.' 

	|103-105.  Bench@e~, &c.: `though the more distant image
(i.e. object of sight) does not present as wide a surface as the
other two, yet you will see there (in the instance which it
furnishes) that of necessity it shines as brightly as they do.' 

	|106-148.~  Beatrice, having confuted Dante's erroneous view
of the origin of the spots on the moon, proceeds to expound the
true view.  In order to do this, she explains (1) the operation
of the stellar influences which affect the various Heavens or
spheres (ll. 112-23), and (2) the functions of the Intelligences
or Angelic Orders, by whom those influences are dispensed (ll.
127-38).  She then proceeds to prove that the brightness or
dimness of the stars is caused by the purity or alloyage of the
influence which proceeds from God and is communicated to them by
the Intelligences; and that the brightness or dimness of portions
of the moon's surface are to be explained in the same manner (ll.
139-48).  This is an ^a priori~ argument, such as the Scholastic
philosophy affected. 

	|106-108.  come ai colpi~, &c.: the effect of Beatrice's 
arguments in clearing Dante's mind from a false view is compared
to the sun's rays causing the snow to disappear from the face of
the earth.  |Della neve~, &c.: `that which lay beneath the snow 
(i.e. the face of the earth) remains clear both of the 
whiteness and the cold which it had before.' 

	|110-111.  luce si vivace~: the illuminative power of her
exposition.  |ti tremoler@a~, &c.: `it will appear to you to
sparkle,' lit. `it will sparkle in the aspect which it presents 
to you.' 

	|112-123.~  Summary: -- The celestial or stellar influences
originate in the ninth Heaven or ^Primum Mobile~ (ll. 112-4);
thence they pass into the eighth Heaven, where they are
partitioned among the fixed stars (ll. 115-7); the lower spheres
possess distinctive characteristics of their own (ll. 118-20); 
the celestial influences are transmitted downwards from one 
sphere to another (ll. 121-3).  To this we may add, though Dante
does not here state it: -- these celestial influences combine 
with the independent influences of the several spheres, as 
Aquinas says (^Summa~, i. Q. 115. Art. 3), `Actiones corporum 
caelestium diversimode recipiuntur in inferioribus corporibus 
secundum diversam materiae dispositionem.' 

	|112-114.  ciel~, &c.: the Empyrean.  |un corpo~, &c.: the 
^Primum Mobile~, `on the beneficent influence of which depends 
the being or essence of all that is contained within it,' i.e. 
of the whole universe in its different spheres.  The movement 
which is originated by the ^Primum Mobile~, and communicated by 
it to the other spheres, is to them the source of order and life
and distinctions of time; this is explained in Par. xxvii. 106- 
20; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 15. ll. 132-8 and 152-7.  Observe that the
use of the word |corpo~ here shows that Dante regarded the
spheres of Heaven as material; cp. ^cerchi corporai~ in Par.
xxviii. 64. 

	|115-117.  Lo ciel seguente~: that of the fixed stars. 
|vedute~: `bright lights,' lit. `objects of sight'; cp. the use 
of ^vista~ in Par. xxiii. 30; xxx. 9.  |diverse essenze~, &c.: 
the fixed stars, which are `contained in that heaven, but
distinct from it.' 

	|118-120.  Gli altri~, &c.: `the other spheres dispose 
their different inborn characteristics so as to produce the 
purposes for which they were intended (|lor fini~) and the 
effects which they are designed to cause (|lor semenze~).' 

	|121-123.  Questi~, &c.: `these instruments by which the 
world is regulated (|organi del mondo~), as thou dost now 
perceive, proceed in regular gradation in such a manner, that 
they receive power from above, and exercise it (lit. operate) 
below,' i.e. communicate it to the lower spheres. 

	|124-126.  Riguarda~, &c.: `give good heed to me, as I 
advance by way of this point (viz. the order of the spheres and 
their influences) to the truth which thou desirest (the solution
of the question of the spots on the moon).'  |sol tener lo
guado~: `by yourself to hold the passage,' lit. `ford'; i.e. to
explain the matter without my help.  |guado~ is used of an
explanation in Purg. viii. 69. 

	|127-148.~  Summary: -- Having described the working of 
the spheres, Beatrice now proceeds to speak of the spiritual 
agencies which regulate them.  The spheres, being inanimate, have
no active power of their own; the power which they possess 
proceeds from the Intelligence or Angelic Order which presides 
over each sphere (ll. 127-9).  In particular, the Intelligence of
the eighth Heaven communicates its influence to that Heaven (ll.
130-2), partitioning it there among the fixed stars (ll. 133-8).
This influence is modified in each star by its peculiar 
characteristics (ll. 139-41), and it is this mixed or modified 
influence which causes the brightness of the heavenly bodies, 
because in the first instance it proceeded from God (ll. 142-4).
The greater or less brightness of the stars arises from the 
greater or less purity in which they possess this influence (ll.
145, 146), and the light and dark portions of the moon's surface
are to be explained in the same manner (ll. 147, 148). 

	|127-129.  Lo moto~, &c.: `just as in the craft of the 
hammer the moving power proceeds from the artisan, so the motion
and power of the spheres must proceed, not from themselves, but 
from the Intelligences which move them.'  For the Intelligences 
which preside over the several spheres see Canto XXVIII. 

	|130-132.  il ciel~, &c.: tbe Heaven of the fixed stars. 
|mente~: the mind of the Intelligence which presides over that 
sphere: |fassene suggello~: `makes itself its seal,' i.e. in 
turn imprints it upon the separate stars. 

	|133-135.  E come~, &c.: `and as the soul within your dust 
(bodies) diffuses itself through different members, adapted to 
various faculties (sight, feeling, &c.).' 

	|136-138.  l' intelligenza~, &c.: the Intelligence of the 
eighth Heaven is meant, as in l. 131; the influence of this 
passes into the stars, but it remains one itself, and revolves 
with its sphere. 

	|139-141.  Virt@u~, &c.: `each different power forms a 
different alloy with the precious body (i.e. star) that it
quickens, with which it combines, as life does with your bodies.'

	|142-144.  Per la natura~, &c.: `owing to the glad nature 
(of God) from which it is derived, this mingled power shines 
through the body (i.e. the star), as joy beams through the 
pupil when the eye kindles.'  |lieta~: cp. ^lieto fattor~ in
Purg. xvi. 89, of God rejoicing in His works. 

	|145.  ci@o che~, &c.: `the difference in brightness 
between one star and another star.' 

	|147-148.  Essa @e~, &c.: `this is the formative principle,
which, conformably to its goodness, produces the dull part and
the bright part' in the moon.
