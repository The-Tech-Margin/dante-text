	|3.  imparadisa~: `doth imparadise,' i.e. blesses with the
joys of Paradise; cp. Par. xviii. 21. 

	|4-5.  Come~, &c.: before Dante receives a fresh revelation
of the glories of Heaven, he perceives this by anticipation in
the increased brilliancy of the eyes of Beatrice.  This is
compared to a person seeing in a mirror the reflexion of a light
behind him that is as yet invisible to him, which light, on
turning round, he finds to correspond exactly to the reflexion. 
|doppiero~: `flambeau,' `taper'; der. from Lat. ^duplus~: so
called, according to Diez, p. 368, because of its double wick. 
|se n'alluma retro~: `is lighted by it from behind.' 

	|9.  come nota~, &c.: `as a tune corresponds to the metre of
the verse to which it is set,' i.e. exactly. 

	|11-12.  Ch' io feci~: Dante saw a bright light reflected in
the eyes of Beatrice.  |corda~: `noose,' `snare.' 

	|13-15.  tocchi~: abbreviated for ^toccati~, as in Purg. iv.
137.  |ci@o che pare~, &c.: `that which may be perceived in that
Heaven, whenever (as in the present case) it is rightly regarded
in respect of its rotation.'  |volume~ from meaning `revolution'
comes to signify `revolving heaven'; cp. Par. xxiii. 112.  The
`Heaven' which is here intended is the ^Primum Mobile~, and of
this we are told in ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 9, 10, that it is
imperceptible to sense save for its motion.  In the present case
Dante's eyes are supposed to be furnished with a superhuman power
of sight, which enabled him to perceive it visibly passing before
him: this is implied in the words `is rightly regarded.'  |ci@o
che pare~, &c., cannot mean the movement of the lower and visible
Heavens regarded as an evidence of the existence of the ^Primum
Mobile~ from which that movement proceeds, because Dante was now
looking upwards, and therefore away from the lower Heavens. 

	|16-17.  Un punto~: as a point is indivisible, it is here
taken to represent the Unity of the Godhead.  It is in order to
lay stress on the indivisibility, that the minuteness of this 
point of light is illustrated in ll. 19-21.  |affoca~:
`enkindles'; `illuminates.' 

	|19-21.  quale stella~, &c.: `the star which, when seen from
earth, appears the smallest of all, would seem a moon, if placed
beside this point of light in the same way as one star is placed
by another star in the sky.' 

	|22-39.~  Dante now describes how nine concentric circles of
light, which are nine angelic Orders, revolve around the point 
which represents the Divine Unity, as their centre; and that
their brightness and the rapidity of their movement are in 
proportion to their nearness to that point.  The following are 
the angelic Orders represented by the successive circles: 1.
Seraphim; 2. Cherubim; 3. Thrones; 4. Dominions; 5. Virtues; 6. 
Powers; 7. Principalities; 8. Archangels; 9. Angels.  These are
the ^beati motori~ of the various spheres, who are mentioned in
Par. ii. 127-9.  The reason why the angelic Orders are revealed
to Dante in this Heaven is that the ^Primum Mobile~ is the sphere
from which proceed the stellar influences, and these are
dispensed by those Orders in their various spheres. 

	|22-24.  cotanto~: take with ^distante~ (l. 25); `at the
distance at which the halo seems closely to surround (i.e. as 
closely as the halo seems to surround) the luminary (sun or
moon), which furnishes its light, when the vapour on which it is
formed is densest.'  When the atmosphere is densest, the halo is
nearest to the sun or moon. 

	|27.  Quel moto~, &c.: that of the ^Primum Mobile.~ 

	|31-33.  Sopra~: `without,' i.e. outside the sixth circle. 
|sparto...di larghezza~: `ample (lit. spread out) in width.'  |il
messo di Juno~: Iris, i.e. the rainbow.  |Intero~: `were it
complete,' i.e. if it formed a perfect circle. 

	|36.  dall' uno~: `from the point of Unity.' 

	|38-39.  la favilla~: the point of light.  |di lei s'
invera~: `is imbued with its truth'; `partakes of its
perfection.' 

	|40-42.  in cura~, &c.: `in anxious suspense.'  This was due
to his eagerness to learn the meaning of this sight.  |Da quel
punto~, &c.: this is from Ar. ^Metaph.~ xi. 7. 5,
%epsilon%pi%epsilon%iota\ %delta\ %epsilon%sigma%tau%iota\
%tau%iota\ %kappa%iota%nu%omicron%upsilon%nu\
%alpha%upsilon%tau%omicron\ %alpha%kappa%iota%nu%tau%omicron%nu\

%omicron\ %omicron%upsilon%rho%alpha%nu%omicron%sigma\
%kappa%alpha%iota\ %eta\ %phi%upsilon%sigma%iota%sigma\.  |punto~
stands both for the ^punto~ of l. 16, and for the
%alpha%rho%chi%eta\ (`first cause') of Aristotle. 

	|45.  onde~, &c.: `by which it is impelled.' 

	|46-57.~  Dante here states the difficulty which he feels,
viz. that, whereas in the world of sense the spheres move more
swiftly in proportion to their distance from the centre, i.e. the
earth, the celestial circles which he is now contemplating move
more swiftly in proportion to their nearness to the centre, i.e.
God.  As the latter of these systems is the pattern of the
former, it would be natural that they should correspond. 

	|48.  Sazio~: participle, for saziato; cp. Purg. xxxiii.
138.  `The food that is set before me (i.e. the description of 
the nature and movement of these circles that has been given me)
would have satisfied me.' 

	|50.  volte~: `spheres'; cp. Purg. xxviii. 104, where the 
^Primum Mobile~ is called `la prima volta.'  |divine~: `under 
the influence of God,' as shown by the rapidity of their motion. 

	|52-54.  il mio disio~: `my anxiety for an explanation.' 
|templo~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, beyond which there is nothing
but light and love, i.e. the Empyrean Heaven; see Par. xxvii.
112. 

	|55-56.  come~, &c.: see note on ll. 46-57. 

	|58-60.  a tal nodo~: `to disentangle such a knot,' i.e. to
solve so great a difficulty.  |sodo~: `tight,' lit. `solid,'
`firm': `so tight it has become from no one having tried to untie
it.' 

	|63.  t' assottiglia~: `exercise your subtlety.' 

	|64-78.~  The argument is as follows: -- In the material 
universe the size of the spheres corresponds to the amount of 
divinely infused power (|virtute~) which they possess, and which 
is diffused by them throughout their whole range (|per tutte lor
parti~), i.e. from sphere to sphere and to the earth (ll. 64-6). 
A larger amount of the benefits thus communicated and received
below (|maggior bont@a~) is the result of a larger amount of
salutary influence (|maggior salute~), and the larger amount of
salutary influence is contained in a larger body -- supposing
always that that body has complete receptive power throughout
(ll. 67-9).  Consequently, the ninth sphere, or ^Primum Mobile~,
which is the largest, is also the highest in its nature of all
the spheres; and thus it corresponds to the first and highest
circle of the angels, that of the Seraphim (ll. 70-2).  Hence, if
you estimate the angelic circles, not by their size, as you see
them, but by the rank and relative power of the spirits which
compose them, you will perceive that each material Heaven
corresponds exactly to the Order of Intelligences that guides it,
the wider sphere to the superior, the narrower to the inferior
power (ll. 73-8). 

	|64.  corporai~: `corporal,' `material.'  This passage
affords clear evidence of Dante's belief in the spheres of Heaven
as being material. 

	|67-69.  bont@a~: in the interpretation of the passage 
which is given above this word is taken as the predicate, and 
salute as the subject, of the sentence.  |compiute~: `perfect.' 
In the case of the ^Primum Mobile~ there can be no question of 
the perfection of the receptive power throughout, though there is
in the case of the lower spheres. 

	|70-72.  costui~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, which is the 
source of motion.  |cerchio~, &c.: the first circle of the 
Intelligences is that of the Seraphim.  |che pi@u sape~: it may 
seem surprising at first sight that, whereas the Seraphim are 
usually spoken of as representing love, and the Cherubim 
knowledge, the highest degree of the latter of these powers as 
well as of the former should here be attributed to the Seraphim.
The explanation is, that the Seraphim enjoy the most intimate 
vision of God (cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 6. ll. 79-81, `li Serafini 
veggiono pi@u della prima Cagione, che alcun' altra angelica 
natura'), and consequently they possess the highest knowledge as
well as the highest love, though they only represent the latter.
See Gardner, ^Dante's Ten Heavens~, pp. 203, 204. 

	|73-75.  Perch@e~, &c.: `wherefore, if you apply your 
measure (estimate) to the virtue (rank, influence) of these 
circles, not to the circular form in which the angelic natures 
(|sustanzie^) are revealed to you,' &c. 

	|76-78.  conseguenza~: `correspondence.'  |di maggio a 
pi@u~: `of the wider sphere to the higher Intelligence.' 
|intelligenza~ the Order of heavenly beings which guides it. 

	|81.  da quella~, &c.: `on that side (lit. from that cheek)
on which he is mildest.'  The NE. wind is meant, of which
Brunetto Latini (^Tesoro~, Bk. ii. Ch. 37) says, that it keeps 
off rain and clouds (`restringe pioggia e nuvole'), whereas the 
N. and NW. winds are inclement. 

	|82-84.  roffia~: `dense vapours,' `rack.'  |paroffia~: a 
word of unknown origin, and somewhat doubtful signification; but
it probably means `retinue,' and here `pageantry'; so that what 
is intended to be expressed by it is the brilliant display of 
sunlight. 

	|88-89.  restaro~: `stayed their course', `ceased to be 
uttered.'  |ferro~, &c.: Dante employs the same comparison in
Par. i. 60. 

	|91-93.  Lo incendio~, &c.: `every spark (angel) accompanied
(flew about in the neighbourhood of) their burning train (the
coruscating circles to which they belonged).'  |s' immilla~:
`runs into thousands'; `their number runs into more thousands
than the doubling of the chess,' i.e. an infinite number.  The
story here referred to is as follows.  `The inventor of the game
of chess brought it to a Persian king, who was so delighted with
it, that he offered him in return whatever reward he might ask. 
The inventor said he wished only a grain of wheat, doubled as
many times as there were squares on the chess-board; that is, one
grain for the first square, two for the second, four for the
third, and so on to sixty-four.  This the king readily granted;
but when the amount was reckoned up, he had not wheat enough in
his whole kingdom to pay it' (Longfellow). 

	|94-96.  Io sentiva~, &c.: `I heard them sing hosanna choir
by choir to the fixed point (cp. ll. 16, 41) which holds and will
for ever hold them to the place in which they ever were.'  The
latter of these points is explained below (ll. 100-2).  The
attraction exercised by the Presence of God causes each circle of
spirits to approach as near to Him as they can, and their power
of doing so is in proportion to their ability to see Him. 

	|97.  i pensier dubi~: these questionings related to the 
different angelic circles.  The order of chese has been given in
note to ll. 22-39.  The nine circles were divided into three 
Hierarchies.  The scheme of these was derived by Dante from the 
^De Caelesti Hierarchia~ of Dionysius.  According to that work 
(cap. 7-9) the first Hierarchy comprised the Seraphim, Cherubim,
and Thrones; the second the Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; the 
third the Principalities Archangels and Angels.  See also note 
below on l. 130 

	|100-102.  Cosi~, &c.: `they follow their bonds with the 
speed which you behold.'  |vimi~: `withs,' `bonds,' Lat. ^vimen.~
The `bonds' are the attraction of love, which holds them fast to
the central point.  |Per simigliarsi~, &c.: the meaning is, that
they desire to be united with God, and to partake of His nature.
|quanto~, &c.: `in proportion as they have a higher power of 
spiritual insight.' 

	|103-105.  vonno~: for ^vanno.~  |del divino aspetto~: the 
explanation of this will be found in Par. ix. 61, 62, where the 
Thrones are said to be `mirrors by which God's judgements are 
directly revealed to us.'  |Perch@e~, &c.: `and thus they
completed (lit. whereby they concluded) the first group of 
three.'  |terminonno~ for ^terminarono~; cp. ^apparinno~ for 
^apparirono~, Par. xiv. 121.  The past tense is used because the
period of their creation is referred to. 

	|108.  Nel vero~, &c.: in God. 

	|110-111.  nell' atto~, &c.: `in the act of seeing, not in
that of loving, which is subsequent.'  This is the view of
Aquinas, who opposes the opinion of Duns Scotus, that loving is 
the higher act. 

	|112-113.  mercede~, &c.:  `meritorious works, which are the
result of the combined action of the grace of God and of good
will in the recipient of that grace.' 

	|115-117.  germoglia~: `buds,' i.e. is ever putting forth 
fresh graces.  |che notturno~, &c.: `which no autumn season 
strips of its leaves.'  As the sun is in Aries at the vernal 
equinox, in the autumn that constellation is seen at night; hence
`nocturnal Aries' stands for `autumn,' the season of falling 
leaves. 

	|118-120.  sverna~: `warbles.'  ^Svernare~ is used of birds
`chirping out winter' on the arrival of spring.  For other
passages where it signifies `warbling' see ^Vocab. Tramater.~ 
|onde s' interna~: `of which its triple nature (as a ^ternaro~) 
is composed.' 

	|121-123.  Dee~: `divinities,' i.e. divine Orders of
Intelligences.  These are similarly called ^Dei~ in Inf. vii. 
87.  In Purg. xxxii. 8 the Theological Virtues are called ^Dee.~ 
|ee~: for the form cp. Purg. xxxii. 10. 

	|124-125.  tripudi~: `dances.'  Here, as in Par. xii. 22,
the word is used of the joyous movement of the inhabitants of
Heaven.  |girano~: this line and those which rhyme with it are 
twelve-syllable lines; see note on Inf. xv. 1. 

	|127-129.  Questi ordini~, &c.: `these Orders all look
upwards (towards God), and downwards they so prevail (exercise so
powerful influence), that they all are drawn towards God, and all
draw those beneath them.' 

	|130.  Dionisio~: Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of
St. Paul at Athens (Acts xvii. 34), was the reputed author of the
^De Caelesti Hierarchia~, which has already been mentioned.  In
reality that work seems to have been written in the fifth or
sixth century.  It was translated from the original Greek into 
Latin by John Scotus Erigena (Cent. ix.), and became the text- 
book of angelic lore in the middle ages.  The names of the Orders
were derived from Scripture, for five of them, viz. Thrones, 
Dominions, Virtues, Powers and Principalities, occur in St.
Paul's Epistles (cp. Rom. viii. 38 (Vulg.); Eph. i. 21; Col. i.
16), and the remaining four, viz. Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels
and Angels, in other parts of the Bible; but the system which
Dante here gives was due to the work just mentioned. 

	|132.  com' io~: i.e. `rightly,' because Beatrice, who is
speaking, had perfect knowledge.  Dante here by implication
recants the view which he had propounded in ^Conv.~ ii. 6. ll.
43-55, for he there places the Powers in the first Hierarchy, the
Principalities in the secondand the Thrones in the third.  This 
arrangement he seems to have borrowed from Brunetto Latini, 
^Tesoro~, Bk. i. Ch. 12. 

	|133-135.  Gregorio~: St. Gregory (Pope Gregory the Great; 
Cent. vi.) differed (|si divise~) from St. Dionysius in placing 
the Principalities in the second Hierarchy, and the Virtues in 
the third (^Homiliae in Evangelia~; No. 34, {part} 7).  |di s@e 
medesmo~: `at his mistake.' 

	|136-139.  E se~, &c.: the explanation of St. Dionysius
being able, while still living on earth, to reveal to men the 
nature of the angelic Hierarchies is, that it was communicated to
him by St. Paul, who learnt it when he was caught up to the third
Heaven; cp 2 Cor. xii. 2.
