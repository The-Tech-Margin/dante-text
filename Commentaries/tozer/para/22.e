	|9.  da buon zelo~: `from righteous zeal.'  Beatrice is
referring to the cry which Dante had just heard; this, she says,
does not proceed from anger or despair, like the appalling bursts
of sound which had assailed his ears in Hell, but from elevated
feeling. 

	|10-11.  il canto~, &c.: `the song of the spirits in this
sphere and my smile'; cp. Par. xxi. 58-63. 

	|13-14.  i preghi suoi~: `its prayers,' i.e. the prayers
which combined to form the cry.  |la vendetta~: the death of
Boniface VIII is probably referred to. 

	|17-18.  ma' che~: `except'; cp. Inf. iv. 26; Purg. xviii.
53.  It is the Lat. ^magis quam~, in the sense of `otherwise
than.'  |al parer~, &c.: `as it seems to him,' lit. `according to
his view.'  The man who desires God's retribution thinks it
tarries, the man who fears it thinks it comes all too soon. 

	|21.  l' aspetto ridui~: `you turn your face round.' 
|ridui~ is for ^riduci.~  The form in French corresponding to 
^riducere~ is ^reduire.~ 

	|23.  sperule~: `little globes of light.'  |insieme~: 
`correspondingly.' 

	|26-27.  La punta~, &c.: `the urgency of his desire.'  |del
troppo~: `to exceed.' 

	|30.  Per far~, &c.: `to satisfy my wish concerning
himself,' i.e. to answer the question that was in my mind, viz. 
who he was. 

	|31-33.  dentro a lei~: within the enveloping light, which
has just been compared to a pearl.  |Li tuoi~, &c.: `you would 
express your thoughts.' 

	|34-36.  perch@e~, &c.: `that you may not delay (|tarde~ for
^tardi~) in reaching the lofty goal of your journey' i.e. the
presence of God.  |pure~, &c.: `merely to the thought' i.e. to
the thought unexpressed in words.  |si ti riguarde~: `art so 
scrupulous (lit. thoughtful) of uttering.' 

	|37.  Quel monte~: Monte Cassino, on the slope of which the
town of the same name lies.  It stands about halfway between Rome
and Naples.  The speaker is St. Benedict (480-543), the founder
of the Benedictine Order, who after spending some years in
retreat at Subiaco, migrated to Monte Cassino, and established 
the monastery, which has been the parent of all the Benedictine 
monasteries.  What is here said about St. Benedict (ll. 37-45) is
founded on a passage in the ^Dialogues~ of St. Gregory (ii. 2);
see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 77. 

	|38-39.  Fu frequentato~, &c.: St. Benedict found paganism
still existing on Monte Cassino, and a temple of Apollo at which
the people offered sacrifices.  This he persuaded them to
destroy.  |ingannata e mal disposta~: `misguided and perverse.' 

	|41.  Colui~: Christ. 

	|47.  quel caldo~: the heat of divine love. 

	|49-51.  Maccario~: St. Macarius, the Egyptian anchorite of
Cent. iv., who established the monastic rule of the East. 
|Romoaldo~: St. Romuald, who founded in 1012 the monastery of 
Camaldoli in the upper valley of the Arno for the Order of the 
Reformed Benedictines (Camaldolesi) which he established. 
|Fermar li piedi~: `abode steadfastly.' 

	|60.  con imagine scoperta~: `with unveiled form,' i.e.
without the enveloping light. 

	|62-63.  ultima spera~: the Empyrean, where the Blessed
appear unveiled, and where Dante sees St. Benedict; cp. Par.
xxxii. 35.  |e il mio~: `including my desire of satisfying you.'
If a comma be read before these words (Witte, Scartazzini), they
must be taken with ^s' adempier@a~ understood, `and my desire of
revealing myself plainly to you shall be fulfilled.' 

	|66.  @E ogni parte~, &c.: `every part is immutable and 
eternal.' 

	|67-69.  in loco~: `in space'; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 37-9,
`Esso non |@e~ in luogo, ma formato fu solo nella prima Mente.'
|non s' impola~: `does not turn on poles.'  |s' invola~: `it is
hidden'; cp. Par. xxi. 29, 30. 

	|73-75.  per salirla~, &c.: `lifts his feet from off the 
earth to mount the stairway of heavenly contemplation.'  |la 
regola mia~, &c.: `my Rule remains (on earth) only to cause waste
of paper.'  The rules of the Order are copied out but not 
observed.  |Rimasa @e~: the ^hiatus~ between these words is 
extraordinary; both the metre and the sense would be improved if
^Rimasa v' @e~ were read but there does not seem to be any 
authority for this. 

	|77-78.  spelonche~: `dens of thieves,' with reference to
Matt. xxi. 13, `speluncam latronum' (Vulg.); cp. Jer. vii. 11,
which our Lord is there quoting.  |cocolle~: `monks' dresses';
cp. ^uculla~ in Par. ix. 78.  |Sacca~, &c.: `are sacks filled
with worthless flour,' i.e. are unprofitable for good works.  For
the fem. plur. |sacca~ from ^sacco~ cp. ^le uova, le dita~, &c. 

	|79-84.  si tolle~, &c.: `rises up as an offence against
God.' |quel frutto~, &c.: covetousness in misappropriating the 
revenues of the Church, which rightfully belong to God's poor 
(|la gente che per Dio domanda~), to the purposes of nepotism 
and licentiousness.  This in the sight of God is a worse sin than
usury, though the usurers are found in the seventh Circle of the
Inferno; cp. Inf. xvii. 34 foll. 

	|85-87.  blanda~: `soft,' `yielding,' `weak.'  |gi@u non
basta~, &c.: `on earth a good commencement does not maintain its
efficacy from the springing (lit. birth) of the oak till its
acorns are formed.'  The reference is to the degeneration of 
religious institutions which, starting originally (|Dal nascer 
della quercia~) from good beginnings, lose their vitality before
their fruits are matured.  |Basta~ is here used in the sense of 
`hold out,' `maintain itself.' 

	|88-93.  Pier~, &c.: the principle just laid down is 
illustrated in the lines which follow.  St. Peter founded his 
society (the Church), and St. Benedict and St. Francis their 
Orders, in poverty and humility; but in the course of time all 
these have lost their original fair character.  For St. Peter cp.
Acts iii. 6, `Silver and gold have I none.'  |convento~: 
`society,' as in Purg. xxi. 62. 

	|94-96.  Veramente~: `nevertheless'; cp. Par. i. 10.  The 
saint concludes by adding that the case is not desperate to 
reform these institutions may require miraculous interposition 
but God worked greater miracles than this when he brought the 
Israelites into the Promised Land.'  Nevertheless the turning
back of Jordan' stream, and the retreating of the Red Sea, when
God so willed were greater miracles to behold than relief in the
present case would be.'  The mention of the Jordan and the Red
Sea is from Ps. cxiii. 3 (Vulg.), `Mare vidit, et fugit; Jordanis
conversus est retrorsum.' 

	|98-99.  collegio~: `company'; cp. Par. xix. 110.  |si 
strinse~: `closed together.'  |come turbo~: with a rushing,
whirling movement. 

	|104-105.  Naturalmente~: `by natural law.'  |ala~:
`flight.' 

	|106-107.  S' io torni~, &c.: `so may I sometime return to
the triumph of the saints.'  |Se~ introduces the usual form of
affirmation.  |per lo quale~: `for the sake of which,' `to attain
to which.' 

	|109-111.  tratto e messo~: for the inversion of the order 
in these words, the latter being put first in order to express 
the instantaneous character of the act, cp. Par. ii. 23, 24.  The
instantaneous nature of the ascent from sphere to sphere has 
already been frequently noticed.  |il segno~: the constellation 
of Gemini.  Dante has now ascended from the Heaven of Saturn to 
that of the Fixed Stars.  In the lines which follow (ll. 112-20)
he explains that Gemini was appointed as the constellation which
he should enter, because it corresponded to his birth. 

	|113-114.  dal quale~, &c.: `from which I recognize that all
my genius proceeds.'  In astrology persons who were born when the
sun was in Gemini were endowed with genius and literary ability. 

	|115-117.  Con voi~, &c.: `the sun rose and set in your 
company,' i.e. the sun was in Gemini.  As the sun entered Gemini
in the middle of May and left it in the middle of June, Dante's
birthday fell within that period.  |Quegli~, &c.: on the
periphrasis here used to describe the sun see note on Par. xxvii.
137, 138. 

	|119-120.  rota~: the sphere of the Fixed Stars.  |La
vostra~, &c.: it was ordained for me that I should be in that 
part of the heavens which is occupied by the Twins. 

	|123.  Al passo~, &c.: `to the difficult task which demands
its attention,' viz. that of describing the remaining scenes in
Heaven.  For |passo~ in the sense of `difliculty' cp. Par. iv.
91. 

	|124.  ultima salute~: God; cp. Par. xxxiii. 27. 

	|127-129.  t' inlei~: `dost approach to it,' i.e. to the 
^ultima salute~; cp. ^immiare, intuare~ in Par. ix. 81.  |quanto
mondo~, &c.: `how great a part of the universe I have (by 
conducting thee hither caused to lie beneath thy feet.' 

	|132.  Che lieta vien~, &c.: `that comes rejoicing through
this rounded ether.'  The `throng' is the Triumph of Christ,
which is described in the next Canto. 

	|133.  Col viso~, &c.: the whole of this passage which 
follows is derived from Cicero, ^Somnium Scipionis~, {parts} 3-6 
(in ^De Re Publica~, lib. vi.), where the successive heavenly 
spheres with their accompanying planets are described as seen 
from above.  There it is said of the earth -- `Iam ipsa terra ita
mihi parva visa est, ut me imperii nostri, quo quasi punctum eius
attinginius, paeniteret' ({part} 3).  And again -- `Tuni
Africanus, Sentio, inquit, te sedem etiam nunc hominum ac domum 
contemplari: quae si tibi parva, ut est, ita videtur, haec 
caelestia semper spectato, illa humana contemnito, ({part} 6). 

	|137.  ad altro pensa~: i.e. removes his thoughts from it,
and fixes them on heavenly things. 

	|139-141.  Vidi~, &c.: `I saw the moon illuminated by the 
sun.'  |quell' ombra~: the spots on the moon's face.  Dante 
supposes himself to be looking at the face of the moon which is 
opposite to that which is seen from the earth, and consequently 
the spots are hidden from him.  |gi@a~: Dante's view that the 
spots were caused by the rarity of parts of the moon's surface 
was first advanced in ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 69-76.  It is repeated
in Par. ii. 59, 60, but is there refuted by Beatrice. 

	|142-144.  tuo nato~, &c.: the Sun; cp. Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 192,
241, where the Sun is spoken of as `Hyperione natus.'  |e vidi~,
&c.: `and I saw how Mercury and Venus make their revolutions in
the neighbourhood of the sun.'  |a lui~ is to be taken with
|vicino~, but not with |circa.~  Dante is here thinking of ^Somn. 
Scip.~ {part} 14, where Africanus, who is speaking, looks from
the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, and says -- `Hunc (i.e. solem) ut
comites consequuntur Veneris alter, alter Mercurii cursus.'  The
use of the sing. verb (|si move~) with two subjects (|Maia e
Dione~) is the same which is found in many passages of the ^Div.
Com.~  |Maia e Dione~: the name of Dione is used for that of her
daughter Venus in Ov. ^Fast.~ ii. 461, and elsewhere in the
classics; and it seems to be on the analogy of this that |Maia~
is here used for the name of her son Mercury. 

	|145-147.  Quindi~, &c.: `from this point I beheld the 
tempering influence of Jupiter between his father and his son.' 
Jupiter is spoken of in Par. xviii. 68 as the ^temprata stella~,
whereas Mars was fiery and Saturn cold.  |Tra~ here bears a 
double meaning referring both to the position of these planets in
the heavens and to their natures.  |Il variar~, &c.: `the changes
in their position,' as they appear sometimes nearer to the sun, 
sometimes farther from it.  For |dove~ used substantively cp.
^suo dove~ in Par. xii. 30. 

	|148-150.  sette~: the five planets, together with the sun 
and moon.  |riparo~: lit. `place of refuge,' `shelter'; hence 
`abode.'  `How distant from each other are their abodes,' i.e.
their places in the sky. 

	|151.  aiuola~: `little plot of ground'; here the word is 
applied in contempt to the earth.  |feroci~: `proud,' like
^ferox~ in Lat.; this meaning corresponds to the sentiments 
expressed in the ^Somnium Scipionis~, where the pride of man is 
derided.  On the other hand, the resemblance of the use of the 
word ^areola~ for the earth in ^De Mon.~ iii. 16. l. 90 -- where
the importance of the Empire in preventing wars between the
inhabitants of the earth is being spoken of -- to that of 
|aiuola~ here, is in favour of rendering |feroci~ by `fierce,' 
with reference to struggles for the possession of the earth. 

	|153.  Tutta m' apparve~: taken in connexion with |dai colli
alle foci~ (`from the hills to the river-mouths'), this means
`was seen in all its details.'  This rendering avoids the
difficulty which arises from supposing that Dante intends to say
that he saw the whole of the habitable globe.  As far as his 
position was concerned, indeed, it was possible for him to do so,
if -- as seems to be implied in Par. xxvii. 79-81 -- he was on 
the meridian of Jerusalem, because that place lay midway between
Gades and the mouth of the Ganges, the western and eastern 
extremities of the habitable globe, and that area extended over 
half the circumference of the earth.  But as Dante was now in 
Gemini, and the sun was in Aries, and therefore two signs of the
zodiac to the westward of him, the easternmost part of the 
habitable globe would from this point of view be in shadow and 
invisible.
