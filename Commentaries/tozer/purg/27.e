	|1-5.  Si come~, &c.: the general meaning is: -- `the 
position of the sun as seen from the Mountain of Purgatory
corresponded to (|i stava il sole...come~) sunrise at Jerusalem,
midnight in Spain, and noon on the Ganges.'  In the notes to
Purg.  ii. 1-9 and iv. 138 it is pointed out that according to
Dante the Mountain of Purgatory was the antipodes of Jerusalem,
and the habitable world extended over half the circumference of
the globe from E. to W., the extreme limits being respectively
the mouth of the Ganges and Spain.  Here we are told that the sun
is rising at Jerusalem, and it is midnight on the Ebro in Spain,
and midday on the Ganges; consequently it is sunset in Purgatory. 
Sunset here is spoken of approximately, for the actual
disappearance of the sun is not mentioned until l. 61.  |vibra~:
`scatters.'  |L@a~: at Jerusalem.  |Cadendo~: the English
equivalent, when the position of a place relatively to the
heavenly bodies is spoken of, is `lying.'  |Ibero~: the Ebro,
Seville, Gades, the Straits, and Morocco are used
indiscriminately to represent the western limit of the world. 
|l' alta Libra~: `Libra on high,' i.e. on the meridian.  As the
sun was now in Aries, it being the vernal equinox, the middle
point of night, which was directly opposite to the sun, was in
Libra, the constellation opposite to Aries; cp. Purg. ii. 4, 5. 
Thus to say that the Ebro was under Libra is equivalent to saying
that it was midnight in Spain.  |nona~:  `noon.'  Skeat remarks
(^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `Noon') that `noon' meant originally the
ninth hour of the day, or 3 p.m., but afterwards the time of the
Church service called ^nones~ was altered,  and the term came to
be applied to midday.  In ordinary Italian ^nona~ is only used
for `nones.'  |riarse~: an absolute participle, corresponding to
|cadendo~, `the waves of the Ganges being heated by the
noon-tide.'  Translate the whole passage thus: -- `As when the
sun scatters its first rays at the place where its Creator shed
his blood, while the Ebro lies beneath Libra on high, and the
waves of the Ganges are heated by the noon-tide, such was its
position now.' 

	|6.  l' Angel di Dio~: the angel here resembles the former
ones in saying the Beatitude, but differs from them in not being
stationed at the foot of the next stairway.  His office is 
to guard the Cornice, while the angel at the stairway is the 
guardian of the approach to the Terrestrial Paradise (cp. ll. 
58-60).  It is also to be remarked that neither of these angels 
removes the last P from Dante's forehead,; and it has been 
suggested that this takes place when he passes through the fire. 

	|8.  Beati~, &c.: `blessed are the pure in heart'; this is
the Beatitude for those who have expiated the sin of Lust. 

	|10-12.  se pria~, &c.: `without first feeling the burning 
(lit. grip) of the fire.'  It is to be observed that Dante passes
through the fire unavoidably; therefore nothing can be deduced 
from it concerning his having committed the sin expiated in this
Cornice.  |di l@a~: on the further side of the flames.  The
`chant' was that of the angel, which is mentioned in l. 58.  They
are bidden to give ear to this, because its sound was to guide 
them through the fire. 

	|15.  fossa~: `pit,' referring to the punishment of 
malefactors who were set head downwards in the earth; cp. Inf. 
xix. 50. 

	|16-18.  In sulle man, &c.~: the description of the 
attitude of fear is very vivid.  Dante clasps his hands, and 
bends forward over them, peering at the flames.  |gi@a veduti~: 
`which I erewhile had seen.'  Burning was a mode of punishment at
Florence at this period, and Dante himself had been condemned to
be burnt alive at the time of his banishment. 

	|23.  esso~: this pronoun, when placed between a prep. and
its case, gives precision and is indeclinable; cp. Purg. xxxi.
96, `Sopr' esso l' acqua'; Inf. xxxiv. 41 and note.  |Gerion:
cp.~  Inf. xvii. 81 foll. 

	|29-30.  fatti far, &c.~: `put it to the test thyself with
thy own hands on the hem of thy garments.'  Dante is here
adapting the phrase `far la credenza,' which was used of
`tasters,' who secured their masters against poisoned food: see 
the instances in ^Vocab. Tramater.~ 

	|33.  Ed io pur, &c.~: `and, notwithstanding, I stood
immovable.' 

	|37-39.  Tisbe~: the Babylonian lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,
were wont to meet under a mulberry tree; and one day Pyramus
found Thisbe's veil on this spot covered with blood, and thinking
that she had been killed slew himself.  When Thisbe appeared, and
addressing her lover assured him that she was his Thisbe, he
looked up at her and then died.  Thisbe then took her own life. 
In consequence of this, in accordance with Thisbe's dying prayer,
the colour of the fruit of the mulberry changed from white to
dark.  Cp. Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 145, 146, `Ad nomen Thisbes oculos iam
morte gravatos Pyramus erexit, visaque recondidit illa': --
Thisbe says to the tree -- l. 160, `Signa tene caedis, pullosque
et luctibus aptos Semper habe foetus, gemini monumenta cruoris':
-- finally we are told that her prayer was heard -- l. 165, `Nam
color in pomo est, ubi permaturuit, ater.' 

	|48.  per lunga strada~: i.e. while we had been traversing a
length of road. 

	|57.  l@a dove, &c.~: at the point where the ascent of the
final passage commenced. 

	|58.  Venite, &c.~: Matt. xxv. 34; the words are uttered by
the Angel who guards the approach to the Terrestrial Paradise. 

	|62.  studiate il passo~: `hasten your steps.' 

	|64-66.  Dritta~: not winding, like the previous ones.  |tal
parte~: the east, because the sun, which was nearly setting,
threw Dante's shadow in front of him as he faced the Mountain. 
Thus Dante emerges from the last Cornice on the western side of
the Mountain after having started from the eastern side. 

	|67-69.  levammo i saggi~: `we made trial.'  |il sol
corcar~: this marks the end of the third day on the Mountain of 
Purgatory, and the second spent in Purgatory proper; it was 
Easter Tuesday.  |l' ombra~, &c.: `my shadow which had 
disappeared.' 

	|70-72.  pria che, &c.~: the meaning is: -- before the 
daylight and the tints of sunset had faded out of the sky.  For 
the omission of the article before |orizzonte~ cp.  Par. xiv. 69;
see also ^abisso~ in Purg. i. 46.  |dispense~: lit.
`distributions'; `ere night had spread through all its wide 
domain.' 

	|74-75.  la natura~, &c.: cp. Purg. vii. 49-57. 
|affranse.~: `broke down,' `exhausted.'  |il diletto~: `the 
pleasure'; by this is meant, not the pleasure of mountain 
climbing for its own sake, but that of ascending.  That Dante had
some experience of mountains is suggested by his descriptions of
the wide spaces of sky as seen from the mountain side (l. 70), of
camping out on the rocks (l. 73), and of the increased size and 
brightness of the stars (l. 90).  See also the note on Inf. xxiv.
19. 

	|76-87.~  In the two similes which follow the position of
the three companions is described, first from the point of view
of Dante, and next from that of Virgil and Statius. 

	|80-81.  in sulla verga~, &c.: `leans on his staff, and 
tends them as he leans.'  Instead of |lor poggiato serve~, Witte
and others read ^lor diposa serve~, i.e. `ministers repose to 
them'; but the repetition of the word |poggiato~ is quite in 
Dante's manner; see note on Inf. xiii. 25. 

	|87.  Fasciati~, &c.: `begirt on either hand by lofty 
rocks.' 

	|88-89.  del di fuori~: `of the world without.' |per quel
poco~: `in that small space of sky.' 

	|93.  le novelle~: `the intimation of it.' 

	|94-95.  Nell' ora, credo~, &c.: the planet Venus, as we 
see from Purg. i. 19, 20, was now in the eastern sky on the 
Mountain of Purgatory in early morning; the time is mentioned 
here, because `morning dreams are true'; cp. Purg. ix. 16-8. 
|credo~ is added, because Dante was asleep at the time. 

	|97-98.  sogno~: this dream, like those of the two previous
nights which Dante spent on the Mountain of Purgatory, is
symbolical of something which is about to occur in the narrative;
see note on Purg. ix. 19.  Here the figures of Leah and Rachel
foreshadow those of Matelda and Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise. 
|landa~: `plain,' `meadow.'

	|100.  Sappia~, &c.: Leah and Rachel, according to the
allegorical interpretation of the mediaeval theologians (see
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 334, 335), stand in the same relation to
one another as Martha and Mary in the New Test., Leah
representing the active, Rachel the contemplative life; cp. l.
108.  Both find their ultimate bliss in the glorified spiritual
life -- or, as it is here expressed, in seeing themselves
reflected. as in a mirror, in the face of God -- but Leah attains
it by means of good works, Rachel by means of contemplation. 

	|101-102.  vo movendo~, &c.: the words |movendo intorno 
le belle mani~ express the process of gathering the flowers; `I 
gather as I go the flowers with my fair hands to make me a 
garland.'  The gathering represents the practice of active virtue
the garland the grace and merit which accrue from it. 

	|103-104.  Per piacermi~, &c.: `to give me pleasure when 
I look in my mirror,' i.e. that I may see myself reflected 
more brightly in the face of God owing to good works.  |si 
smaga~: `withdraws her eyes from,' lit. `falls away from'; see 
note on Purg. x. 106. 

	|106.  veder~: the construction of the passage is irregular;
if fully expressed, it would be ^vaga de' suoi begli occhi, di
vederli.~  The meaning is that she desires to see herself
reflected in God. 

	|109-111.  splendori antelucani~: `the brightness that 
precedes the dawn.'  |men lontani~: the MS. authority and the 
early Commentators are about equally divided between this and 
^pi@u lontani.~  The latter reading probably arose from ^pi@u~ 
in the line above catching the scribe's eye (see Butler's note),
and also perhaps from the desire of making the antithesis of the
two clauses complete.  If ^pi@u~ is read, the explanation is,
that the farther one is from home, the more grateful it is to
turn one's face homeward; but this is very forced, while |men
lontani~ gives a natural and poetical meaning, and one that
suited Dante's present circumstances as he was drawing near to
the Earthly Paradise. 

	|115.  Quel dolce pome~: the highest good, i.e. God.  |per
tanti rami~: i.e. in so many different ways.  Men seek for the
highest good in many different forms, and often mistakenly, as
when they suppose it to be power or pleasure; but it is found in
the knowledge of God only. 

	|119.  strenne~: `guerdons.' 

	|129.  Dov' io~, &c.: as Virgil represents human reason, his
knowledge, and consequently his power of guiding others, comes to
an end at the approach to the realm of faith, i.e. the region of
beatified spirits and the presence of God: cp. Purg. xviii. 46-8. 
|per me~: `by myself.' 

	|130-132.  ingegno~: `wit,' while |arte~ is `skill.' 
|erte~: the `steep ways' represent the descent of the Poets 
through Hell, the `narrow (|arte~) ways' the passages between the
Cornices in Purgatory. 

	|133-135.  il sol~: on the level summit of the Mountain 
which they had now reached, the sun, which was fully risen but 
had hitherto been concealed by the Mountain interposing, became 
visible.  |sol da s@e~: cp. ^senza seme~, Purg. xxviii. 69; the 
explanation is given in Purg. xxviii. 112-7. 

	|136-138.  gli occhi~: of Beatrice; cp. Inf. ii. 116. 
|Seder~: this represents the contemplative, |andar~ the active 
life.  We have now reached a region of allegory, and must expect
to find recondite meanings at every turn. 

	|141.  non fare~, &c.: `not to do its bidding,' i.e. that of
the ^arbitrio.~ 

	|142.  Perch' io~, &c.: `wherefore I confer on thee plenary
jurisdiction over thyself.'  The two words |corono~ and |mitrio~
are used to strengthen by repetition the force of the expression. 
No doubt they contain a reference to the imperial and papal
crowns as being emblems of the two supreme powers which governed
the world; but they must not be regarded as implying that Virgil
conferred on Dante self-government in spiritual as well as
temporal matters; to do this would be beyond his powers, and a
usurpation of the function of Beatrice, who was Dante's spiritual
guide Consequently all reference to religious belief, and even to
religious life, in |mitrio~ must be excluded; and if anything is
intended by the passage beyond the simple meaning which has been
given above, it can hardly be more than that |corono~ should
refer to ^conduct~, and |mitrio~ to ^conscience~; and even this
seem s doubtful.  N. B. Virgil after this does not speak again,
though he accompanies Dante until Beatrice appears.
