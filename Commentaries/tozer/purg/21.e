	|1-6.  La sete natural~: the desire of knowledge is meant;
cp. ^Conv.~ i. 1. l. 66.  In the present instance it was Dante's
desire to know the significance of the earthquake and the burst
of praise; cp. Purg. xx. 145-8.  |sazia~: here used intrans., `is
quenched.' |l' acqua~: the living water, i.e. the revelation of
spiritual truth; John iv. 14, 15.  |onde~: take with |la grazia~,
`the boon of which.'  |la fretta~: Virgil's rapid progress,
referred to already in Purg. xx. 149.  |impacciata~: obstructed
by the prostrate spirits.  |condoleami~: `felt compassion.' 

	|7.  Luca~: Luke xxiv. 13 foll. 

	|10.  un' ombra~: this, as we shall see (l. 91), was the 
poet Statius.  It seems probable that he is intended to represent
allegorically philosophy as enlightened by Christianity; hence in
Canto XXV Aquinas' view of the generation of man is put into 
his mouth.  All the statements which Dante introduces with regard
to Statius' life -- his conversion, his prodigality, &c. --
appear to be his own invention. 

	|12.  ci addemmo di lei~: `did we become aware of his
presence'; |addemmo~ is from ^addare~, a verb of unknown origin,
perf. ^addiedi~: the ^Vocab. Tramater~ gives other instances of 
its use.  |si~: for ^sino~, `until'; cp. Inf. xix. 44: others 
take it as marking the consequence, `so he spoke first.' 

	|15.  il cenno~, &c.: `the corresponding greeting,' viz. 
`And to thy spirit.'  The Latin forms are `Pax vobiscum' and `Et
cum spiritu tuo.' 

	|17.  la verace corte~: the tribunal of God. 

	|19-21.  e parte~, &c.: `and meanwhile (while he was
speaking) we were speeding on our way'; for |parte~ in this sense
cp. Inf. xxix. 16.  |che Dio~, &c.: `whom God does not approve 
as denizens of heaven.'  |la sua scala~: the stairway of 
penitence, i.e. the Mountain of Purgatory. 

	|22-24.  i segni~: the P's on Dante's forehead.  |profila~:
`is wont to trace,' lit. `outlines'; the present tense here puts
the statement generally, not as applying to Dante's case only. 
|vedrai~, &c.: his being allowed to pass through the stage of
purification in Purgatory, which is preparatory to being received
into Heaven, shows that he is destined for the company of the
Blessed. 

	|25-27.  lei~: Lachesis.  Of the three Fates, Clotho placed
the flax (i.e. the allotted span of life) on the distaff 
(|impone~) and packed it together (|compila~), while Lachesis 
spun the thread of life (|fila).  Non gli avea~, &c.: `had not 
yet drawn off all the flax for him,' i.e. had not brought his 
life to an end.  The word |conocchia~ means first the distaff, 
and then the flax on the distaff. 

	|29-30.  sola~: without a guide.  |al nostro~, &c.: `does
not look at things as we disembodied spirits do,' who see things
immediately without the intervention of the senses. 

	|33.  mia scuola~: `my principles of knowledge,' i.e. the
teaching of human reason, of which Virgil is the representative;
cp. Purg. xviii. 46, 47. 

	|36.  suoi pi@e molli~: `its wave-washed base.' 

	|37.  Si mi die'~, &c.: `by his question he hit so exactly
the needle's eye of my desire.' 

	|40-57.~  Statius prefaces his explanation by saying that 
the movement of the Mountain was not, like an ordinary 
earthquake, the result of natural causes, which operate 
irregularly.  In Purgatory proper everything is regulated 
immediately by divine appointment, the working of which is 
uniform. 

	|40-42.  Cosa non @e~, &c.: `nothing here is affected 
irregularly by (|sanza Ordine senta~) the divinely appointed 
system (|la religione~) of the Mountain, or is exceptional (|fuor
d' usanza).'~ 

	|43.  Libero~, &c.: `here all is free from variations of 
whatsoever kind.'  For the omission of the substantive where `the
place' is meant cp. Purg. ix. 54; x. 79; xiv. 94. 

	|44-45.  Di quel che~, &c.: in these two lines Statius gives
the reason for the movement of the Mountain, which seems to be an
exceptional occurrence, and so to contradict the statement just
made.  He says that this takes place only when a purified soul is
passing from Purgatory to Heaven, and that its movement
heavenward is brought about by the direct agency of Heaven.  `The
cause (of what appears an unusual occurrence can proceed here 
(|Esserci puote cagione~) from a soul being received by Heaven 
(|Di quel che il ciel riceve~) into itself (|in s@e~) by its 
own agency (|da s@e~), but from naught else (|e non d' altro~).' 
|Da s@e~ means ^proprio motu~, independently of influences 
proceeding from the natural world; it is the attraction exercised
by Heaven upon the soul which causes it to rise.  Others
interpret thus -- `that which, having originally proceeded from 
Heaven (|da s@e~), the Heaven receives into itself'; but the 
brachylogy which this involves seems extravagant even in the
^Div. Com.~ 

	|46-48.  Perch@e~: `wherefore,' i.e. because there is no 
variation.  |la scaletta~: the three steps in front of the gate 
of Purgatory. 

	|50-51.  figlia di Taumante~: in mythology Iris or the 
rainbow is said to be the daughter of Thaumas.  |Che di l@a~, 
&c.: `who on earth often shifts her region.' 

	|52-54.  Secco vapor~: this `dry vapour' is the 
%alpha%nu%alpha%theta%nu%upsilon%iota%alpha%sigma%iota%sigma\
%A%xi%eta%varrho~\ of Aristotle, ^Meteorol.~  ii. 9. 20, which is
there stated to be the common cause of wind, lightning, thunder,
and earthquakes.  |ch' io parlai~: `of which I spoke'; for the
use of |che~ cp. Par. i. 27.  |il vicario~, &c.: the Angel who
guards the gate; see Purg. ix. 78, 127. 

	|55-56.  pi@u gi@u~: in the Ante-Purgatory.  |per vento~, 
&c.: Aristotle's theory of the origin of earthquakes, which 
after his time was generally accepted, was that they were due to
the action of winds, which were confined beneath the surface of 
the earth, and were endeavouring to find a vent; ^Meteorol.~ ii.
8. 

	|59-60.  surga~: `rises from the ground'; this applies to
the prostrate spirits in this Cornice, while |si mova~ refers 
to those in the other Cornices.  |tal grido~: the singing of the
^Gloria in excelsis.~  |seconda~: `accompanies the spirit.' 

	|61-66.~  Statius now explains what is the evidence of a 
soul being freed from the stain of sin, its purgation being 
accomplished.  In order to understand his meaning, we must 
observe that there are two forms of will in man -- the higher 
(|voler, voglia~), which is always aiming at the highest good,
i.e. God and heavenly things; and the lower (|il talento~), which
is fixed on inferior objects, and thus precludes the exercise of
the higher will.  This lower will during man's life on earth 
tends towards sin; in Purgatory by a special dispensation of God
it is fixed on the punishment, and the desire of undergoing this
restrains the action of the higher will.  When the purgation is 
completed, the function of the lower will ceases, and the higher
will immediately exerts itself, so that the soul tends upwards 
towards Heaven. 

	|62-63.  Che~, &c.: `which (higher will) seizes the soul,
when it is wholly free to change its company, and it (the soul)
rejoices in exercising that will.'  For |convento~ cp. Par. xxii.
90. 

	|64-66.  Prima vuol ben~: `before that (i.e. before it has
accomplished its purification) it has the right desire to rise,
but it is prevented from doing so by the lower will, which the
justice of God fixes on (i.e. causes to long for) the purgatorial
suffering, just as it was previously fixed on the sin, in
opposition to the higher will.' Thus the longing for Heaven is
suspended, being excluded by the craving for purgatorial
suffering. 

	|68.  Cinquecento~, &c.: in Purg. xxii. 92, 93 Statius says
that he passed more than 400 years in the fourth Cornice, where
the spiritually slothful are purified.  As he died about 96 A.D.,
this would leave about 300 years to be accounted for to bring up
the date to 1300 A.D.  This period, we may suppose, was spent in
Ante-Purgatory. 

	|69.  Libera~, &c.: `unimpeded desire of a better abode.' 

	|72.  che tosto~, &c.: this is a prayer on Statius' part; 
`may he soon, I pray, send them on high.' 

	|73-75.  ei si gode~: `one enjoys'; this is the impersonal 
use of the verb with ^ei, egli.~  |quant' ei~, &c.: `how much he
benefited me'; for |prode~ see note on Purg. xv. 42. 

	|76.  la rete~: the net which holds the souls in Purgatory
is the desire of expiatory suffering; cp. l. 64. 

	|81.  mi cappia~: `that I may understand by your words, 
why,' &c.  |cappia~ is subjunct. from the neut. verb ^capere~, 
which means `to have sufficient room'; cp. Par. iii. 76; xvii.
15.  The full form of the phrase here used would be `questo mi 
cape nell' animo,' `there is room for this (lit. this has room) 
in my mind,' and |che mi cappia~, which is an abbreviated
expression, signifies `that I may understand'; see ^Vocab.
Tramater~, s.v. `capere.' 

	|82.  Nel tempo, &c.~: the dates of the birth and death of
Statius are not certainly known, but they were about 45 and 96
A.D. (Teuffel, ^Hist. of Rom. Lit.~ i. p. 123, Engl. Trans.). 
Thus the capture of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 A.D. would fall in
the middle of his lifetime. 

	|83.  le fora~: `the wounds'; ^fori~ is used in the same 
sense in Purg. v. 73.  Statius speaks of the destruction of 
Jerusalem by Titus as an act of retribution for the crucifixion 
of Christ.  Dante derived this view from Orosius, who says of 
Titus that `ad vindicandum Domini Iesu Christi sanguinem iudicio
Dei fuerat ordinatus,' ^Hist.~ vii. 3. 8. 

	|85-87.  pi@u onora~: `bestows most honour'; the name here 
meant is that of poet.  |con fede~: i.e. a Christian.

	|88-90.  vocale spirto~: `gift of song.'  |Tolosano~: in
reality Statius was a native of Naples.  Dante's error as to his
having been born at Toulouse was derived from Lactantius, who in
his commentary on the ^Thebaid~ confounds him with a rhetorician
of Toulouse of the same name.  |mirto~: the meed of success in
poetry.  Dante here puts into Statius' mouth his own estimate of
that poet; in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 6. ll. 79-81 he mentions under
the title of standard poets Virgil, Ovid, Statius, and Lucan. 

	|92-93.  Cantai~, &c.: the works of Statius which were known
to Dante were his ^Thebaid~ and ^Achilleid.~  His ^Silvae~ were
unknown at that time in Italy.  |caddi in via~, &c.: Statius 
died before he had completed the ^Achilleid.~ 

	|94.  ardor~: `poetic fervour.' 

	|97-99.  Eneida~: at the conclusion of the ^Thebaid~ Statius
says, apostrophizing his work -- `nec tu divinam Aeneida tenta,
Sed longe sequere, et vestigia semper adora,' ^Theb.~ xii. 816,
817.  |mamma.~: `mother.'  |fermai~: `weighed'; lit. `made
stationary in the scale,' i.e. balanced. 

	|101-102.  assentirei~, &c.: `I would agree to remain a year
more than I am bound to do with a view to (i.e. as the condition
of) my escape from my place of exile.'   Purgatory is regarded as
the place of exile for those who are destined to be denizens of
Heaven. 

	|105.  non pu@o tutto~, &c.: `the power that wills is 
limited in its influence.' 

	|106-108.  Ch@e riso~, &c.: `for smiles and tears follow so
directly on the feelings from which they respectively arise, that
in the most truthful spirits they follow less the will,' i.e. the
more candid a man is, the less they are under his control. 

	|111.  ove~, &c.: `where expression mostly dwells.' 

	|112.  se tanto~, &c.: `so mayest thou accomplish well thy
great task'; i.e. the task of visiting the world of spirits. 

	|121.  Forse che~: `maybe that'; for ^che~ attached to
^forse~ cp. Purg. iv. 98; xxxiii. 46. 

	|128.  e credi~: `and believe that the cause was.' 

	|133-135.  quantitate~: `intensity.'  |vanitate~:
`unreality,' `incorporeal state.'
