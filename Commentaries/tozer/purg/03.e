PREFATORY NOTE ON THE SPIRITS IN ANTE-PURGATORY

	The spirits who are detained for a time in Ante-Purgatory
are the Negligent, or those who deferred their repentance until
the end of their lives.  They are divided into four classes.  (1)
Those who, while they repented at the last moment, died under the
ban of the Church; example Manfred (Canto III).  (2) Those who
delayed their repentance through indolence; example Belacqua
(Canto IV).  (3) Those who repented at the moment of a violent
death; examples Buonconte da Montefeltro, Sordello, &c.  (Cantos
V, VI).  (4) Kings and Princes, who deferred their repentance
owing to the cares of state; numerous examples (Canto VII).  The
first of these classes is precluded from entering Purgatory for a
period thirty times the length of the duration of their contumacy
(Purg. iii. 136-9).  The other three classes are detained for a
period equal to that of their life on earth (Purg. iv. 130-2; xi.
127-31).  But in every case the term of waiting may be shortened
by means of the intercessions of friends on earth.  Dante meets
with the groups of spirits who represent these four classes at
different stages in the ascent of the mountain.  Group I is found
at the foot of the precipice which runs round the base of the
mountain (Purg. iii. 46 foll.).  Group II is at some distance
above the precipice on the open mountain side (Purg. iv. 46 foll. 
and 97 foll.).  Group III is higher up again in the same
direction (Purg. iv. 136 and v. 22, 23).  Group IV occupies a
flowery valley, which forms a recess in the slope of the hill
nearer to the gate of Purgatory (Purg. vii. 64 foll.). 

	|1-3.  Avvegnach@e~: `although'; Dante here contrasts the 
conduct of the spirits with his own.  |ove ragion ne fruga~: 
`towards which reason impels (lit. goads) us.'  The meaning is, 
that our human judgement -- i.e. our sense of right and wrong, 
and our feeling of God's justice -- impels us towards Purgatory,
in order to satisfy the demands of justice and to obtain 
purification. 

	|4.  compagna~: for ^compagnia~, the abstract `company' 
being here used for the concrete `companion'; cp. the use of 
^guida~ (fem.) for `guide,' and ^scorta~ for `escort.' 

	|7.  da s@e stesso rimorso~: `self-reproached,' i.e. on 
account of his delay. 

	|10-11.   la fretta~: Virgil had hurried after the other 
spirits.  |l' onestade~, &c.: `deprives every movement of 
dignity'; for the sentiment cp. Purg. vi. 63 `onesta e tarda.' 
|dismaga~: lit. `takes away'; on ^dismagare~ or ^smagare~, which
is used in different senses in the ^Div. Com.~, see note on Purg.
x. 106. 

	|12-13.  ristretta~: `circumscribed'; his attention was 
confined, first to Casella's music, and afterwards to Cato's 
reproofs.  |Lo intento~, &c.: `widened its field of vision.' 
|vaga~: `eager to inquire.' 

	|15.  pi@u alto si dislaga~: `rises highest above the 
waters'; ^dislagarsi~ is derived from Lat. ^lacus~, and here 
means `to withdraw itself from the waters.'  This interpretation
is confirmed by Par. xxvi. 139, where the Mountain of Purgatory 
is called `il monte, che si leva pi@u dall' onda.' 

	|16-18.~  Lo sol~: i.e. the sun's rays.  |alla figura~, &c.:
`tracing the shape formed by his rays falling upon me,' lit. `to
the figure which the resting-place of his rays on me had.' 
|appoggio~ is here used of that which intercepts the light. 

	|21.  Solo~, &c.: in the darkness of the Inferno Dante had
no opportunity of observing that Virgil cast no shadow; he now
discovers it for the first time. 

	|22-23.  pur~: take with |diffidi~; `why do you still 
mistrust me after all that I have done for you?'  |tutto
rivolto~: `turning full towards me,' to dispel my doubts. 

	|25-26.  Vespero~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `My body is in
Italy, where it is now evening.; It was at this time about 6.30
a.m. in Purgatory, and consequently 6.30 p.m. at Jerusalem, which
was its antipodes; and as Italy was reckoned as being halfway
between Jerusalem and Gades, and therefore 45+o to the westward
of the former place, the equivalent of which in time is three
hours, the time of day here intended by |Vespero~ is about 3.30
p.m.  ^Vespero~ is used by Dante to signify the part of the day
from 3 to 6 p.m.  Cp. note on Purg. xv. 6. 

	|27.  Napoli~: Virgil died at Brundisium in 19 B.C., and 
his remains were transferred to Naples and buried there. 
|Brandizio~: Branditz is the Proven$cal form of Brindisi. 

	|28-30.  nulla s' adombra~: `nothing is cast in shade,' 
i.e. no shadow falls.  |Che l' uno~, &c.: the point of the 
comparison is the diaphanous nature of the spheres; `which 
(heavens) do not obstruct the passage of a ray from one to 
another.'  |Che~ means `of which,' and |l' uno~ is subject of 
|ingombra~; lit. `of which heavens the one does not impede the 
passage of a ray to the other.'  The heavens, according to Dante,
formed a system of concentric spheres of which the earth was the
centre and these spheres were material, but permeable to light. 

	|31-33.  A sofferir~, &c.: the question naturally arises 
-- `If spiritual bodies, like Virgil's, are permeable to light, 
how can they suffer pain?'  Virgil answers -- `They do so, but
how this comes to pass is a mystery, of which God has not
vouchsafed the explanation.'  Translate: -- `The Supreme Goodness
(|la virt@u~) disposes bodies of the same substance as mine
(|simili corpi~) to suffer torments arising from heat and cold,
but he wills not that his mode of working (|conie fa~) should be
revealed to us.'  |tormenti caldi e gieli~: the torments of Hell 
are spoken of in these terms in Inf. iii. 87. 

	|35-36.  Possa trascorrer~, &c.: `Can traverse the
illimitable way, Which the one Substance in three Persons 
follows' (Longf.): The doctrine of the Trinity is here introduced
as being the highest mystery of the Godhead; the mysterious God 
moves in a mysterious way.  The `way' is the path of God's
counsels. 

	|37.  al quia~: `with the fact'; `be contented with knowing
the fact, without inquiring the reason.'  |quia~ is used for
`that' in mediaeval Latin. 

	|38-39.  se potuto~, &c.: if human reason had been able to
comprehend the whole scheme of God's counsels, Adam would not 
have sinned, because he would have understood the reason of God's
prohibition; and so the Incarnation would not have been
necessary.  |era~: for ^sarebbe stato~; see note on Inf. xxix. 
38. 

	|40-42.  E disiar~, &c.: a further proof is here given of 
the inability of the human intellect to fathom God's counsels; 
had this been possible, the great philosophers of old would have
accomplished it, whereas they have failed to do so, and thus have
lost everything.  `And ye (mankind) have been cognizant of the 
fruitless longings of men of such force of intellect (|Tai~) that
(had they possessed the knowledge of divine things) those desires
on their part would have been fulfilled, which now are assigned 
to them as their eternal bane.'  |vedeste~, like ^State~ and 
^aveste~ above, refers to ^umana gente~: |lutto~: cp. Inf. iv. 
42, `senza speme vivemo in disio.' 

	|44.  molti altri~: the eminent and virtuous heathens who 
were in Limbo, among whom was Virgil himself.  This is the source
of his distress.

	|48.  indarno~ &c.: i.e. legs however active could not scale
it. 

	|49.  Tra Lerici e Turbia~: as Lerici is on the gulf of 
Spezia, and Turbia stands on the heights above Monaco, the 
district here intended is the mountainous coast of the Riviera 
the eastern and western extremities of which are marked by those
two places.  Under the Roman empire this region was traversed by
good roads, as it is at the present day, but during the middle 
ages difficult tracks afforded the only means of communication. 
This is referred to again in Purg. iv. 25, where the descent to 
the town of Noli on the western Riviera is mentioned as a
specimen of a bad road. 

	|52.  cala~: `has a gradual descent,' lit. `slopes.' 

	|56.  del cammin la mente~: `the character of the path.' 

	|58-60.  una gente~: these were the spirits who formed 
the first class of the Negligent, i.e. those who died
excommunicate, though they had made their peace with God at the 
last (see Prefatory Note to this Canto).  |lente~: the slowness 
of their movements corresponds to the tardiness of their
repentance. 

	|64.  libero piglio~: `cheerful look'; for |piglio~ cp. 
Inf. xxiv. 20. 

	|67-69.  Ancora~, &c.: `that band of souls was still 
distant a good stone's cast from us (still distant, I mean, after
we had advanced a thousand paces towards them).'  |Dico~ explains
|ancora di lontano.~ 

	|72.  Come~, &c.: `as one pauses to look who advances 
hesitatingly.'  The cause of their perplexity and fear was that 
Dante and Virgil were walking towards the left, whereas the rule
in Purgatory was that a right hand course should be followed. 
Hence the spirits are seen approaching from the left (l. 58), and
they cause the Poets to turn with them (l. 101).  It was not 
Dante's being in the body that surprised them, for that they had
not yet discovered (see l. 88). 

	|73-75.  ben finiti~: `happy in your death.'  |si aspetti~: 
`is waited for by you, `meaning' is in waiting for you.'  

	|76-78.  giace~: `slopes'; cp. Inf. xxiii. 31.  |perder 
tempo~, &c.: a sort of proverbial expression; `the man of 
experience especially dreads waste of time.' 

	|83.  Addossandosi a lei~: `crowding on to her., 

	|85.  la testa~: `the foremost., 

	|88-90.  color dinanzi~: `those in front.'  |Si che~, &c.: 
`so that my shadow was thrown towards the rock.'  The Poets now 
had the mountain on their right hand and the sun on their left; 
consequently Dante's shadow was thrown towards his right in the 
direction of the precipice. 

	|101.  Tornate~, &c.: `turn round and pass on in front of 
us.'  |intrate~: lit. `enter on the road,' `advance.' 

	|104-105.  cosi andando~: `as you proceed,' without
stopping.  |di l@a~: `in the other world.'  |vedesti~: as
Manfred, who is here speaking, died in 1266, it was impossible
that Dante, who was born in 1265, should have seen him. 

	|107.  Biondo~, &c.: one of the old chroniclers describes 
Manfred as `homo flavus, amoena facie'; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p.
359. 

	|112-113.  Manfredi~: Manfred, illegitimate son of the 
emperor Frederic II, was crowned king of Sicily in 1258, but was
excommunicated by successive Popes, and by them Charles of Anjou
was summoned to oppose him.  Their armies met in 1266 at
Benevento, where Manfred was defeated and slain.  There is no 
historical evidence of his penitence, which Dante implies in this
passage; see ll. 121-3.  |Nepote~: he avoids mentioning his
father, because he was illegitimate.  |Costanza~: wife of the 
emperor Henry VI, and mother of Frederic II.  She is introduced 
in the Paradiso in the Heaven of the Moon. 

	|115-116.  figlia~: Constance, who married Peter III of 
Aragon, and was mother of Frederic king of Sicily and James king
of Aragon.  |Dell' onor~, &c.: i.e. the two princes just
mentioned.  As Dante speaks of them elsewhere in unfavourable 
terms (Par. xix. 130-8; ^Conv.~ iv. 6. ll. 180-3; ^De Vulg.
Eloq.~ i. 12. ll. 36, 37), it is necessary to regard this 
favourable estimate as that of their grandfather who is speaking. 

	|117.  il vero~: i.e. that he is in the number of the saved. 
His object in saying this is to intimate that her prayers can
avail for him; see ll. 142-5.  He does not desire to rehabilitate
his character, for the spirits in Purgatory, unlike those in
Hell, do not desire to be favourably remembered by the living;
see note on Purg. xiii. 150. 

	|119.  due~: those mentioned in ll. 108 and 111. 

	|121.  peccati~: Villani (vi. 46) describes him as dissolute
and irreligious.

	|124~ foll.  Villani (vii. 9) says that Manfred's body was
buried under a heap of stones at the foot of the bridge of
Benevento; and that by some it was reported (though he would not
himself affirm it), that by the orders of Clement IV the bishop
of Cosenza removed it from that spot, because it was ground
belonging to the Church, after which it was buried on the banks
of the Verde. 

	|126.  Avesse~, &c.: `had read aright this page in God's 
word,' i.e. the passages which speak of God's infinite mercy to 
the penitent sinner.  |questa~ refers to ll. 122, 123.  |faccia~:
for ^facciata~, page. 

	|128-129.  co~: for ^capo~; cp. Inf. xx. 76.  |mora~:
`cairn', the heap of stones piled over him by Charles of Anjou's
soldiers: ^moriccia~ in Ital. is `a pile of rubbish.'  Diez (p. 
217) compares ^moraine.~ 

	|131-132.  regno~: the kingdom of Naples.  |quasi lungo:~:
`near the banks of.'  |il Verde~: now the Garigliano, on the
confines of the kingdom of Naples and the Campagna, which was 
papal territory.  |a lume spento~: lights were extinguished at 
the funeral of an excommunicate person.

	|133-135.  Per lor~, &c.: `souls are not so utterly lost 
through their malediction (i.e. that of the rulers of the 
Church), that the eternal love (the mercy of God) cannot be 
regained, so long as hope has aught of green,' i.e. while there 
is a particle of hope -- in other words, while a man has still 
time for repentance.  On |fior~ used in this sense see note on 
Inf. xxxiv. 26. 

	|138.  da questa ripa in fuore~: `without this bank,' i.e. 
outside this steep rock which bounds the precincts of Purgatory. 

	|139-140.  Per ogni...presunzion~: `thirtyfold the time
which he has lived in a state of defiance.' 

	|142.  far lieto~: `advance my happiness,' by aiding to 
shorten the time of my exclusion. 

	|145.  Ch@e qui~, &c.: `since we who are in Purgatory can 
be greatly benefited by the prayers of those on earth.'
