	|3.  giovi~, &c.: `profit by my warnings,' lit. `let it
profit thee that I call thy attention., 

	|4-6.  Feriami~, &c.: the time is apparently about 4 or 5 
p.m., since the sun is getting low in the west.  This is 
indicated by two circumstances; (1) the blue of the western sky 
is turned pale by his light; and (2) his rays strike Dante on the
shoulder, which indicates a low altitude; see Moore ^Time-Ref.~
p. 108.  |Mutava~, &c.: `was turning all the western sky from a 
blue to a white hue,' lit. `into a white tint from being blue.' 

	|7-9.  pi@u rovente~: the red hue of fire is deepened 
when seen in shade.  |pure a tanto indizio...poner mente~: 
`notice merely so slight a token' of my being more than a shade. 

	|11-12.  cominciarsi~, &c.: `they began to say to one
another, "that does not look like an unreal body."' By |fittizio~
the a,erial body of the shades is intended. 

	|14-15.  con riguardo~, &c.: they were anxious not to delay
their purification even for a moment. 

	|16-18.  O tu~: the speaker here is Guido Guinicelli. 
|sete~: i.e. the desire to know Dante's condition; cp. the use 
of the word in l. 20. 

	|21.  fredda Indo~: the metrical ^hiatus~ between these 
words is exceptional.  |Etiopo~: the geographical authorities 
whom Dante followed placed the Ethiopians in the extreme south of
Africa, and therefore, according to them, in the Tropics; cp. 
Oros. i. 2. 88; Brun. Lat. ^Tesoro~, Bk. iii.  Ch. 4. 

	|25-26.  fora~, &c.: `I should have revealed myself'; |fora~
is for ^sarei~, |manifesto~ for ^manifestato.~ 

	|29.  Venia gente~, &c.: the first of these two bands is 
composed of the incontinent who have not violated the laws of 
nature, the second of those who have done so; this distinction is
explained in ll. 76-87. 

	|31-32.  farsi presta~: `hasten.'  |baciarsi~: the kiss 
of brotherly love in Purgatory takes the place of the kiss of 
sensual indulgence in the former life. 

	|34-36.  Cosi~, &c.: in this simile of the ants Dante is 
thought to have borrowed his information from a passage in 
Pliny's ^Natural History~ (xi. 109, 110), where the habit of 
that insect which is here mentioned is described in a very 
similar manner.  Dante, however, does not elsewhere betray any 
knowledge of Pliny's work, though he mentions him among famous 
prose writers (see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 7).  It seems more 
probable that the remarks which he introduces here are the result
of personal observation.  Any one who watches two lines of ants 
meeting, and notices how they nose one another in passing, will 
understand what he means by his simile.  |Forse~, &c.: `perchance
to inquire about their road and the prospects of their journey.' 

	|37-39.  Tosto che~, &c.: `soon as they break off the 
friendly greeting, and ere they move a footstep from their 
meeting-place,' lit. `before the first footstep passes on 
there.'  |Sopragridar~: `to outcry (cry louder than) the other.' 

	|40-42.~  The examples of the vice, two in number, are here
recited by the spirits; the former of them, which is taken from
Scripture, is that of Sodom and Gomorrah; the latter, which 
is taken from the classics, that of Pasipha,e.  |Soddoma~: Gen. 
xix. 5.  |Pasife~: Pasipha,e, in order to have intercourse with a
bull, entered the figure of a wooden cow, the `falsa vacca' of 
Inf. xii. 13: cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 24, 25; Ov. ^Ars Amat.~ i. 
325.  Pasipha,e represents the brutishness of unrestrained 
indulgence; see note on l. 83. 

	|43-45.  Rife~: the Rhipaean mountains were an imaginary 
chain of mountains in northern Europe, in the existence of which,
however, both the Greeks and the Romans believed.  Among Dante's
geographical authorities they are mentioned by Solinus, xvii. 1,
by Orosius, i. 2. 52, and by Isidore, ^Orig.~ xiv. 8, who says, 
`Riphaei montes in capite Germaniae sunt, a perpetuo ventorum 
flatu nominati (%rho%iota%phi%eta\).'  |Volasser~: `might fly.' 
The mood shows that the description of the flight of the cranes 
is hypothetical, and this lessens the difficulty involved in the
Poet's seeming to describe flights of cranes going northwards and
southwards at the same season, whereas they fly in one direction
in spring, in the other direction in autumn.  That the same 
season is not intended is clear from l. 45; but some awkwardness
remains, for the point of the passage is the two bands
separating, and this is accentuated by |parte...parte.~  |l'
arene~: the parched country of the south. 

	|47-48.  primi canti~: the hymn mentioned in Purg. xxv. 121,
while |il gridar~ is the recitation of the examples, ^ibid.~ ll.
128-32.  |che pi@u~, &c.: `which suits best their particular
case.' 

	|52.  lor grato~: `their desire,' lit. `that which was 
pleasing to them.' 

	|55.  acerbe~: from meaning `unripe' (Purg. xi. 117)
^acerbo~ comes to mean `in an early stage'; hence |acerbe n@e 
mature~ signifies `neither in youth nor in age.' 

	|58-60.  per non~, &c.: that my eyes may be enlightened 
by the sights of the spiritual world.  |Donna~: the Blessed 
Virgin; cp.  Inf. ii. 94.  |ne~: `for us,' i.e. for men in
general.  |il mortal~: cp. `this mortal' of 1 Cor. xv. 53 (Engl.
Trans.). 

	|61-63.  se~, &c.: `so may your highest longing (the desire
of the higher life) soon be satisfied.'  |pi@u ampio~, &c.:
`extends most amply.'  The heaven here meant is the Empyrean, 
where all the souls of the Blessed abide, though they revealed 
themselves to Dante in the lower spheres; see Par. iv. 28 foll. 
and note there.  This heaven encircles all the other heavens. 

	|64.  acciocch@e~, &c.: `that hereafter I may commit your 
answer to writing'; lit. `may mark paper with it.'  Since among 
the spirits in Purgatory there was no desire to be remembered on
earth, as there was among those in Hell, the appeal here must be
to their desire to obtain the prayers of the living on their 
behalf. 

	|72.  s' attuta~: `is quieted'; the word is probably derived
from Lat. ^tutus.~ 

	|73.  marche~: `marches,' `domains'; cp. Purg. xix. 45. 

	|76-78.~  La gente~: this is the band composed of those 
who in their incontinency had violated the laws of nature.  |Di 
ci@o~, &c.: Dante appears to have here combined two stories which
are told by Suetonius (^Vita Iul. Caes.~ c. 49) with regard to 
Caesar's youthful debaucheries with Nicomedes king of Bithynia --
one to the effect that his soldiers on the occasion of a triumph
sang a ribald song about them, the other that on another occasion
a person named Octavius addressed him as `Queen.'  Dante's
authority, however, was probably not Suetonius, with whose 
writings he appears not to have been acquainted, but Uguccione da
Pisa, in whose ^Magnae Derivationes~ the incident is narrated 
in the same manner as in Dante, the two original stories being 
similarly amalgamated.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 149. 

	|81.  aiutan~, &c.: the meaning is, that the sense of shame
by its moral influence acts coincidently with the physical
punishment in producing the purgatorial purification. 

	|82-84.  ermafrodito~: the mythical figure Hermaphroditus, 
being a compound of both sexes, is taken by Dante as a type of 
unlimited indulgence in sensuality between the two sexes; hence 
the use of the adjective `hermaphrodite' here.  |umana legge~: 
the law of reason and conscience, which assigns the due limits to
such intercourse, whereas animals are led by appetite only.  This
passage has sometimes been interpreted as referring to the baser
form of unnatural crime, viz. intercourse with the lower animals;
but it is to be observed that in the corresponding part of the 
Inferno (Cantos XV, XVI) this vice is not mentioned.  This being
so, it would be strange to find it introduced in Purgatory,
especially in the cases of men like Guido Guinicelli and Arnaut
Daniel, for whom Dante had so great respect. 

	|85-87.  si legge~: `is recited.'  |schegge~: the planks 
which formed Pasipha,e's wooden cow. 

	|90.  Tempo~, &c.: `it is not a fitting time to tell their
names,' because the sun is getting low.  |non saprei~: i.e. ^non
saprei dire~, `I could not tell them, because they are so
numerous that I do not know them all.' 

	|91.  Farotti~, &c.: `I will satisfy in sooth (|ben~ for 
^bens@i~) thy desire of knowing me': the construction is, ^ti 
far@o scemo di voler saper chi sono io~, lit. `I will make thee 
void of the wish to know who I am'; cp. ^vuoi saper chi semo~ in
l. 89. 

	|92-93.  Guido~: Guido Guinicelli of Bologna, the best 
of the Italian poets before Dante, and the originator of the 
`dolce stil nuovo' (on which see Purg. xxiv. 55-7 and note); born
circ. 1230; from the present passage we learn that he died before
1300, the date of Dante's Vision.  He is referred to also in
Purg. xi. 97.  |e gi@a~, &c.: `and I am already purging myself
(without having to delay in the Ante-Purgatory) because I fully
repented before arriving at the end of my life'; i.e. he had not
deferred his repentance, like the Negligent. 

	|94-95.  Quali~, &c.: when Hypsipyle was about to be put 
to death by Lycurgus king of Nemea, who believed that she had 
caused by her negligence the death of his son Opheltes (|la 
tristizia di Licurgo~), she was recognized and saved by her two 
sons, Euneus and Thoas.  Statius (^Theb.~ v. 720-2) says of the 
recognition -- `per tela manusque Irruerunt, matremque avidis 
complexibus ambo Diripiunt flentes.'  It is to this that Dante 
compares the impetuosity of his feelings on finding himself in 
the presence of Guido Guinicelli. 

	|96.  non a tanto~, &c.: `I do not rise to such a height of
feeling,' i.e. `I am not so carried away,' for fear of the
flames; cp. l. 102. 

	|98.  miei miglior~: `my masters'; notwithstanding the
unusual self-depreciation on Dante's part which this involves,
this seems to be the right rendering. 

	|105.  l' affermar~: `the form of assurance,' viz. an oath;
cp. ^giuraro~, l. 109. 

	|106-108.  Tu lasci~, &c.: `thou art leaving so marked and 
clear an imprint on my memory by reason of the words I hear, that
the waters of Lethe cannot obliterate or obscure it.'  The 
impression of which Guido speaks is Dante's declaration in ll. 
55-60 that he is still in the body, and his explanation of the 
object of his journey. 

	|112-114.  detti~: `lays.'  |vostri~: Dante here uses the 
dignified |vostri~ for ^tuoi~, as addressing his master; just as
he uses ^voi~ for ^tu~ in addressing Brunetto Latini in Inf. xv.
30: see note on Purg.  xxxiii. 92.  |l' uso moderno~: the use of
the vulgar tongue in writing of Love.  |i loro inchiostri~: `the
very ink with which they were written.' 

	|115-117.  questi~: Arnaut Daniel, the Proven$cal poet of 
the latter half of Cent. xii., who, like Giraut de Borneuil 
mentioned below, is often referred to by Dante in the ^De Vulg. 
Eloq.~  It was from him that Dante got the ^sestina~; cp. ^De V.
El.~ ii. 10. ll. 24-8.  |Fu miglior~, &c.: `was a better
craftsman of his mother tongue,' i.e. of the Proven$cal 
dialect. 

	|118-119.  Versi~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `he surpassed in
literary skill all writers of his time, whether they composed in
verse or in prose'; and this is equivalent to saying that he was
superior to all Proven$cal and all French writers, for Dante
tells us in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 10. ll. 12-20) that
everything in vernacular prose was written in the ^langue
d'o,il~, i.e. French.  The expressions |Versi d' amore~ and
|prose di romanze~ are used to signify writers in those two forms
of composition.  At first sight, indeed, the words seem to imply
that he surpassed all other writers in romances in prose; but 
Dante cannot have meant this, for Arnaut Daniel never wrote any 
prose romances.  The high estimate of his poetry which is here 
given was shared by Petrarch (cp. ^Trionfo d' Amore~, iv. 40-2),
but modern writers take a different view.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~,
pp. 50, 51. 

	|120.  quel di Lemosi~: Giraut de Borneuil of Limoges, a 
contemporary of Arnaut Daniel.  He introduced into the Proven$cal
lyrical poetry a more popular element, and this may have been the
reason why Dante did not appreciate him.  The general opinion has
been that he is superior to Arnaut Daniel. 

	|121-123.  voce~: `a popular cry.'  |Prima~, &c.: `before 
the principles of art or right judgement get a hearing from 
them.' 

	|124-126.  Guittone~: Guittone d' Arezzo; see Purg. xxiv. 56
and note, and cp. ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 6. ll. 85-9, where Dante
again depreciates Guittone.  |Di grido~, &c.: `passing on in loud
tones from mouth to mouth his praise and his only (|pur lui~),
until in most men's minds the truth has mastered him'; i.e. 
until a true judgement has declared against him. 

	|128.  chiostro~: Paradise. 

	|131.  Quanto~, &c.: i.e. omitting the last petition,' Lead
us not into temptation,' &c., which is not applicable to those in
Purgatory; cp. Purg. xi. 22-4. 

	|133-134.  per dar, &c.~: `to make room for others who
chanced to be near him,' lit. `according as (|secondo Che~) he 
had them near.'  If a comma is read after |secondo~, that word 
should be taken with |loco~; but in any case |altrui~ cannot 
refer to Arnaut, because he is said to have been in front, ll. 
116, 136. 

	|136-138.  Io mi feci~, &c.: `I advanced a little towards
the person designated'; cp. ll. 115, 116.  |E dissi~, &c.: `and I
said that my desire of knowing him prepared me beforehand to 
welcome his name.' 

	|139.  liberamente~: `frankly,' i.e. without waiting for
further solicitation. 

	|140-147.  Tan m' abelis~, &c.: these lines, in which Arnaut
Daniel addresses Dante, are in the Proven$cal language.  The
following is Longfellow's literal verse translation of them,
altered in some points so as to suit the Oxford Text.  `So
pleases me your courteous demand, I cannot and I will not hide me
from you.  I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go; Contrite I see
the folly of the past, and blissful see the hoped-for joy before
me.  Now do I supplicate you, by that power Which guides you to
the summit of the stairs, Be mindful in due season of my pain.' 
|Consiros~: lit. `thoughtful,' connected with Lat. ^considerare.~
|iauzen~: Lat. ^gaudens.~  |Ara~ = ^ora.~  |Sovenha vos~, &c.:
i.e. pray when the occasion offers that my time in Purgatory may
be shortened.
