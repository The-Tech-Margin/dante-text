	|1-3.  Contra~, &c.: `ill strives the will against a better
will'; this refers to Adrian's dismissal of Dante at the end of
the preceding Canto, which the latter was forced to accept. 
|Trassi~, &c.: i.e. though only half satisfied by the answers he
had received, he forbore from asking further questions. 

	|4-6.  il Duca mio~, &c.: `my Guide advanced through the 
unoccupied spots on the Cornice close to the wall of rock.'  It 
is explained in ll. 7-9 that this line of passage through the 
prostrate spirits, though narrow, was preferable to that on the 
outer side towards the precipice, which was still narrower on 
account of the spirits being more numerous in that direction. 
|per muro~, &c.: this describes the `alure,' as the footway is 
called, which runs along near the top of the wall inside the 
battlements in mediaeval fortifications. 

	|7-9.  che fonde~, &c.: `who distil through their eyes drop
by drop the all-pervading vice of avarice.'  |Dall' altra~, &c.:
`in the opposite direction (to the wall of rock) approaches too
near to the outside.' 

	|10-12.  Maledetta~, &c.: the sight of the crowds of victims
which are found in this Cornice calls forth this imprecation on
Dante's part.  |lupa~: the wolf from its insatiable hunger is
symbolical of avarice or covetousness; cp. Inf. i. 49, 50. 
|cupa~: `ravenous,' lit. `hollow,' `deep'; it here expresses the
`void' of hunger. 

	|13-15.  par che si creda~: `men, as we know, believe'; 
|par~ does not here imply doubt on Dante's part; he has already 
affirmed in Purg. xvi. 73 that human affairs are affected by 
celestial or planetary influences; cp. also ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 
25-30.  |Quando~, &c.: `when will the man arise by whom this 
beast is to be expelled?'  This is the `coming man' of Dante's 
anticipations, who is foreshadowed in the ^Veltro~ of Inf. i. 
101, where his campaign against avarice is spoken of in similar 
terms. 

	|17.  Ed io~: understand ^andava.~ 

	|19.  udi'~: the voice, as we afterwards learn (l. 49), is
that of Hugh Capet; by him the examples of the virtue appropriate
to this Cornice are recited -- viz. the Blessed Virgin,
Fabricius, and St. Nicolas.  These are rehearsed by day, while
the examples of the vice are given by night (ll. 100-2).  

	|23.  quell' ospizio~: the stable at Bethlehem. 

	|25.  Fabbrizio~: Fabricius, the Roman consul, who rejected
the bribes of Pyrrhus, and died so poor that he was buried at the
public expense; Dante refers to him in a similar manner in ^De
Mon.~ ii. 5 ll. 90-9. 

	|28.  piaciute~: here used for ^piacenti.~ 

	|32.  Niccolao~: the two former examples represented
virtuous poverty; this one represents liberality.  St. Nicolas of
Myra portioned three sisters in order to save them from a life of
infamy. 

	|37-39.  Non fia~, &c.: because Dante would obtain the 
intercessions of the living in his behalf.  |quella vita~, &c.: 
`that (mortal) life which hastens to its close'; cp. Purg.
xxxiii. 54, where human life is called `un correre alla morte.' 

	|40-42.  non per conforto, &c.~: this probably means, that 
he had no virtuous descendants whose prayers would avail him. 
|grazia~: cp. Purg. xiv. 79, 80; in both passages the reference 
is to Dante's passing in the body through the world of spirits. 

	|43-44.  mala pianta~: the Capetian dynasty.  |aduggia~: 
`casts a blighting shade over'; see note on Inf. xv. 2.  As this
family in 1300 A.D. ruled in France and Naples, they might be 
said to overshadow the Christian world. 

	|46-48.  Doagio~, &c.: the reference is to the cruel 
treatment of Flanders (the chief towns of which were Douai, 
Lille, Ghent, and Bruges) by Philip the Fair in 1299.  The 
`vengeance' which is here imprecated arrived in 1302, when the 
French were defeated with tremendous loss in the battle at 
Courtrai.  |giuggia~: for ^giudica~; from ^giuggiare~, Fr. 
^juger.~ 

	|49.  Ugo Ciappetta~: Dante seems here to have fallen 
into a confusion between Hugh Capet and his father Hugh the 
Great, who was duke of France and count of Paris.  It was the 
latter to whom the (fictitious) story was attached that he was 
the son of a butcher (l. 52); and it was he who secured the reins
of power (ll. 55, 56); and it was due to the influence which he 
obtained that, thirty years after his death in 956, his son 
became king and founded the Capetian dynasty (ll. 57 -60). 

	|50.  i Filippi e i Luigi~: for two centuries and a half 
-- that is, from 1060 to 1316 -- there was either a Philip or a 
Louis on the throne of France. 

	|52.  beccaio~: the last three vowels of this word are 
pronounced as one syllable; cp. ^primaio~, Purg. xiv. 66. 

	|54.  renduto~: ^rendersi~ was the expression for `becoming
a monk'; cp. Inf. xxvii. 83.  Dante seems here to have fallen
into a further confusion between the Carlovingians, who
immediately preceded the Capets and must be the |regi antichi~ 
here mentioned, and the Merovingians, the last of whom, Childeric
III became a monk, whereas Charles of Lorraine, the last 
representative of the Carlovingian line, certainly did not do so. 

	|55-57.  Trovaimi~, &c.: `I found that I had a tight grip 
of the reins of government of the kingdom.'  |Di nuovo acquisto~:
`newly acquired.'  |e si~, &c.: `and I found myself so well 
provided with friends'; |Trovaimi~ is repeated here, |mi~ being 
accus., not dat. as in l. 55. 

	|58-60.  vedova~: `bereaved of its former sovereigns.' 
|dal quale~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `who founded the line of 
kings just mentioned (l. 50), whose persons (lit. bones) were 
consecrated by unction.' 

	|61-63.  Mentre che~, &c.: Hugh Capet proceeds to trace the
history of his descendants, and shows that greed of gain was 
their dominant motive.  The meaning here is -- `So long as the 
sense of shame was not lost to my race, as it was through the 
great dower of Provence, though it (my race) possessed small 
power, yet it did no wrong.'  The `great dower of Provence' was 
the accession of that important province to the kingdom of France
through the marriage of Charles of Anjou with the daughter of 
Raymond Berenger, count of Provence. 

	|64-66.  Li~: `at that point'; the seizure of the
neighbouring provinces commenced in the reign of Philip the Bold
(1270-85).  who obtained possession of Poitou and the kingdom of
Navarre; his successor (|poscia~) Philip the Fair (1285-1314) 
annexed Gascony and Ponthieu in Picardy, which were ceded to him
by Edward I in 1294, with a secret understanding, afterwards 
repudiated, that the cession was to be formal only; Normandy was
taken from John as early as 1203, but the English claim on it was
not renounced until the time of Philip the Fair, so that Dante 
may perhaps be excused for relegating its acquisition by the 
French monarchy to the later period.  |per ammenda~: the kings of
France made amends for crime by committing greater crimes.  The 
threefold repetition of the phrase in the rhyming lines adds 
force to the irony; cp. the emphasis given by the triple 
repetition of ^vidi~ in rhyme in Par. xxx. 95-9.  |Ponti~: the 
final vowel of this word is accented, and therefore unelided, 
because it stands for the French Ponthieu. 

	|67-68.  Carlo~: Charles of Anjou defeated Conradin, the 
last of the Hohenstaufen, at Tagliacozzo in 1268, and afterwards
executed him.  As this took place before the reign of Philip the
Fair, |per ammenda~ here must be taken as signifying `in amends 
for' previous acts of aggrandizement, not those for which Philip
was responsible. 

	|69.  Tommaso~: the story (now discredited) that St. Thomas
Aquinas was poisoned by Charles's orders was currently believed
in Dante's time. 

	|70-71.  non molto dopo ancoi~: `not far off at this
moment'; the time intended is the year 1301; see below.  |ancoi~
= ^anche oggi.~ cp. Purg. xiii. 52.  |Che tragge~, &c.: `when 
another Charles advances'; for |tragge~ intrans. cp. Purg. ii. 
71.  This Charles is Charles of Valois, who in 1301 came into
Italy on the invitation of Boniface VIII to settle the disorders
of Florence.  By his aid the party of the Black Guelfs triumphed,
and the Whites, including Dante, were banished. 

	|73-74.  la lancia~, &c.: treachery is meant. 

	|76-78.  terra~: his nickname was Sans-terre.  |pi@u grave~,
&c.: `his doom in Hell will be the more grievous, because he
makes light of such crimes,' and therefore will not repent of 
them. 

	|79-81.  L' altro~: Charles II, king of Apulia, son of
Charles I of Anjou.  |che gi@a~, &c.: `who lately was set free 
(|gi@a usci~), after having been taken as a prisoner from his 
vessel (|preso di nave~).'  He was taken prisoner by Roger di 
Lauria, admiral of Peter of Aragon, in an engagement in the Bay 
of Naples in 1284, and was released in 1288.  |vender~, &c.: 
`sell his daughter under a bargain,' lit. `and make a bargain for
her.'  He gave his young daughter in marriage to the aged Marquis
of Este, Azzo VIII, on consideration of receiving a large sum of
money.  |dell' altre schiave~: `with other female slaves';
`other,' because the daughter was thus treated as a slave. 

	|85-87.  Perch@e~, &c.: `as if to cast into shade by
contrast the crimes, past and future, of my descendants.'
|Veggio~, &c.: Hugh Capet here prophesies the ignominious 
treatment of Boniface VIII by the agents of Philip the Fair at 
Anagni in 1303.  |lo fiordaliso~: the ^fleur-de-lys~ on the 
banner of France.  |catto~: `made captive.' 

	|90.  vivi ladroni~: the `living malefactors' who insulted
the Pope as contrasted with those who died in company with
Christ.  They were Sciarra Colonna and William of Nogaret. 

	|91-93.  il nuovo Pilato~: Philip the Fair.  |Porta~, &c.: 
`he directs the sails of his cupidity against the Temple.' 
Philip proceeded against the Order of the Templars in 1307. 

	|95-96.  che nascosa~, &c.: `which, while it is hidden from
us, causes thine anger to repose peacefully in the heart of thy
secret counsels'; the certainty with which God foreknows the
coming of the vengeance causes him to suppress all immediate 
tokens of his wrath: for the sentiment cp. Par. xxii. 16. 

	|97-99.  Ci@o ch'~, &c.: this was Hugh Capet's mention of 
the poverty of the Virgin in ll. 19-24; Dante's request for an 
explanation (|chiosa~, lit. `comment') was in ll. 34-6.

	|100-102.  |@e risposta~, &c.: `this trait in the Virgin's
character is the answer to our prayers which presents itself to
us.'  |prece~: for ^preci~, poet. for ^preghi.~  |Contrario
suon~: the repetition of examples of the vice and its results;
thus the virtue and the vice are fittingly associated with day
and night respectively; cp. l. 121.  |in quella vece~: `instead
thereof'; cp. Purg. xvi. 36.

	|103~ foll.  The arrangement of the examples of the vice of
avarice which are here given is, that three derived from
Scripture -- viz. Achan, Ananias and Sapphira, and Heliodorus --
are placed between two sets of two from the classics, viz. (1)
Pygmalion and Midas, (2) Polymestor and Crassus.  Scartazzini
remarks that these seven correspond to the seven results of
avarice as given by Aquinas. 

	|103-105.  Noi,~ &c.: `we repeat the story of Pygmalion.' 
He was Dido's brother, who killed her husband Sychaeus for the 
sake of his possessions; cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 346-52, where the 
titles of traitor, robber, and parricide, which Dante assigns to
him, find their justification.  Obs. that ^patricida~ or
^parricida~ is sometimes used in Ital., as here, of kindred 
murder in general. 

	|106.  la miseria~, &c.: the disastrous results of his 
turning whatever he touched into gold, as described by Ovid,
^Met.~ xi.  106-130. 

	|109-111.  Acan~: Josh. vii. 16-25.  |si che~, &c.: `so 
that he seems (to the imagination) to be still suffering the 
results of Joshua's sentence.' 

	|113.  i calci~, &c.: `the hoof-beats which Heliodorus 
received.'  When Heliodorus attempted to rob the treasury of 
Jerusalem, there appeared `a horse with a terrible rider upon 
him....and smote at Heliodorus with his fore-feet,' 2 Macc. iii.
25. 

	|114-115.  in infamia~, &c.: i.e. his infamy is proclaimed
throughout the circuit of the Mountain.  |Polinestor~:
Polymestor, king of Thrace the murderer of Priam's son Polidorus,
who had been entrusted to his keeping; his was the `auri sacra 
fames'; cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 59-57; Ov. ^Met.~ xiii. 429-38. 

	|116-117.  Crasso~, &c.: the story is, that after the defeat
and death of Crassus in Parthia, Orodes, the king of that
country, caused molten gold to be poured into his mouth in 
contempt of his rapacity.  It is not clear from what source Dante
obtained this; the Latin author in whom it occurs is Florus
(^Epit.~ iii. 11), and Dante does not seem otherwise to have 
been acquainted with his writings.  Perhaps he found it in some 
mediaeval collection of stories. 

	|120.  Ora a maggiore~, &c.: take with |dir~; `to speak, now
with stronger, now with weaker tones'; |passo~, lit. `pace,' but
it cannot imply movement, because the spirits here are restricted
to one spot. 

	|121-123.  al ben~, &c.: this is said in answer to Dante's 
inquiry in ll. 35, 36, why Hugh Capet's voice was heard alone: 
`in proclaiming the virtuous examples, which are spoken of here 
in the daytime, I was not alone just now (though you thought so);
but no other person in this neighbourhood spoke in tones 
sufficiently loud for you to hear him.' 

	|126.  quanto~, &c.: this probably refers to the narrowness
of the track they had to follow; cp. 1. 5. 

	|130-132.  non si scotea~, &c.: the movement of the 
Mountain is compared (not very appositely) to that of Delos, 
which was shaken by the waves when it was a wandering island, 
before Latona took up her abode there, and brought forth her twin
offspring.  Dante had in his mind the lines in which Ovid
describes this -- `Instabilemque locum Delos dedit.  Illa duobus
Facta parens,' ^Met.~ vi. 191, 192.  Virgil relates how Apollo
subsequently made it fast; ^Aen.~ iii. 75-7.  |li due occhi,
&c.~: Apollo and Diana -- the Sun and the Moon. 

	|133-134.  un grido~: this burst of praise proceeds from 
all the souls throughout the whole Mountain; cp. Purg. xxi. 35, 
36.  Both it and the quaking of the Mountain celebrate the 
completion by a soul of its time of purgation, as is explained in
Purg. xxi. 58-60.  |inver di me~, &c.: Virgil's object was to
calm Dante's fears arising from the overpowering sound. 

	|136.  Gloria~: this word is here metrically a trisyllable,
which it is not elsewhere in the ^Div. Com.~, and its final vowel
is not elided before that which commences the following word. 
This is due to its forming part of a Latin quotation, for in
Dante as a rule every syllable of Latin words is pronounced
separately, and their final vowels are not cut off.  For
instances of the former use cp. Purg. xxiii. 11; Par. xv. 29;
xviii. 91: of the latter Purg. ii. 46; x. 44. 

	|138.  Onde~, &c.: `from whose mouths one could distinguish
the words of the cry.' 

	|139.  Noi stavamo~: the ^i~ of |Noi~ forms metrically a 
separate syllable owing to the ^st~ of |stavamo~ following; for 
similar instances see note on Inf. viii. 11. 

	|140-141.  i pastor~: the shepherds of Bethlehem.  |ed 
ei~, &c.: `and it (the hymn of praise) was concluded.' 

	|145-148.  Nulla~, &c.: `no ignorance ever caused me to be 
desirous to know with so great anxiety...as that which methought
I then felt, when I reflected on the circumstances (the
earthquake and the thanksgiving).'  |guerra~ means `struggle or 
strain of the feelings.'  |sapere~: `to know the explanation.' 

	|149-150.  la fretta~: the speed of Virgil's progress.  |N@e
per me~, &c.: `nor of myself could I discover aught in the matter
(|li~).'
