	|1.  La concubina~, &c.: `The concubine of Tithonus old' is
the Lunar Aurora, i.e. the lightening of the eastern sky which
precedes the rising of the moon.  Dante has transferred Tithonus
from the period before sunrise, with which he is usually 
associated in fable, to the period before moonrise; and, while 
regarding the Solar Aurora as his true wife, he treats the Lunar
Aurora, since she occupies an inferior position, as his
concubine.  The time which is thus described is about 8.45 p.m.,
for the moon three nights after the full, which it was now 
supposed to be, would rise about 9 p.m.; see Moore, ^Time-Ref.~,
p. 86.  |Titone~: this form instead of ^Titono~ is used also by
Petrarch, ^Trionfo della Morte~, ii. 5; and may be paralleled in
Dante by such forms as ^pome~ for ^pomo~, Purg. xxvii. 45: 

	|2.  s' imbiancava~: `was gathering light'; the Lunar 
Aurora was beginning to appear.  |balco~: `balcony'; from this 
she was supposed to be looking forth; cp. Tasso, ^Ger. Lib.~ ix.
74. 1, 2, `L' Aurora intanto il bel purpureo volto Gi@a
dimostrava dal sovran balcone.'  Others read (not so well) 
^balzo~, giving that word the sense of `terrace.' 

	|3.  Fuor delle braccia~: `leaving the embraces' of
Tithonus. 

	|4.  Di gemme~, &c.: i.e. a bright constellation was shining
just above where the light appeared. 

	|5-6.  freddo animale~: the constellation of Scorpio.  That
the animal here intended is the scorpion is shown by the next
line, for that reptile strikes with its tail, which cannot be
said of any other animal represented among the constellations. 
Dante was probably thinking of Ovid, ^Met.~ xv. 371, `Scorpius 
exibit caudaque minabitur unca.'  The epithet ^freddo~ is applied
elsewhere in Italian poetry to the scorpion; see the instances 
given by Moore, ^op. cit.~, p. 83; it probably refers to the 
effect of the poison, as Brunetto Latini says (^Tesoro~, Bk. v. 
Ch. 1), when speaking of serpents, `Tutti i veneni sono freddi.'
The determination of this point is of the first importance for 
the interpretation of the passage, for the moon would be within 
the sign of the Scorpion at the time of night given above; and 
this corroborates the view that ^La concubina~, &c., is the Lunar
Aurora; Moore, p. 86. 

	|7.  de' passi~, &c.: `the steps by which night rises' can
hardly be anything else than the hours between sunset and
midnight; |sale~ naturally refers to the first half of the night.
If |passi~ is taken, as it is by some, of the four ^watches~ of 
the night, the force of |sale~ is lost, because in that case it 
must apply to the whole night. 

	|8.  nel loco ov' eravamo~: i.e. in Purgatory; cp. Purg. ii.
8, `L@a dove io era.' 

	|9.  E il terzo~, &c.: i.e. the third hour had passed its
middle; it was more than two hours and a half after sunset.  This
at the equinox would correspond to 8.45 p.m.  The view here
maintained, that the time which Dante intends in the whole of the
above passage is early night, and that ll. 1-3 describe the 
approach of moonrise, is that which has been generally adopted 
from the earliest times; Moore, p. 85.  The other view, which
also finds its advocates, that dawn in the ordinary acceptation
of the word is meant, seems to be excluded from consideration by
the interpretation of the |freddo animale~ and the |passi~ which
has just been given.  Scartazzini s reading ^Titan~ for |Titone~
has very little in its favour. 

	|10-12.  quel d' Adamo~: the burden of the flesh; cp. Purg.
xi. 44.  This is said in contrast to the condition of the
spirits, who could feel no fatigue.  |cinque~: viz. Nino and 
Conrad, in addition to Dante, Virgil, and Sordello. 

	|15.  primi guai~: `its early sorrows'; the allusion is to
the tragic story of Tereus, Philomela, and Procne.  According to
the version of the legend which is commonly found in the Latin 
poets, Philomela was changed into a nightingale and Procne into a
swallow, while according to that which prevailed among Greek 
writers, Philomela became a swallow and Procne a nightingale. 
Dante follows the latter of these, for the sorrows of the swallow
which are here spoken of are the sufferings of Philomela, and in
Purg. xvii. 12, 20 he identifies Procne with the nightingale. 

	|17-18.  e men~, &c.: `and less captive to its (worldly) 
imaginations.'  |Alle sue~, &c.: lit. `is almost gifted with the 
power of divination (i.e. is almost prophetic) in respect of its
visions.'  The idea that morning dreams are true is a familiar
one; cp. Inf. xxvi. 7, `presso al mattin il ver si sogna.' 

	|19.  In sogno~: Dante has a dream on each of the three 
nights which he spent on the Mountain of Purgatory; the second is
that of the Siren in xix. 1-33, the third that of Leah in xxvii.
94-108.  Each takes place immediately before dawn; and each
begins with the words `Nell' ora,' and in connexion with this 
some feature of the morning hour is noticed.  In every case,
also, the dream is symbolical of something that follows in the 
narrative: the present dream symbolizes Dante's being transported
to the gate of Purgatory by the aid of Lucia. 

	|22-24.  Ed esser~, &c.: `and methought I was at the place 
where,' &c., i.e. on the summit of the Trojan Ida, where
Ganymede, son of one of the kings of Troy, was carried off by the
eagle of Zeus, when he was hunting there: see Virg. ^Aen.~ v.
252-7; Ov. ^Met.~ x. 155-61.  |sommo consistoro~: the `supreme 
consistory' was the conclave of the Gods, where Ganymede became 
cupbearer. 

	|25-27.  Forse~, &c.: Dante thus explains to himself in his
dream how it came to pass that Ida was the scene of what happened
to him.  `Maybe the eagle strikes its prey only in this place
from habit (or association),' because it had done so before 
in the case of Ganymede.  |in piede~: `in its claws.' 

	|28-30.  roteata~: `after wheeling.'  |foco~: the region of
fire, which according to Dante's system intervened between our 
atmosphere and the moon; Par. i. 79 foll. 

	|33.  convenne che~, &c.: `my slumber of necessity was
broken.' 

	|34.  Achille~: the story of Achilles awaking in the island
of Scyros, whither his rnother Thetis had carried him from his
tutor Chiron on Mount Pelion, is taken from Statius, ^Achill.~ 
i. 247 foll. 

	|39.  li Greci~: Ulysses and Diomede, who on behalf of the
Greeks -- since it was fated that Troy could not be taken without
the help of Achilles -- went to Scyros, and persuaded him to
leave the island; cp. Inf. xxvi. 61, 62. 

	|40-42.  si come~: `just as,' `at the moment when.' 
|spaventato~: the cause of Dante's fear was the changed
circumstances in the midst of which he woke.  These changes were
(1) the absence of three of his escort (l. 43); (2) the time that
had elapsed (l. 44); (3) the place in which he was (l. 45). 

	|43-44.  solo~: the three other spirits, since they could
not yet enter Purgatory, had remained behind.  |il sole~, &c.:
the time is now about 8 a.m. 

	|48.  Non stringer~, &c.: `do not draw in, but put out, all
your force.' 

	|50-51.  balzo~: `rampart of rocks.'  |l@a~, &c.: `at the 
point where there seems to be a break in the encircling rocks.' 

	|52-54.  Dianzi~: `just now.'  |dentro~: `within thee.'  |@e
adorno~: `the place is adorned'; for the omission of the subst.
cp. Purg. x. 79; xiv. 94. 

	|55.  Lucia~: his patron saint, who comes to his aid here,
as she had done at the former great crisis of his life; see notes
on Inf. ii. 97, 98.  The illuminative grace of God, which she 
represents, enables Dante to approach Purgatory and read its 
lessons aright. 

	|58-59.  l' altre~: Nino and Conrad.  |forme~: `spirits';
this is the Scholastic use of the word, the spirit being the
`form' or essential part of man; cp. Par. iv. 54.  |come~: `as
soon as.'  |chiaro~: even Lucia is bound by the rule of
Purgatory, that nothing can be done during the night. 

	|62.  Gli occhi suoi belli~: the story of St. Lucy having 
plucked out her eyes lest they should cause the ruin of a young 
man who was enamoured of them, and of their being miraculously 
restored to her, is given in Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary 
Art~, vol. 2, pp. 615-7.  |entrata~: the passage through the 
cliff leading to the gate; cp. l. 51. 

	|68.  lo balzo~: cp. l. 50. 

	|70-72.  innalzo~, &c.: the description of the steps which 
lead to the gate of Purgatory, and of everything connected with 
Dante's reception there, is highly symbolical, and is expressed 
in correspondingly elaborate ideas and language.  |rincalzo~: 
`fortify,' lit. `prop.' 

	|73-76.  eravamo~, &c.: `our position (point of view) was 
such that I saw.'  |fesso~, &c.: `a rift broken through a wall'; 
the confined passage corresponds to the `strait gate' and `narrow
way which leadeth unto life.' 

	|78.  un portier~: the angel who is thus described is the 
Guardian of the gate of Purgatory.  He symbolizes the power of 
absolution possessed by the Church (l. 117), and by implication 
the office of the priest-confessor, whose functions are dwelt on
in ll. 121-9. 

	|86.  la scorta~: `your escort'; the angel implies, by
asking this question, that he knew that Dante and Virgil were not
spirits destined for Purgatory, and that therefore he expected
them to be under some special guidance. 

	|88.  Donna~: Lucia, ll. 61, 62. 

	|94-102.~  The three steps in front of the gate of Purgatory
represent the three stages of penitence.  The interpretation of
their symbolism which best corresponds to the features that Dante
assigns to them is, that the first, with its white colour and
mirror-like surface, signifies candour and sincerity of spirit in
confession; the second, with its dark rough surface broken
across, is the hard heart, darkened by grief and contrite; while
the third, with its bright red colour, symbolizes ardent love. 
The characters in the Gospel history which have been regarded by
Christian writers as representative of these three stages are --
of the first (candid confession) the penitent thief on the cross;
of the second (contrition) Peter in the judgement hall; of the
third (ardent love) Mary Magdalene at the banquet. 

	|96.  quale io paio~: i.e. `my very image'; `I saw my image
reflected in it.' 

	|97-99.  perso~: `purple-black'; see note on Inf. v. 89. 
|crepata~, &c.: it is tempting to adopt Miss Rossetti's
suggestion (see Butler, p. 107), that what is here intended is 
two transverse cracks in the stone, figuring the cross, at the 
thought of which the heart is contrite.  Perhaps, however, the 
meaning rather is, that the stone was cracked throughout its 
whole length and breadth.

	|100.  s' ammassiccia~: `rests ponderously.' 

	|105.  diamante~: it is hard to say whether `adamant' or 
`diamond' is meant here, for the word was used in both senses: 
Perhaps the former is preferable, in which case the allegorical 
meaning will be the firm foundation on which the Church, which 
has the power of binding and loosing, is established -- `on this
^rock~ I will build my Church.' 

	|106.  di buona voglia~: `with my good will,' i.e I
willingly followed his drawing. 

	|110-111.~  Misericordia, &c.: `I besought his mercy that he
should open to me.'  |nel petto~, &c.: `I smote myself thrice on
the breast,' in token of contrition. 

	|112-113.  Sette P~: the seven P's, which the angel
inscribes on Dante's forehead, signify the seven deadly sins, P 
being the initial letter of ^Peccato.~  The sword is the emblem 
of the divine justice.  |lavi~: `cleanse away by passing through 
Purgatory.'  In Dante's case both the inscription of the letters
and their removal are only symbolical, and do not imply that he 
was at this time suffering any Purgatorial penance; this is shown
by his recognizing that he will have to undergo the pains of 
Purgatory after death, Purg. xiii. 133-8. 

	|115.  che secca si cavi~: `which is dug dry from the
ground.'  Ashes and dust (dry earth) are the familiar emblems of 
penitence. 

	|117.  due chiavi~: these are the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven: The golden key is the power of absolution, the silver key
the knowledge possessed by the confessor, which enables him to 
judge of the condition of the penitent.  Hence in opening the 
gate the silver key is used first, the golden afterwards.  On 
this subject Aquinas says -- `distinguuntur duae claves, quarum 
una pertinet ad iudicium de idoneitate eius qui absolvendus est,
et alia ad ipsam absolutionem'; ^Summa~, P. 3. Suppl. Q. 17. Art.
3. 

	|120.  Fece~, &c.: `he plied (lit. dealt with) the gate in
such a manner as to satisfy me,' i.e. he opened it. 

	|121-123.~  I' una~: `one,' i.e. either; if either of the
confessor's functions is exercised amiss, the absolution is not
valid.  |calla~: `opening,' `entrance'; see note on Purg. iv. 22. 

	|124-126.  Pi@u cara~, &c.: the golden key is the more
precious, because its power is derived from the precious blood of
Christ; but the silver key demands exceedingly great skill in 
him who uses it.  |troppa~: for ^troppo~; Dante has allowed
himself for the sake of the rhyme, to introduce an irregular 
grammatical construction in making |troppa~ agree with |arte.~ 
|il nodo disgroppa~: `disentangles the knot,' i.e. clears the 
conscience and enlightens the mind. 

	|127-129.  Pier~: St. Peter, to whom Christ committed them.
|Pur che~, &c.: a humble request for pardon is the indispensable
condition of obtaining it. 

	|130-132.  l' uscio~, &c.: `the door of entrance to the 
sacred gateway.'  |di fuor torna~: i.e. will have to return and 
quit Purgatory.  The spiritual sense is -- `The man who after 
repentance returns to his former sins forfeits God's favour.' 

	|133-134.  quando~, &c.: `when the pivots of that sacred 
gate turned in their sockets.'  |regge~ is regularly used of 
church doors; see ^Vocab. Tramater.~ 

	|136-138.  Non rugghi@o~, &c.: `Tarpeia roared not so
loudly, nor showed itself so discordant'; the grating of the 
pivots, which is compared to this, is intended to imply the 
infrequency of the opening of the gate of Purgatory; cp. Purg. x.
2, ^disusa.~  This view is in accordance with Dante's own 
sternness, notwithstanding his mention of the merciful commission
given by St. Peter to the angel in ll. 127, 128.  The classical 
story here alluded to, which is taken from Lucan, iii. 114-68, 
describes how Julius Caesar, when he reached Rome after passing 
the Rubicon, proceeded to the temple of Satum, which served as an
^aerarium~ or state treasury, in order to make himself master of
its contents, but was opposed by the tribune L. Caecilius
Metellus, who was ultimately removed by force.  The lines in 
Lucan referring to this are -- `Protenus abducto patuerunt templa
Metello.  Tunc rupes Tarpeia sonat, magnoque reclusas Testatur 
stridore fores,' ll. 153-5.  `The Tarpeian rock' is here taken
for the Capitoline Hill, on one side of which it was situated,
and which is described as echoing the grating of the hinges of
the temple of Saturn, which lay at its foot.  Dante has rendered
an elaborate allusion still more intricate by using |Tarpeia~ to
signify the temple also, for |le~ and |macra~ (ll. 137, 138), 
which refer to the temple, agree with |Tarpeia.~  |come~, &c.:
`when the good Marcellus was removed from it, from which cause it
thereafter remained impoverished.'  |tolto~: `was removed from
the temple which he was defending.'  |per che~, &c.: cp. Lucan,
^loc. cit.~, ll. 167, 168, `Tristi spoliantur templa rapina, 
Pauperiorque fuit tunc primum Caesare Roma.' 

	|139.  mi rivolsi~: `I turned aside,' i.e. away from the
gate towards the sound within.  |primo tuono~: `the commencement
of a burst of sound,' i.e. the first words of the ^Te Deum.~ 
With this the spirits within were wont to celebrate the admission
of those newly arrived.  In like manner, when a soul is freed
from Purgatory the ^Gloria in excelsis~ is sung; cp. Purg. xx.
133-8, where it is noticeable, as illustrating |primo tuono~
here, that Dante is at first overpowered by the sound. 

	|141.  dolce suono~: this is the same as the ^tuono~; at 
first there is a deafening, though harmonious (|dolce~), burst of
sound; from this the words seem gradually to emerge. 

	|142-145.  Tale imagine appunto~: `just such an impression.'
The effect thus produced on the listener is compared to that of a
musical performance, in which the words are only intermittently
heard owing to the loudness of the accompaniment.  |organi~:
`musical instruments.'
