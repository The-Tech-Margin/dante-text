PREFATORY NOTE ON THE METHOD EMPLOYED BY DANTE IN DESCRIBING
PURGATORY PROPER.

	This is the most elaborately symmetrical part of the whole
poem, a corresponding mode of treatment being introduced in each
Cornice.  (These Cornices, seven in number, in which the seven
deadly sins are punished, rise one above another on the mountain
side, which they encircle, and every Cornice is presided over by
an angel.)  As Dante enters a Cornice, examples of the virtue
opposed to the vice which is punished there are presented to him
for admiration; and before he leaves the same Cornice examples of
the vice are presented to him for avoidance.  The two sets of
examples are presented either in the same or at least in a
similar manner; and the examples of the vice that are given, as a
rule, correspond in number to those of the virtue.  Usually,
also, the examples are drawn alternately from Scripture and from
classical sources; and the first example of the virtue is in
every case an incident in the life of the Blessed Virgin. 
Further, at one period of Dante's passage through a Cornice a
portion of one of the Offices of the Church is recited by the
spirits who are undergoing purgation there; and as he leaves the
Cornice he is sped on his way by the utterance of one of the
Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount, the voice which
pronounces it being in most cases -- probably in every case --
that of the presiding angel.  In the notes these points will be
mentioned for each Cornice at the place where that Cornice is
entered.  It should further be noticed that in Purgatory the most
heinous sins are found in the lower Cornices, and they decrease
in criminality as they ascend.  But the punishments are not
arranged in a fixed order of severity; thus in Purg. xix. 117 we
are told that no punishment is more severe than that of avarice,
which vice is expiated in the fifth Cornice. 

	|1-3.  Poi~: for ^Poich@e~, `after that.'  |Che~, &c.:
`which (gate) the perverted affection of men's souls, by making
them mistake wrong for right, causes to be disused'; i.e. few
souls reach Purgatory, the preparatory stage for heaven, because
they are led astray by the idea that the satisfaction of their
sinful desires is true happiness. 

	|4.  Sonando~: `by the sound,' i.e. not by the sight; the
two following lines are a comment on this. 

	|7-9.  salavam~: a Florentine dialectic form for ^salivam~;
cp. Purg. iv. 31.  |si moveva~: `undulated'; no real movement is
intended, but only the relative position of the rocks on either
hand as the passage wound through them.  Similarly in Inf. xviii.
17; xxiii 135 ^mover moversi~ are used of rocks starting forward
or projecting without the sense of motion.  |che fugge~, &c.:
`which now retires and now approaches.' 

	|11-12.  in acccstarsi~, &c.: `in keeping close, now in 
this direction, now in that, to the side of the rock which 
retires'; in other words, `in following the zigzags.' 

	|13-16.  E ci@o fece~, &c.; `and this caused our footsteps 
to be so infrequent.'  |lo scemo della luna~: `the moon's
decreasing disk.'  The moon was full on Maunday Thursday, April
7; it was now Easter Monday, April 11.  The time of day intended
is from 9 to 9.30 a.m.  |cruna~: `needle's eye,' `narrow
passage.' 

	|18.  indietro si rauna~: `shrinks inward' (Shadwell), lit.
`gathers itself backward,' so as to leave space for the Cornice. 
Some such meaning as those here given for ^raunare~ is required,
in order to connect it with that of `to assemble' in the
corresponding words ^ragunare, radunare.~ 

	|20.  un piano~: this is the first Cornice.  Here (1) the 
sin punished is pride; (2) the mode of punishment is being 
depressed by a heavy weight; (3) the examples of the opposite 
virtue are the Blessed Virgin, David and Trajan; (4) the examples
of the vice are Lucifer and Briareus; the Giants and Nimrod; 
Niobe and Saul; Arachne and Rehoboam; Eriphyle and Sennacherib; 
Cyrus and Holophernes; (5) the mode of presentation is by 
sculptured figures; (6) the passage of a Church Office recited is
the Lord's Prayer; (7) the Beatitude pronounced is ^Beati
pauperes spiritu.~ 

	|22-24.  confina il vano~: `borders on the void,' at the
edge of the precipice.  |ripa~: `the wall of rock,' on the inner
side.  |pur sale~: `rises sheer' (Shadwell), lit. `merely,' 
`absolutely.'  |Misurrebbe~: contracted for ^misurarebbe.~  |in 
tre volte~, &c.: lit. `a human body, estimated three times, would
measure.'  The width of the Cornice would thus be about 17 ft. 
For the mode of measurement cp. Inf. xxxi. 64, of the Frisians. 

	|25.  quanto~, &c.: only a portion of the Cornice was in 
view, because it ran round the mountain.  |trar d' ale~: `wing 
its flight.' 

	|28-30.  Lass@u~: upon the Cornice.  |Che, dritta, di~, &c.:
`which, being perpendicular, did not admit of being ascended.' 
If ^dritto~ is read (it has the greatest weight of MS.
authority), the meaning is, `which interdicted (lit. had 
lacking) the right of ascent.' 

	|32-33.  intagli~: `carvings'; these are instances of 
humility.  |Policreto~: the Greek sculptor Polycletus.  The 
interchange of ^l~ and ^r~ is a feature of the Tuscan dialect; 
see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~ pp. 525, 534.  Dante was acquainted with
the eminence of Polycletus as a sculptor through Aristotle, who
mentions him in several passages in his writings.  |li avrebbe
scorno~: `would be put to shame in its presence.' 

	|34-36.  L' angel~: Gabriel, the angel of the Annunciation. 
The first example of humility is the demeanour of the Virgin on
that occasion.  |lagrimata~: `longed for with tears.'  |Che~,
&c.: `which peace (i.e. reconciliation) opened to mankind heaven
which had so long been denied to them,' lit. `from its long
interdict.' 

	|41-42.  immaginata~: `imaged.'  |quella, Che ad aprir~, 
&c.: the Blessed Virgin, by whose instrumentality our redemption
was initiated. 

	|43-45.  in atto impressa~: `expressed in (lit. impressed
on) her mien.'  |propriamente~, &c.: `as clearly as the figure on
a seal is stamped on wax.' 

	|48.  Da quella parte~, &c.: they were advancing along the
Comice towards the right, which is their direction throughout 
Purgatory: at the present moment they were facing the mountain 
side with their backs to the precipice, Dante being on Virgil's 
left, and the next subject in relief was further on, i.e. beyond
where Virgil was standing; hence Dante in order to get a nearer
view passes Virgil (|varcai~, l. 53).  |onde~: `on which (side).'

	|49-51.  mi mossi col viso~: `I turned my eyes'; for the 
form of expression cp. Purg. xxxi. 100, `nelle braccia aprissi.'
|Diretro~: `behind,' from the point of view of one advancing 
along the Cornice; and so, `on the further side of.'  |da quella 
costa~, &c.: `on that side of me on which my conductor was
standing.' 

	|54.  Acciocch@e~, &c.: `that I might see it (^la storia~)
from a good point of view.' 

	|55-57.~  The second example is David dancing before the 
ark.  |marmo stesso~: `the very marble.'  |si teme~, &c.: the 
reference is to the death of Uzzah (2 Sam. vi. 7), in consequence
of which David left the ark three months at the house of Obed- 
edom; at the expiration of that time he removed it to Jerusalem 
and danced before it, as here described.  Dante has in one point
slightly confused the two occasions, for it was on the former 
that it was drawn by oxen, as he describes it in l. 56; when 
David danced before it, it was carried by Levites; 2 Sam. vi. 13;
cp. 1 Chron. xv. 26. 

	|59-60.  sette cori~: this is from the Vulgate of 2 Sam. vi.
12, `erant cum David septem chori'; the words are not found in
the Engl. version.  |a' due~, &c.: the two senses are those of
hearing and sight; `the bands of singers were so naturally 
represented as chanting, that while my ears told me they were not
doing so, my eyes assured me that they were.'  As regards the 
syntax, |l' un~ and |l' altro~ are in partitive apposition to 
|sensi~; `they caused the one of my two senses to say "they are 
not singing," the other "they are."' 

	|61-63.  al fummo~, &c.: `at the smoke of the incense (i.e:
as regards its reality) the eyes and nose contradicted one
another.' 

	|64-66.  vaso~: the Ark.  ^Vaso~ is used by Dante of any 
receptacle or depository, e.g. of the triumphal car in Purg. 
xxxiii. 34.  |Trescando~: `bounding in the dance'; 2 Sam vi. 16,
`leaping and dancing before the Lord.'  ^Trescare~ signifies 
dancing wildly.  |Alzato~: `high-girt'; the ^Vocab. Tramater~
quotes from Fra Giordano, of the Israelites at the Paschal feast,
`stando alzati,' i.e. with their loins girt.  |pi@u e men~, &c.:
`more than king,' because he was performing a priestly function
(he was wearing the ephod, 2 Sam.  vi. 14); `less than king,'
because he seemed to be debasing himself, as David himself says,
`I will be base in mine own sight,' ib. v. 22. 

	|67.  vista~: `window,' lit. `point of view'; `Michal,
Saul's daughter, looked through a window,' ib. v. 16. 

	|72.  mi biancheggiava~: `beamed white upon me.' 

	|73-75.~  The third example is that of the emperor Trajan 
and the widow woman.  |l' alta gloria~, &c.: `the noble deed of 
renown of the Roman emperor'; |principato~ for ^principe~, 
abstract for concrete.  Dante probably derived the story, which 
was widely spread in the middle ages, from the ^Fiore di 
Filosofi~, a work which has been wrongly attributed to Brunetto 
Latini.  |valore~: `worth.' |vittoria~: `triumph'; Pope Gregory 
the Great was believed to have rescued the soul of Trajan from 
Hell.  In Par. xx. 44, 45, he is found in Heaven among the just 
rulers. 

	|78.  Di lagrime~, &c.: `in attitude of weeping.' 

	|79-81.  Intorno~, &c.: `the space around him appeared 
thronged.'  For the absence of a proper subject to |parea~ cp. 
Purg. ix. 54.  |calcato~: see note on Purg. ii. 72.  |l' aquile~,
&c.: `the eagles on their golden ground seemed (|in vista~) to be
waving in the wind over his head.'  The eagles, which are here 
described as worked on banners, are a mediaeval adaptation of the
Roman military eagles. 

	|87.  s' affretta~: `shows impatience.' 

	|88-90.  Chi fia dov' io~: `he that takes my place'; my 
successor.  |L' altrui~, &c.: `what will another's good deeds 
avail (to exculpate) thee, if thou dost neglect thine own.' 

	|92.  mova~: `start on my expedition.' 

	|94-96.  Colui~, &c.: God, in the depth of whose counsels 
everything, whether created or uncreated, exists.  |visibile 
parlare~: `visible converse,' i.e. language which appeals to 
the eye, not to the ear.  |qui~: on earth. 

	|99.  per lo fabbro~, &c.: `precious to behold for the 
sake of God their artificer.' 

	|100-102.  Ecco~: there are now seen approaching along the
Cornice a band of spirits, who are expiating the sin of pride 
by bearing heavy weights, by the burden of which they are
depressed.  |di qua~: i.e. on the left side, as is shown by l. 
105, where Dante, who is on Virgil's right (see note on l. 48), 
turns towards him in order to see them.  |ne invieranno~, &c.: 
`will direct us to the upper Cornices.' 

	|103-105.  a mirar~: `on examining the sculptures.'  The 
clauses which follow run thus -- |non furon lenti, volgendosi ver
lui per veder~, &c. 

	|106-108.  per@o~: i.e. notwithstanding what I am about to
tell you.  |ti smaghi~, &c.: `fail of good resolution' to repent. 
^Smagare~ is Span. ^desmayar~, Engl. `dismay.'  Skeat s.v.
`Dismay') says it is from O. H. G. ^magan~ (Mod. Germ. ^m,ogen~),
`to be able,' `to have power': thus ^smagarsi~ is literally `to
be deprived of strength.'  |il debito~: the expiation of sin: 

	|109-110.  la forma~: `the nature,' i.e. the terrible
character.  |la succession~: the glory which is to follow.  |a 
peggio~: `at worst.' 

	|113-114.  sembran~: for a similar attraction of number cp.
Inf. viii. 78.  |vaneggio~: `am confused'; cp. Purg. xviii. 143. 

	|116-117.  li rannicchia~: `makes them crouch.'  |i miei 
occhi~, &c.: `my eyes too at first had a hard struggle to 
distinguish them.' 

	|118-120.  disviticchia~: `disentangle,' i.e. make out
clearly: ^Viticchio~ is the tendril of a vine or creeping plant;
hence ^avviticchiarsi~ is used of such growths twining themselves
round a thing) and ^disviticchiare~ of clearing away these
growths.  |si picchia~: `beats his breast'; cp. Inf. xviii. 105.
This action as well as the attitude of the spirits, corresponds 
to the description of the humility of the Publican in the
parable, who `would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven,
but smote upon his breast'; Luke xviii. 13. 

	|123.  ritrosi~: `backsliding.'  The proud, while they
persuade themselves that they are advancing towards the
forefront, are really falling into the rear. 

	|124-126.  vermi~: here used for caterpillars.  The argument
against men being proud in this life is, that here they are
imperfect creatures (cp. ll. 128, 129), the only object of whose
existence is the development of the immortal soul, which is
destined to appear unveiled before its just Judge.  |farfalla~: 
the symbolism here implied in the comparison of the soul to a 
butterfly is so natural, that %psi%upsilon%chi%eta\ seems to have
been the only word for a butterfly in Greek. 

	|127-129.  in alto galla~: `exalts itself'; ^gallare~ is 
properly used of floating on the surface, as in Inf. xxi. 57. 
|Poi~: for ^Poich@e~, `since.'  |entomata in difetto~: `imperfect
insects.'  The word |entoma~, from which |entomata~ comes, is the
Greek %epsilon%nu%pio%mu%alpha\ (sc. %zeta%omega%alpha\), which
is common in Aristotle for `insects.'  In Low Lat., however, it 
seems to have been regarded as neut. sing., for in the example 
given by Ducange `nullum entoma' is found.  It was natural that 
from this a plur. ^entomata~ should be formed on the analogy of 
^po,ema po,emata, dogma dogmata~, &c.  |in cui~, &c.: `which is 
undeveloped.' 

	|131.  Per mensola~: `to serve as a corbel'; such brackets
are frequently used to support the roofs of mediaeval churches. 

	|133-134.  La qual~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `the pain 
expressed in which, though imaginary, causes real distress to 
arise in the mind of him who sees it.' 

	|138-139.  E qual~, &c.: `the most patient in his mien 
seemed in his lamentation to say, "I can endure it no longer."'
