	|1-3.  |Deus~, &c.: Ps. lxxix. 1, `O God, the heathen are
come into thine inheritance'; this is here applied to the havoc
wrought in the Church by hostile powers, such as the French
monarchs.  |Le donne~: the three theological and the four 
cardinal virtues, singing the psalm antiphonally (|alternando~). 

	|4-6.  pia~: `compassionate.'  |si fatta~: `in aspect 
such.'  |si cambi@o~: `changed countenance.' 

	|9.  colorata~, &c.: i.e. blushing with indignation and 
zeal. 

	|10-12.  Modicum~, &c.: the words are our Lord's, John xvi.
16.  The reference in |non videbitis me~ is to the removal of the
Papal See to Aiignon, which from the point of view of that time
was a subversal of two Church principles; and that in |vos 
videbitis me~ is to the subsequent restoration of the Papal See 
to Rome, accompanied by a moral reformation in the Church. 
Beatrice, who represents true doctrine in general, is here
regarded as signifying the right view of God's government in the
Church, which would be temporarily obscured and afterwards 
reaffirmed.  The ten-syllable lines here and in ll. 8 and 12 are 
justified by the rhyming words in two of them being in Latin; the
same metrical peculiarity is found in Purg. xxiii. 74 and Par.
vii. 1, where the rhyming words, or one of them, are in Hebrew. 

	|15.  il Savio~, &c.: Statius, who remained when Virgil 
departed.

	|21.  ben disposto~: `in a favourable position.' 

	|22-24.  Si comee~, &c.: `as soon as I was by her side, as 
was my duty' -- from obedience to her commands.  |perch@e non~, 
&c.; `why dost thou not venture to ask me for explanations?' 

	|34-36.  il vaso~: the car, i.e. the Church is meant; cp.
Purg. xxxii. 131, 132.  ^Vaso~ is similarly used of the Ark in
Purg. x. 64; its primary meaning in this metaphorical sense is
that of `receptacle.'  |Fu, e non @e~: from Rev. xvii. 8.  The 
meaning is, that in the eyes of God the Papacy, which represents
the Church, ceased to exist when its seat was transferred to 
Avignon.  |ma chi~, &c.: `but let him who is responsible for the
deed (Philip the Fair, who was the chief agent in bringing about
this change) lay this to heart, that the vengeance of God fears 
not (is not liable to be hindered by) any sop.'  The reference in
|suppe~ is to a certain limitation which existed to the practice
of the ^vendetta~, viz. that if the murderer could eat a sop of 
bread and wine at the grave of his victim within nine days from 
the time of death, he was free from the vengeance of the family.
The relations of the murdered man kept watch to prevent this. 
Beatrice's meaning then is -- there are no limitations to hinder
the execution of divine vengeance. 

	|37-39.  Non sar@a~, &c.: `the eagle (the Imperial line) 
which left its feathers on the car (cp. Purg. xxxii. 125, 126) 
will not be for ever without an heir.'  According to Dante there
had been no real Emperor since Frederic II (see ^Conv.~ iv. 3. 
ll. 38-43), because his successors had neglected the affairs of 
Italy, which Dante regarded as the most important function of the
Emperor, as he says in his appeal to the emperor Albert in Purg.
vi. 97-105.  |Per che~, &c.: `owing to which (the dotations) it 
became first a prodigy (Purg. xxxii. 136 foll.) and afterwards a
prey (^ibid.~ l. 158).' 

	|40-41.  io veggio~, &c.: `I see stars (stellar influences
by which the fortunes of men are regulated) even now drawing
nigh, to assign us the time, at which (^Nel quale~, l. 43).' 

	|43.  un cinquecento diece e cinque~: the idea of describing
a person by a number is derived from the number of the Beast in
Rev. xiii. 18.  The great majority of expositors regard the
number here, which in Roman letters is DXV, as equivalent to DUX
by transposition of the last two letters.  If we accept this
view, we can hardly interpret its significance apart from that of
the ^Veltro~ in Inf. i. 101.  It seems probable that in both
cases a `coming man' is intended, to whom Dante looked forward as
the regenerator of Italy, and the restorer of the Church and the
Papacy to their rightful position.  In the Inferno the person who
is darkly hinted at as destined to fulfil this office is Can
Grande della Scala, while here men's hopes are turned towards a 
member of the Imperial line, who is soon to arise (ll. 37, 38). 
His primary function is to exact vengeance for the iniquitous 
alliance between the Papacy and the court of France (^ancider@a~,
&c., ll. 44, 45).  According to another explanation, which has 
been proposed by Dr. Moore in a pamphlet entitled `The "DXV" 
Prophecy in the Divina Commedia' (printed for private
circulation), the person here intended is definitely the emperor
Henry VII.  This conclusion he deduces primarily from a careful 
consideration of the language of the context preceding; but he 
also thinks that the same result may be obtained by estimating 
thie numerical values assigned to the letters which form his name
in the Hebrew alphabet.  He has proved that there is a very large
amount of mediaeval Kabbalistic literature, in which this method
of interpretation by the numerical value assigned to the Hebrew 
letters is practised; and also, that some of the writers of this
class, and certainly the mystical system of interpretation itself
can hardly fail to have been well known to Dante.  Now the name 
^Arrico~ -- which is a legitimate form of the name of Henry of 
Luxemburg -- when the numerical value of the letters which
compose it is estimated according to the Hebrew computation, is 
equivalent to 511 (^a~ = 1, ^r~ = 200, ^r~ = 200, ^i~ = 10, ^c~ =
100), without taking into account the value of the final letter 
^o.~  This vowel does not appear (like the rest) to have had, at
least in mediaeval times, any definitely recognized equivalent in
the Hebrew alphabet, and therefore its numerical value requires 
to be assigned on independent lines; this, according to Dr.
Moore, might probably have been taken by Dante as 4, inasmuch as
it is the fourth vowel.  Thus the total becomes 515, the number 
which Dante gives. 

	|45.  fuia~: `robber'; see note on Inf. xii. 90. 

	|46-48.  forse che~, &c.: `maybe that my dark utterance 
persuades thee less'; for the use of |forse che~ cp. Purg. iv.
98; xxi. 121.  |Qual Temi~, &c.: `like (that of) Themis and the 
Sphinx.'  The riddles of the Sphinx are well known.  The
enigmatical response of Themis, which is here referred to, is 
that which she gave to Deucalion and Pyrrha after the Flood, Ov.
^Met.~ i. 379-89.  |attuia~: `obscures'; the etymology of the 
word is doubtful; some connect it with Lat. ^obturare~, `to close
up.' 

	|49-51.  Ma tosto~, &c.: `but soon events will be the 
interpreters'; coming events will furnish the explanation.  The 
history of the meaning here attached to |Naiade~ is a curious
one.  Though it is now known from MSS. discovered since Dante's 
time that Ovid in the passage here referred to (^Met.~ vii. 759,
760) wrote `Carmina Laiades non intellecta priorum Solverat
ingeniis' -- where `Laiades' means Oedipus, who solved the riddle
of the Sphinx -- yet all the MSS. of Ovid that were known in the
middle ages read `Naiades...solvunt'; hence Dante, following his
text of Ovid, regarded the Naiads as the interpreters of enigmas.

|Senza~, &c.: `without (as in the case of Thebes) its causing
ruin to the flocks'; cp. Ovid, l. 764, `exitio pecorum.' 

	|52-54.  porte~: `uttered'; cp. Purg. xxx. 141.  |Del
viver~, &c.: take with |ai vivi~; `the living (I mean) who live 
that life which is a race towards death.'  The real life is the 
eternal life which Beatrice herself enjoys. 

	|56-57.  qual hai~, &c.: `in what condition thou hast seen
the tree.'  |due volte~: very different views exist as to the 
two occasions which are here referred to; but the special mention
of Adam's sin in l. 61 seems to point to that as one of them; and
Beatrice's intention that a lesson should be drawn by Dante's 
readers (l. 55) suggests that the separation of the car from the
tree (i.e. of the Church from the Empire), which was effected 
by the giant (Purg. xxxii. 158), is the other. 

	|59.  bestemmia di fatto~: sacrilege. 

	|62-63.  Cinquemili' anni e pi@u~: in Par. xxvi. 118-23 Adam
is made to say that he spent 930 years on earth and 4,302 in
Limbo, i.e. 5,232 years in all.  |Colui~: Christ, who paid in His
own person the penalty for Adam's sin in eating of the apple.  

	|65-66.  Per singular~, &c.: i.e. that the grandeur and
inviolability of the Empire is ordained by Providence.
|travolta~: `inverted,' because it widened as it ascended, so 
that its branches might be out of reach of the hands of spoilers;
cp. Purg. xxxii. 40, 41. 

	|67-69.  E se~, &c.: `and, had not your mind been hardened
by worldly thoughts, and stained by the pleasure derived from 
them.'  |Elsa~: a tributary of the Arno with petrifying powers. 
|Piramo~: the death of Pyramus was the cause of the mulberry 
changing from white to a dark colour; cp. Purg. xxvii. 39. 

	|70-72.  Per tante~, &c.: `by all these incidents (of the 
vision) without further aid thou wouldst recognize the justice of
God in the prohibition not to touch the tree, in its moral 
interpretation.'  In other words -- the moral of the symbolical 
occurrences which you have seen is, that no one should put forth
his hand to attack the Empire, just as our First Parents were 
forbidden to pluck the fmit of the Tree of Knowledge. 
|moralmente~: Dante explains in ^Conv.~ ii. 1. ll. 42-51, that 
the moral, as distinguished from the literal and the allegorical
sense of a statement, is that in which it is regarded in its 
application to life and practice. 

	|74.  ed, impietrato, tinto~: `and, in addition to being 
hardened, stained.' 

	|76-78.  se non~, &c.: `if not in words, at least in 
outline.'  |per quello~, &c.: `for the same reason, for which a 
pilgrim (`palmer') carries his staff girt with palm-leaves,' viz.
as a memorial token -- in Dante's case, as a remembrance of his 
visit to the Terrestrial Paradise. 

	|84.  s' aiuta~: `it applies itself to understand it'; cp.
Purg. xii. 130. 

	|85-87.  Perch@e~, &c.: `in order that you may estimate the
worth of that school which you have followed, and may see how
little its teaching is capable of following in the wake of my 
discourse.'  By the `school' are meant the disciples of human 
philosophy, which study Dante had cultivated to the disregard of
theology. 

	|88-90.  vostra~: the plural here signifies `of you and 
your school.'  |si discorda~: `is separated'; cp. Is. lv. 9, `as 
the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
your ways.'  |pi@u alto festina~: the highest or outermost of the
moving spheres, which consequently revolves the most rapidly, is
the ^Primum Mobile~; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 19-21. 

	|91.  mi ricorda~: for this impersonal use see note to Inf.
ix. 98, `se ben vi ricorda.' 

	|92.  voi~: this is the plural of dignity.  The other
personages in the poem whom Dante addresses in this manner are 
Farinata (Inf. x. 51), Cavalcante (Inf. x. 63), Brunetto Latini 
(Inf. xv. 30), Adrian V (Purg. xix. 131), Guido Guinicelli (Purg.
xxvi. 112), and Cacciaguida (Par. xvi. 10). 

	|96.  ancoi~: `but now,' for ^anche oggi.~ 

	|97-99.  se dal fummo~, &c.: `just as, when we see smoke, 
we infer the presence of fire, so your having turned your 
thoughts to another than me (|tua voglia altrove attenta~) is 
shown to have been culpable by your having forgotten it in the 
water of Lethe,' for it is only of sins that Lethe causes 
forgetfulness. 

	|100-122.  oramai~, &c.: `henceforward what I say will be 
clear, so far as it will be suitable to reveal it to your 
unpractised view.' 

	|103-105.  E pi@u~, &c.: the time is now midday of the 
fourth day on the Mountain of Purgatory.  At noon the sun is 
brightest (|pi@u corrusco~), and the imagination naturally 
conceives that it pauses or slackens its speed (|con pi@u lenti 
passi~) when it reaches the highest point of its course: thus 
Shelley in his ^Hymn of Apolto~ makes the Sun to say, `I stand at
noon upon the peak of heaven,' and Sophocles says (^Ant.~ 415,
416), %epsilon%nu\ %alpha%iota%theta%epsilon%rho%iota\ 
%mu%epsilon%sigma%omega\ %kappa%alpha%tau%epsilon%sigma%tau%eta\ 
%lambda%alpha%eta%pi%rho%o%varsigma\ %eta%lambda%iota%o%upsilon\ 
%kappa%upsilon%kappa%lambda%o%varsigma\.  Dante repeats the idea
in Par. xxiii. 11, 12, where he describes the meridian as `la 
plaga, Sotto la quale il sol mostra men fretta.'  |Che~, &c.: 
`which, with the point of view, shifts here and there' (Longf.);
i.e. the meridian circle, which is crossed by the sun at midday,
varies at each place according to its longitude. 

	|108.  novitate a sue vestigge~: `some strange object in his
track.' 

	|109-111.  al fin~, &c.: i.e. where the shadow of the forest
came to an end.  The reason why the darkness of the forest is
noticed especially at this point is the contrast with the light
into which they emerge.  |Sopra~, &c.: `above their cold brooks
the Alps wear'; |Alpe~, in whatever sense it is used, is always
sing. in the ^Div. Com.~; cp. Purg. xvii. 1. 

	|112.  Eufrates e Tigri~: Dante could hardly have failed 
here to be thinking of the description in Gen. ii. 10, 14 of the
common source of the four rivers of Paradise, of which the Tigris
(Hiddekel) and the Euphrates were two.  But the idea of a common
source for these two rivers independently of the other two he 
derived from the classics.  It is mentioned by three authors with
whom Dante was familiar.  Thus Lucan says (^Phars.~ iii. 256-9),
`Quaque caput rapido tollit cum Tigride magnus Euphrates, quos 
non diversis fontibus edit Persis, et incertum, tellus si misceat
amnes, quod potius sit nomen aquis.'  Bo,ethius (^De Cons.~ v. 
Metr. 1) writes `Tigris et Euphrates uno se fonte resolvunt, et 
mox abiunctis dissociantur aquis.'  Isidore (^Orig.~ xiii. 21. 
10) quotes Sallust to the same effect: `Sallustius, auctor
certissimus, ita asseri; Tigrim et Euphratem uno fonte manare in
Armenia.'  For a possible explanation of the origin of the fable
see H. F. Tozer's ^History of Ancient Geography~, pp. 270-2. 

	|113-114.  Veder mi parve~: `methought I saw'; he saw what
resembled the descriptions of the two rivers.  |E quasi amici~,
&c: `and lingeringly part, like friends, from one another.' 

	|116-117.  Che acqua~, &c.: `what stream is this, which 
here diffuses itself from a single source, and withdraws one 
portion of its waters from the other?' 

	|119.  Matelda~: Beatrice commissions Matelda to answer this
question, because this is her suitable function as being a
regular occupant of the Terrestrial Paradise.  N.B. This is the 
only place in which the name of Matelda is given. 

	|121.  Questo~: the source of the two rivers was described
by Matelda in Purg. xxviii. 121 foll. 

	|124-126.  maggior cura~: the sights which had been 
presented to him in the Terrestrial Paradise.  |priva~: `takes 
away.'  |negli occhi oscura~: `dull of vision.' 

	|127-129.  vedi Euno@e~: the non-elision of the vowel before
|Euno@e~, and the similar use before ^Eufrates~ in l. 112, seem
to show that Dante admitted ^hiatus~ before the diphthong ^eu.~ 
|usa~: for ^usata~; cp. Purg. xii. 85. `As thou art wont' seems
to imply that this was Matelda's office in behalf of all the
souls that had passed through Purgatory. 

	|132.  per segno~: `by some intimation.' 

	|133.  preso~: `taken by the hand.' 

	|137-138.  pur~, &c.: `I would sing at least in part.'  |Lo
dolce ber~: the water of Euno,e restores the recollection of
every good deed; cp. Purg. xxviii. 127-32. 

	|139-140.  piene~, &c.: we have here a strong evidence of
the symmetry of the plan of the poem.  The total number of verses
in the ^Div. Com.~ is 14,233, and of these 4,720 are in the Inf.,
4,755 in the Purg., and 4,758 in the Par., so that the number
assigned to each part is approximately equal.  See Mariotti,
^Dante e la Statistica~, p. 25.  |Ordite~: `planned,' lit.
`warped'; the proper meaning of the verb ^ordire~ is `to begin a
web.' 

	|143-145.  piante novelle~, &c.: `young trees renewed with 
fresh foliage.'  For the fanciful repetition in |novelle~,
|Rinnovellate~, |novella~ cp. Inf. xxx. 136, 137, and the note on
Inf. xiii. 25.  |stelle~: see note on Par. xxxiii. 145.
