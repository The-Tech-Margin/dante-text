	|1.  lui~: the conversation. 

	|4-6.  rimorte~: `twice dead'; this word, which seems not to
be found elsewhere, may have been suggested to Dante by
`arbores...bis mortuae' in Jude 12.  |Traean~: `expressed,' lit. 
`drew forth.' 

	|8-9.  Ella~: the spirit (^anima~) of Statius, of whom Dante
was speaking at the end of the previous Canto.  |altrui~:
primarily Dante is meant, on account of his burden of human 
flesh; but also Virgil, because Statius desired to enjoy his 
conversation; cp. Purg. xxii. 96-9. 

	|10-11.  Piccarda~: sister of Forese and Corso Donati, who
was a nun of Santa Clara, and is placed by Dante in the first 
sphere of Paradise -- the ^alto Olimpo~ of l. 15; see Par. iii. 
46-9.  |da notar~: `worthy of note.' 

	|16-18.  non si vieta~: `there is nothing to prevent,' i.e. 
no offence can be taken; cp. ll. 26, 27.  |munta via~: `effaced,'
lit. `milked out'; cp. the use of ^munta~ in Inf. xxiv. 43.  In
this Cornice fasting had rendered the spirits unrecognizable. 

	|19.  Bonagiunta~: a minor poet, of whom Dante speaks
unfavourably in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 13. l. 8 as composing verses
in the dialect of Lucca.  He is said to have been a ^bon vivant.~

	|20-24.  quella faccia~: this is Pope Martin IV, who had 
previously been Canon of Tours (Torso, l. 23); he used to have 
the eels from the lake of Bolsena cooked in wine for his table, 
and is reported to have died in consequence of a surfeit of them.
|trapunta~: for ^trapuntata~, from ^trapuntare~, `to work 
embroidery'; here it means `rough and punctured,' from the 
resemblance of the perished skin in these respects to the surface
of a piece of embroidery.  |Ebbe~, &c.: as Pope he was Spouse 
of the Church.  |vernaccia~: a red wine, which was known in Engl.
as `vernage.' 

	|27.  per@o~: `thereat.'  |atto bruno~: `dark look.' 

	|29.  Ubaldin~: he was father of Abbe Roger, the murderer 
of Count Ugolino, Inf. xxxiii. 14.  |Bonifazio~: Abp. of Ravenna
from 1274-94; he was of the family of the Fieschi of Genoa, and 
nephew of Pope Innocent IV. 

	|30.  Che pastur@o~, &c.: `who shepherded a large flock with
his rook.'  |Rocco~ is the name of the castle or `rook' at chess,
and Lana, who takes the word in that sense, says in explanation
that the pastoral staff of the archbishops of Ravenna was not
curved like those of other archbishops, but was shaped in its
upper part like the `rook' at chess.  This, if true, would
determine the meaning of the passage; but there is no further 
evidence to support Lana's statement, nor is it confirmed by 
anything that is found on the monuments of archbishops at 
Ravenna, or by any traditions now existing there.  The natural 
inference therefore is, that this was an ^ex post facto~ 
explanation on that commentator's part.  Recently, however, a 
pastoral staff of mediaeval workmanship, with a headpiece of the
shape of a castle at chess, has come to light, which was 
preserved in the Camaldolese monastery of Classe, and now exists
in the public library of Ravenna. (See Toynbee's ^Dict.~, s.v.
`Ravenna.') The resemblance between so unusual an object as this
and that which Dante appears to be here describing is a thing so
remarkable that it is not easy to ascribe it to chance; and it 
has been suggested -- since Lana's statement about the
archbishops of Ravenna generally, as we have seen, is unconfirmed
-- that this is the original staff to which Dante is referring, 
and that it was a special possession of Bonifazio, and is here 
mentioned in connexion with him on account of its peculiarity of
form.  This is quite possible; but as the origin and history of 
the existing staff are unknown, it is difficult to determine the
question satisfactorily.  |molte genti~: this refers to the great
extent of the diocese, which included the whole of the Romagna, 
and part of the Emilia. 

	|31-33.  Marchese~: one of a noble family at Forl@i.  Little
is known of him, except his answer to those who said he was
always drinking, `Why do they not say that I am always thirsty?'
|ch' ebbe spazio~, &c.: `who of yore had leisure at Forl@i for
drinking with less thirst than he feels here in Purgatory, and
even so was such a toper that he never felt satisfied.' 

	|34-36.  come fa~, &c.: `as he does, who scans a number of 
men, and after doing so rates one more highly than another, so 
did I to Bonagiunta of Lucca, who seemed more than the others to
desire information concerning me.'  |s' apprezza~: ^fa prezza~ is
also read, with the same meaning.  |fe' io a~: the final vowel of
^fei~ and both vowels of ^io~ are lost in scansion; cp. Purg. iv.
132.  |voler contezza: cp. l.~ 49; ^aver contezza~, `to be 
acquainted with,' is also read. 

	|37-39.  non so che~, &c.: `I was conscious of a sound like
Gentucca there where he was conscious of the wound ofjustice
which macerates them so.'  |mormorava~ and |non so che~ imply
that Bonagiunta spoke indistinctly from his lips being parched
with hunger and tbirst.  |Gentucca~: this is generally regarded
as the name of a lady of Lucca, to whom Dante became attached,
though not necessarily otherwise than in an honourable way -- the
^femmina~ of l. 43.  |l@a ove~, &c.: in his mouth, where he felt
the craving for food.  |pilucca~: this word is derived from Lat.
^pilare~, `to pull off the hair,' `denude'; Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 
247.  In Italian it is first used of stripping off grapes; here 
it refers to the wasted flesh, like ^sfoglia~ in Purg. xxiii. 58. 

	|43-45.  non porta~, &c.: i.e. `is still unmarried'; the
veil (|benda~) was the headdress of married women and widows. 
|come che~, &c.: `however men may blame it'; this refers to an 
evil name which was popularly attached to Lucca, rather than to 
Dante's own vituperation in Inf. xxi. 41, 42. 

	|48.  Dichiareranti~, &c.: `the facts (|le cose vere~) will
make the matter clear to thee.' 

	|49-51.  che fuore~, &c.: `who evoked (i.e. brought into
prominence) the verses in the new style,' the ^dolce stil nuovo~
of l. 57.  |Donne, &c.~: this is the first line in the first
Canzone in Dante's ^Vita Nuova.~ 

	|52-54.  Io mi son, &c.~: `I am one who, when Love inspires
me, attend, and express in words the thoughts which he suggests
to the mind,' lit. `express his meaning in words, in the same way
as he dictates it in the form of thoughts (|dentro).'  |mi
spira~: cp. ^spirarmi~, Par. vi. 23.  |vo~: ^andare~ with the
gerund is here almost redundant; cp. the use of ^venire~ in Purg.
xxii. 82. 

	|55-57.  issa~: `now'; see note on Inf. xxiii. 7.  For the
^hiatus~ before |issa~, modified by the stop, cp. Purg. xxix.
135.  `Now I perceive the impediment (lit. knot, restraint),
which prevented the Notary and Guittone and me from adopting
(lit. detained us on the hither side of) the sweet new style.' 
The impediment was their not understanding the principle on which
the `new style' was based, viz. that the words should be inspired
directly by the thoughts and feelings, and should correspond to 
them.  This is what is set forth by Dante in ll. 52-4, and is 
expressed in other words by Bonagiunta in ll. 58, 59.  The 
schools of poetry which preceded the `new style' were (1) the 
Sicilian school, under Proven$cal influence, to which the Notary
(Jacopo da Lentini, in the first half of Cent. xiii) belonged; 
and (2) the ^scuola dottrinale~, which theorized and
philosophized on love, to which Guittone d' Arezzo (second half 
of Cent.  xiii) and Bonagiunta belonged.  The writers of the new
school, to which Dante belonged, were distinguished from these by
being natural, while they were conventional. 

	|58-59.  le vostre penne~, &c.: `your pens follow closely
the inspiration of Love (|il dittator~, him who dictates).' 

	|61-62.  E qual~, &c.: `and he who sets himself to look 
more closely into the matter finds no further distinction than 
this between the two styles'; i.e. this is the essential point 
of difference.  For the force of the prepositions in l. 62, and 
the explanation of the idiom, cp. Inf. xix. 113, `E che altro @e
da voi all' idolatre,' `what difference is there between,' &c. 

	|64.  gli augei~: the cranes.  The flight of these birds 
has already furnished Dante with a simile in Inf. v. 46, 47, and
probably they are also meant in Par. xviii. 73-5. 

	|72.  Fin che~, &c.: `until his heavy breathing is
assuaged,' lit. `exhaled.' |l' affollar~: `the panting,' lit. 
`pressure,' from ^folla~, `crowd,' `press.' 

	|75.  riveggia~: i.e. here in Purgatory. 

	|80-81.  si spolpa~: `is depleted.' |disposto~: `ordained,'
`doomed'; cp. Par. viii. 104. 

	|82-84.  quei~: Corso Donati.  Forese's brother, leader of 
the Black Guelfs.  According to Villani (viii. 96) he met his 
death at the hands of certain Catalans, after he had thrown 
himself from his horse to escape from being given up to the 
citizens.  Dante's account of the occurrence is different, and 
possibly various versions of it existed; but it looks as if the 
Poet had given it a colouring of his own, so as to make it appear
miraculous.  |la valle, &c.~: the abyss of the Inferno, `where 
there is never forgiveness.' 

	|86-87.  Crescendo~: `increasing in speed.'  |vilmente
disfatto~: `hideously mutilated.' 

	|88.  molto~: the time was eight years, for the date of 
Corso Donati's death was Oct. 6, 1308. 

	|91.  ti rimani~: in other words, `I must leave thee.' 

	|95-97.  che cavalchi~: `which is riding to meet the enemy.' 
|del primo intoppo~: `of being the first to engage the foe.' 
|valchi~: `steps,' an archaic word. 

	|98-99.  con esso i due~: `with those two only'; for the use
of |esso~ with |con~ cp. Inf. xxxii. 62; Purg. iv. 27.
|maliscalchi~: `leaders,' lit. `marshals'; Virgil and Statius are
meant.

	|100-102.  entrato~: ^entrare innanzi~ is used for `to pass
on in front'; cp. Purg. iii. 101.  `And when he had passed on in
front of us so far, that my eyes went in pursuit of his person,
as my mind did of his words'; i.e. I was straining my eyes to
keep him in view, as my mind was straining after the meaning of
what he had said. 

	|105.  Per esser~, &c.: `because I had only just then turned
(round the curve of the Cornice) in that direction.'  |l@aci~:
cp. ^lici~, Purg. vii. 64. 

	|110-111.  per fare~, &c.: `in order to render their longing
exceedingly keen, he (|il pregato~) holds on high the object of
their desire.' 

	|116.  Legno~: the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, which
grows in the Terrestrial Paradise on the summit of the Mountain
(|pi@u su~); cp. Purg. xxxii. 38. 

	|119-120.  ristretti~, &c.: `drawing close together, we
passed onward on the side which rises,' i.e. on the side towards
the Mountain.  They passed between the tree and the flank of the
Mountain, and the narrowness of the space forced them to draw
close together. 

	|121-123.  dicea~: in like manner as the voice in the former
tree had recited the examples of temperance (Purg. xxii. 142
foll.), so the voice in this tree proclaims the examples of
gluttony.  These are (1) the Centaurs; (2) the companions of 
Gideon -- one from the classics, the other from Scripture. 
|maledetti~: the Centaurs, who were born of Ixion and the Cloud 
(|Nei nuvoli formati~), and whose two natures, of man and horse, 
were joined at the breast (|doppi petti~).  When they were 
drunk with wine |(satolli~) at the marriage feast of Hippodamia 
and Pirithous, they strove to carry off the bride and the other 
women, but were resisted and overcome by Theseus and the 
Lapithae.  The story is told in Ovid, ^Met.~ xii. 210 foll., 
which was Dante's authority, as we see from the epithet 
^nubigena~, (l. 211), and the expression ^duo pectora~ (l. 377). 

	|124-126.  molli~: `weak,' i.e. unrestrained.  These were 
the people in Gideon's company who `bowed down on their knees to
drink water,' in contrast with the three hundred who `lapped, 
putting their hand to their mouth'; in consequence of which 
Gideon `sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but 
retained the three hundred men' (Judges vii. 6, 8).  |non v' 
ebbe~: read ^non n' ebbe~; `had none of them in his company.' 
|discese i colli~: `the camp of Midian was beneath him in the 
valley,' v. 8. 

	|127-129.  all' un~, &c.: `to one (the inner) of the two 
edges' of the Cornice; cp. l. 120.  |vivagni~: lit. `selvages'; 
cp. Inf. xiv. 

	|123.  udendo, &c.~: `listening to examples of the sin of 
gluttony which were followed erewhile by a disastrous
recompense'; `erewhile,' because they were stories of old days. 

	|130-132.  rallargati~: `once more at large' (Cary); this is
in contrast with ^ristretti~ of l. 119.  |sola~: from which the
spirits had departed.  |Contemplando ciascun~: `each of us rapt
in thought.' 

	|135.  poltre~: `sluggish'; cp. ^spoltrare~, `to get rid 
of sluggishness,' in Inf. xxiv. 46: our word `poltroon' is 
connected with this (Skeat). 

	|136.  fossi~: archaic form of 3 sing. imperf. subj., for 
^fosse~; cp. Inf. iv. 64, ^dicessi~; ix. 60, ^chiudessi.~ 

	|139-141.  un~: the Angel of the sixth Cornice.  |dar
volta~: to turn towards the entrance of the passage.  |per pace~:
to seek the repose of the Blessed. 

	|143-144.  mi volsi~, &c.: `I turned round and went behind
my instructors, like one who in walking guides himself by sounds'
(of words or footsteps). 

	|149-150.  la piuma~: the Angel's wing.  By the movement 
of this the sixth P is obliterated from Dante's forehead. 
|ambrosia~: i.e. heavenly dainties, in contrast to those which 
tempt human appetite.  |orezza~: `breath,' `fragrance'; der. from
Lat. ^aura~, see note on Inf. xvii. 87.  Dante appears here to 
have had in his mind Virg. ^Georg.~ iv. 415, `liquidum ambrosiae
diffundit odorem.' 

	|151-154.  Beati~: the Beatitude for this Cornice is
`Blessed are they that hunger for righteousness,' but it is
adapted here, so as to mean, `Blessed are they who hunger in 
accordance with right,' i.e. who observe the just mean in respect
of diet.  The part of this Beatitude which refers to thirst has
been already used in the fifth Cornice.  |non fuma~: `does not
excite'; the transitions of meaning through which this sense
^offumare~ is arrived at seem to be `smoke,' `exhale,' `excite.' 
|Esuriendo~: `hungering for'; take with |l' amor del gusto~: the
word is from the Lat. ^esurire~, which occurs in the Beatitude.
