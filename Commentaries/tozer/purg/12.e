	|1-3.  Di pari~: Dante was walking side by side with
Oderisi, and bowed down like him; cp. Purg. xi. 78.  |pedagogo~:
`preceptor'; probably this, and not `guide,' is the meaning.  The
source from which Dante got the word seems to have been Gal. 
iii. 24, where the Engl. Trans., `the law was our schoolmaster
^to bring us unto~ Christ,' would favour the latter
signification, but the Vulgate, which Dante used, gives `lex
paedagogus noster fuit ^in~ Christo,' which supports the former. 

	|4.  varca~: `proceed.' 

	|7-9.  Dritto~, &c.: `upright, as one is wont in walking.'
|vuolsi~: lit. `it is natural'; this meaning is derived from that
of `it is fitting,' Inf. xvi. 15.  |chinati~: `depressed,' by the
sense of humiliation which remained on the mind after seeing the
punishment of pride,; cp. Purg. xiii. 138.  |scemi~: `lowly.' 

	|12.  leggieri~: i.e. in contrast to the burdened souls 
whom they were leaving. 

	|15.  lo letto~: `the resting-place.'  The examples of 
pride and its punishment are so placed, that the spirits 
undergoing Purgatory tread them under their feet, and are also 
compelled to see them. 

	|17.  tombe terragne~: tombs beneath the pavement, as 
distinguished from those built into the walls of churches, or 
raised above the ground. 

	|21.  solo ai pii~: `to the compassionate alone.' 

	|22-24.  Si vid' io, &c.~: `with such figures, but of more 
perfect aspect corresponding to the craftsmanship, I saw there 
the whole space covered which projects from the mountain-side to
form a road.'  |di miglior...artificio~ signifies that these 
sculptures, like those on the walls which are described in Purg.
x. 28 foll. were of divine workmanship (^ibid.~ ll. 94-6), and 
consequently surpassed all human works of art. 

	|25-63.~  These lines, in which the examples of pride are 
described, are the most striking passage in respect of
symmetrical arrangement that occurs in the ^Div. Com.~  A 
similar, though less highly wrought, artificial system, is found
in Par. xix. 115-41; and in both cases the object aimed at is the
same, viz. to draw attention to a number of forcible examples by
which something is to be illustrated.  The symmetry in the
present passage is traceable (1) in the initial words of the 
tercets; (2) in the arrangement of the examples.  As regards the
former of these points it will be observed, that each example is
described in a single tercet; and that these tercets are marked 
off into groups of four by the correspondence of their initial 
words, those of the first group commencing with ^Vedea~ (ll. 25-
36), those of the second with ^O~ (ll. 37-48), and those of the 
third with ^Mostrava~ (ll. 49-60).  Finally, in the last tercet 
-- which contains the most comprehensive and typical example of 
the overthrow of pride, viz. the fall of Troy -- these three 
words are brought together, and form the initial words of the 
three lines which compose it (ll. 61-3).  Mr. Toynbee has further
suggested that the initial letters in these groups, viz. V, O,
and M, have themselves a significance, because they stand for
UOM, i.e. ^uomo~, `Man,' whose root-sin, the special cause of his
Fall, was pride.  They may thus have been intended to emphasize
the lesson which is inculcated by the instances of pride which
are here symmetrically arranged.  See Moore, ^Studies~, ii. p.
268.  As regards the second point; the examples throughout are
arranged in pairs, one of them being taken in each case from
Scripture, the other from heathen sources, as the following
enumeration will show -- Pair 1.  Lucifer and Briareus; 2. The
Giants and Nimrod; 3. Niobe and Saul; 4. Arachne and Rehoboam; 5.
Eriphyle and Sennacherib; 6. Cyrus and Holofernes.  Also, in
most, though not in all, of these pairs there is a well-marked
point of resemblance between the two examples.  Thus, Lucifer and
Briareus were cast down by lightning; the Giants and Nimrod
attempted to scale heaven; Eriphyle and Sennacherib were killed
by their sons; Cyrus and Holofernes were slain by a woman's hand.

	|25-27.~  Lucifer.  |Folgoreggiando~: Luke x. 18, `I beheld
Satan as lightning (Vulg. ^sicut fulgur.~) fall from heaven.' 
|da un lato~: take with |Vedea~, `I saw on one side of the
Cornice'; to this ^dall' altra parte~ corresponds in l. 29. 

	|28-30.  Vedea~: both here and in l. 61 Witte reads
^Vedeva~; and this is probably right, because (1) all Witte's 
test MSS. give ^Vedeva~; (2) if |Vedea~ is read, the termination
-^$ea~ in these two lines must be a disyllable; and this is a 
metrical solecism, for elsewhere it is always used as a
monosyllable for purposes of scansion, except at the end of a 
line.  It is objected to ^Vedeva~ that it breaks the uniformity 
of the commencement of the corresponding tercets.  This is the 
case; but the same objection applies, though in a lesser degree.
to |Vedea~, because with it also the symmetry is marred by its 
having to be pronounced and scanned in these two lines as a 
trisyllable, while in ll. 25, 31, and 34 it is a disyllable. 
|Briareo~: Dante here places Briareus, one of the Giants who 
assaulted heaven, apart from the other Giants, who are mentioned
in the next tercet; in this he is following Statius, ^Theb.~ ii.
595 foll.  |Grave~, &c.: `an oppressive weight to the earth from
being lifeless.' 

	|31-33.  Timbreo~: Apollo, who was called `Thymbraeus' as 
being worshipped at Thymbra in the Troad.  He bears that name in
Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 85 and Stat. ^Theb.~ i. 643.  |le membra~, &c.:
`the carnage of the Giants.'  The example of pride abased which
is here given is the slaughter of the Giants after their attempt
to scale heaven, and in the sculpture the triumphant divinities
are represented as contemplating their remains.  Apollo, Pallas,
and Mars are introduced by Statius in connexion with Briareus in
^Theb.~ ii. 597-9, and they were evidently suggested to Dante by
that passage, though he has transferred them to the story of the
Giants. 

	|34-36.  Nembrot~: Dante regarded Nimrod as being a giant 
(Inf. xxxi. 58-66), so that in this point he would correspond to
the classical giants.  He also believed that Nimrod built the 
Tower of Babel (|il gran lavoro~); for his authority on these 
points see note on Inf. xxxi. 77.  |smarrito~: `bewildered'; this
word and |riguardar~ express the helplessness produced by the 
confusion of tongues; cp. Inf. xxxi. 76 foll.  |Sennaar~: the 
tower of Babel, as we learn from Gen. x. 10, was erected in the 
land of Shinar (Vulg. |Sennaar~).  |superbi~: Gen. xi. 4; the 
builders of the tower said one to another `Let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a
name (^celebremus nomen nostrum~).' 

	|37-39.  Niobe~: Niobe boasted herself against Latona as 
having many children, while Latona had only Apollo and Diana; 
whereupon those deities in revenge slew all her sons and
daughters.  The story is from Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 146 foll., where 
the numbers of the children are given, `huc natas adiice septem 
Et totidem iuvenes,' ll. 182, 183 (|sette e sette~). 

	|40-42.  Saul~: cp. 1 Sam. xxxi. 1-6.  |Gelbo@e~: on the 
ten-syllable lines here see note on Inf. iv. 56.  |non senti~, 
&c.: 2 Sam. i. 21, `Ye mountains of Gilboa,' David exclaims, `let
there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you.' 

	|43-45.  Aragne~: Arachne challenged Minerva to compete with
her in weaving, but when she had completed her work Minerva tore
it in pieces.  Thereupon Arachne hanged herself in despair, but
Minerva saved her life, and changed her into a spider.  Ovid,
^Met.~  vi. 5 foll.  Both this story and that of Niobe are 
mentioned by Ovid as a warning against pride.  |stracci~:
`shreds'; those of Arachne's web, which Pallas had rent; Ovid, 
^Met.~ vi. 131.  |mal per te~: `in an evil hour for thee.' 

	|46-48.  Roboam~: the story here referred to is that of 
Rehoboam's defiant answer to the remonstrances of the people, 
followed by his hurried flight when he heard of his agent Adoram
being stoned; 1 Kings xii. 14, 18.  |Quivi~: on the Cornice.  |il
tuo segno~: `thy sculptured form.' 

	|50-51.  Almeon~, &c.: `Alcmaeon caused the luckless
ornament to appear to his mother too costly a gift.'  Eriphyle 
for the bribe of a necklace revealed the hiding-place of her 
husband Amphiaraus, and thus caused his death; but before he died
he charged his son Acmaeon to avenge him, and by him Eriphyle was
slain.  Her pride arose from the possession of the necklace;
Statius, ^Theb.~ ii. 265 foll. 

	|52-54.  i figli~, &c.: 2 Kings xix. 37.  Sennacherib's 
pride consisted in his defying the God of Israel, v. 22.  |quivi
il lasciaro~: v. 37, `they escaped into the land of Armenia.' 

	|55-57.  ruina~: `overthrow,' `rout of the army.' 
|scempio.~: `slaughter'; see note on Inf. x. 85.  Cyrus attacked
the Massagetae, and slew the son of their queen Tomyris, but 
afterwards was defeated with great slaughter, and himself lost 
his life.  Tomyris then ordered his head to be cut off and thrust
into a vessel full of blood.  Dante obtained the story from 
Orosius, ii. 7, where the words which he puts into the mouth of 
Tomyris occur, `Satia te sanguine quem sitisti.' 

	|58-60.  in rotta~, &c.: Judith xiii-xv.  Holofernes, whose
head was cut off by Judith, is described as `the chief captain of
Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians,' Judith ii. 4.  |le
reliquie del martiro~: the headless trunk of Holofernes; cp. Jud.
xiv. 18, `Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a head.' 

	|61.  Troia~: the fall of Troy is the crowning instance of
the overthrow of pride.  The pride of Troy is referred to in Inf.
i. 75; xxx. 14.  |caverne~: `gaping spaces,' i.e. intervals
between piles of ruin. 

	|62-63.  Ilion~: probably the citadel ofTroy is meant, for
Dante seems to be imitating Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 2, 3, `ceciditque
superbum Ilium (|Ilion...basso e vile~), et omnis humi fumat
Neptunia Troia (|Troia in cenere~).'  |Segno~: `portraiture'; cp.
l. 47. 

	|64-66.  Qual~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `What human artist 
could have portrayed the shades and outlines of these designs?' 
For the use of |qual~ cp. Inf. xxxii. 87.  |stile~: this word 
properly means a metal pencil for outline drawing.  |ogn' ingegno
sottile~: i.e. every one who possessed the power of fine 
appreciation. 

	|68-69.  il vero~: `the reality,' the actual objects
represented.  |Quant' io~, &c.: `of all that was beneath my feet
as far as I advanced in a stooping posture,' i.e. bending to 
examine them. 

	|72.  Si che~, &c.: `so as to see in these instances to 
what ruin your pride may lead.' 

	|73-75.  volto~: this word implies the circular form of 
the Cornice.  |del cammin~, &c.: `the day was further advanced 
than I was aware, being engrossed in the examination of these 
objects.' 

	|76-78.  atteso~: `watchful.'  |sospeso~: `preoccupied'; 
cp. Purg. xiii. 136. 

	|79-81.  un Angel~: this angel is the guardian of the
stairway leading to the second Cornice.  |torna~, &c.: `the sixth
handmaiden (of the day, i.e. the sixth hour) is returning from 
the service of the day'; in other words, `noon has just past'; 
for the expression |ancella del di~ signifying one of the hours,
cp. Purg. xxii. 118. 

	|83.  i~ for ^gli~; cp. Inf. xxii. 73: ^dilettare~ is
sometimes, though very rarely used with the dat.; see ^Vocab. 
Tramater.~ 

	|84.  Pensa~ &c.: from l. 86 we learn that this means, `make
the best use of the present time.' 

	|85-87.  uso~: for ^usato~, `familiar with.'  |chiuso~: 
`darkly,' so that I should fail to understand; cp. Par. xi. 73. 

	|93.  omai~: now that the weight of pride has been removed. 

	|94-96.  A questo~, &c.: some editors regard this and the 
two following lines, not as the words of the angel, but as the 
Poet's own remark; and it is true that they correspond to the 
comments which he makes elsewhere; cp. ll. 70-2; Purg. x. 121-9.
|Perch@e~, &c.: this continues the metaphor contained in ^volar 
su~: `why, instead of pursuing your upward flight, do you fall to
the earth when assailed by a slight blast of temptation to
pride?' 

	|97-98.  ove~, &c.: `where there was a rift in the rock.' 
|batt@eo~, &c.: it is thus that the first of the P's inscribed on
Dante's forehead is removed, as he presently discovers, l. 116.  

	|100.  Come~, &c.: the steep ascent is compared to the steps
by which the church of San Miniato at Florence is reached from
the city.  These ascended the hill to the right hand (|a man
destra~) of the ordinary and easier way, which led from the gate
of the city to the church. 

	|101-102.  soggioga~: `dominates,' rising high above it. 
|La ben guidata~: iron.; Florence, `the city of good government.'
|Rubaconte~: the easternmost of the bridges of Florence, which
lies under the hill of San Miniato; it was so called from
Rubaconte da Mandello, who, as Podest@a, laid the foundation
stone in 1237; Villani, vi. 26.  Its modern name is ^Ponte alle
Grazie.~ 

	|103-105.  del montar~, &c.: `the bold abruptness of the 
ascent.'  |ad etade~, &c.: i.e. in the good old times when 
honesty prevailed.  |il quaderno e la doga~: `the ledger and the
stave'; the reference is to two acts of official dishonesty -- 
the former of which consisted in abstracting a page containing 
compromising entries from the public ledger (cp. Par. xvi. 56), 
the latter in the diminution of the standard bushel measure by an
officer of customs by means of withdrawing a stave (cp. Par. xvi.
105). 

	|106-108.  cosi~: i.e. by steps.  |la ripa~: `the steep 
slope.'  |Ma~: in contrast to the openness of the steps leading 
to San Miniato.  |rade~: `presses close' on the path and those 
who pass along it. 

	|109-111.  Noi volgendo ivi~: `as we turned thitherward'; 
this is probably the meaning, for they are first described as 
ascending in l. 115.  |voci~, &c.: `was sung in words (lit. words
sang), the effect of which language could not express'; for the 
use of |voci~ cp. Purg. xxii. 5.  If the word is to be taken in 
its natural sense as `voices,' the Beatitude must be supposed to
have been uttered by more than one person -- perhaps by some of 
the spirits in the first Cornice.  But it is against this, that 
in five out of the other six Cornices -- and probably in the 
remaining one also, viz. Cornice V (cp. Purg. xxii. 4) -- it 
seems to be the Angel who recites the Beatitudes. 

	|112-113.  foci~: `entrances,' `approaches.' |canti~:
`strains ofjoy.' 

	|116-117.  troppo pi@u lieve~: `ever so much lighter'; for
|troppo~ in this sense cp. Purg. ix. 124; xiv. 125.  |per lo
pian~: on the level Cornice below.  Dante in ascending feels that
a weight has been taken off him, and learns from Virgil that this
is due to the removal of the first of the P's from his forehead. 

	|122.  presso ch' estinti~: pride being the original root of
sin, when it is removed the other sins tend to disappear. 

	|126.  pinti~: `impelled' by the force of the will. 

	|127.  Allor~, &c.: Dante puts his hand to his forehead to
discover what Virgil is referring to: this is compared to the 
action of one who perceives from the glances of the passers-by 
that he has some object on his head of which he is unaware. 

	|130.  ad accertar s' aiuta~: `applies itself to ascertain
the truth'; cp. Purg. xxxiii. 84. 

	|133-135.  scempie~: `outspread,' lit. `single,' i.e. not 
forming, as we say `a bunch of fives.'  |Quel dalle chiavi~: the 
Angel who had the keys of the gate of Purgatory; Purg. ix. 112.
