	|1-9.~  In these lines Dante intends to signify, though by a
long periphrasis, that it was sunrise in Purgatory.  In order to
understand this it is necessary to get an elementary idea of his
views of mathematical geography.  According to him the habitable
earth extends from E. to W. over half the circuit of the globe;
at its eastem extremity is the mouth of the Ganges, at its
western extremity Gades; Jerusalem is midway between these two
points; the Mountain of Purgatory is the antipodes of Jerusalem,
and consequently midway between Gades and the Ganges on the
opposite side of the globe (see Purg. iv. 67-71).  Hence -- to
take the circumstances described in the present passage -- when
it is sunset at Jerusalem, it will be midday at Gades, midnight
at the mouth of the Ganges, and sunrise at the Mountain of
Purgatory.  The whole passage should be compared with Purg.
xxvii. 1-5, which is very similar to it as a description of 
the time of day. 

	|1-3.  orizzonte~: by this is intended the horizon line on
which Gades lay, and which was the common horizon of Jerusalem 
and the Mountain of Purgatory.  |Lo cui~, &c.: i.e. `the highest
point of the meridian circle of which lies over Jerusalem.'  In 
plain English the three lines mean -- `The sun had now reached 
the horizon at the meridian of Jerusalem'; in other words, `it 
was sunset at Jerusalem.'  The explanation of the expression `the
meridian circle of the horizon' is this.  The meridian, or 
meridian circle, of a place is a great circle of the heavens, 
which passes through its zenith (|il suo pi@u alto punto~) and 
through the poles, and is crossed by the sun when it is noonday 
at that place.  And as the meridian circle of a place crosses the
horizon of that place at two points, and divides it into two 
equal parts, it can be spoken of as the meridian circle of that 
horizon, and this is what Dante does in the present passage. 

	|4.  la notte~, &c.: Night, which is here personified, is 
identified with its central point, i.e. midnight, and so is 
spoken of in terms of place as being opposite to the sun. 

	|5.  colle bilance~: the sun being in Aries, the point 
opposite to it was Libra, the sign of the zodiac opposite to 
Aries. 

	|6.  Che le caggion~, &c.: `which fall from the hand of 
night when she wins the mastery.'  Night wins the mastery over 
the sun when it extends over more than half the 24 hours, i.e.
after the autumnal equinox.  The Scales (Libra) `fall from her 
hand' at that time, because the sun is then in that
constellation, so that night has no power over them. 

	|8-9.  L@a dove io era~: at the foot of the Mountain of 
Purgatory.  |Per troppa etate~: `from advanced age,' i.e. from 
the near approach of sunrise. 

	|11.  Come gente~, &c.: i.e. in a lingering frame of 
mind. 

	|13.  sul presso del mattino~: `at the approach of morn'; 
|presso~ is a prep. and |sul presso~ is formed on the analogy of
^all' incirca~ and similar phrases.  Another reading is ^sorpreso
dal mattino~ (`surprized by the morn') but the meaning here is 
farfetched. 

	|14.  Per li grossi vapor~: `owing to its dense vapours.' 
Mars was supposed to generate vapours; cp. Inf. xxiv. 145,
`Tragge Marte vapor di val di Magra'; ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 164- 
7, `esso (i.e. Marte) appare affocato di colore, quando pi@u e 
quando meno, secondo la spessezza e rarit@a delli vapori che'l 
seguono.' 

	|16.  s' io~, &c.: `so may I once more behold it!'  This 
is Dante's prayer for his own salvation, the first condition of 
which would be his own admittance to Purgatory after his death. 

	|22-24.  d' ogni lato~: `on either side'; for |ogni~ cp. 
Inf. vii. 32; xxii. 56.  |Un non~, &c.: `an indistinct white 
object'; this was the wings of the angel, while |un altro~, which
was |di sotto~, was his garment. 

	|26.  Mentre che~, &c.: `until the first white objects 
revealed themselves as wings.' 

	|30.  di si fatti~, &c.: `such like ministers of God.' 

	|31-33.  argomenti~: `means,' `instruments'; cp. Purg. xxx.
136, where it signifies `expedients.'  |liti si lontani~: the 
mouth of the Tiber, where the souls that were destined for 
Purgatory assembled (see ll. 100-5), and the Mountain of 
Purgatory. 

	|35-36.  Trattando~: `moving.'  |mortal pelo~: `the feathers
of mortal birds.' 

	|40-42.  sen venne~: `came on.'  |Tanto che~, &c.: `so light
that no part of it was submerged,' lit. `the water engulfed no
part of it.' 

	|44.  Tal che parea beato per iscripto~: `so glorious that
he looked as though he were blessed by a sure title,' lit. `by a
written warrant.'  This reading has the authority of 123 MSS., as
against 31 for ^Tal che faria beato pur descritto~ (Moore, ^Text.
Crit.~, p. 372), which is also the easier reading.  The latter
should be translated, `so glorious that the mere description of
him would enchant the mind.' 

	|46.  IN exitu~, &c.: the spirits are celebrating their 
deliverance from the world of sin and sorrow by singing Ps. cxiv,
the subject of which, the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, is
a familiar type of the redemption of mankind. 

	|52-54.  selvaggia~, &c.: `strange to the place.'  |nuove 
cose~, &c.: `makes trial of a new experience.' 

	|55.  Da tutte parti~: `in every direction'; for |da~ cp. 
Inf. xx. 13; xxii. 146. 

	|56.  colle saette conte~: `with its clear shafts': ^conto~
(Lat. ^cognitus~) is used of what is `clearly known' in Inf. iii.
76, and here, according to this interpretation, is applied to
`clear' light; but such a transference of meaning from a mental
to a material application is altogether unusual.  Possibly
^conto~ might be derived from Lat. ^comptus~, and in that case it
might mean `polished' here. 

	|57.  Di mezzo~, &c.: `the sun had chased Capricorn beyond
the meridian'; the succession of the heavenly bodies is imagined
as a pursuit.  What is implied here is that the sun was above the
horizon.  The interval between Aries (in which the sun was) and
Capricorn is a quarter of the zodiac; consequently, if Capricorn
had cleared the meridian, Aries (and with it the sun) would be
above the horizon.  The expression ^saettava il giorno~ in l. 55,
however, suggests that the time was only just after sunrise, and
this is confirmed by the words ^fiammeggiava roggio~ in iii. 16,
which would hardly be used of the sun if it had risen more than a
short time. 

	|70-72.  olivo~: the olive branch, which in ancient times 
was the token of peace, was used in Dante's time as a sign of 
good news in general; cp. Villani, xii. 105, `E mandonne lettere
e messi con olivo al nostro comune significando la sua gran 
vittoria.'  |calcar~: `treading on others.'  The meaning of `to 
throng,' which ^calcare~ bears (Purg. x. 79), is derived from 
this. 

	|75.  d' ire~, &c.: i.e. to go on their way to Purgatory
proper, where they would be purified from sin.  In saying |a
farsi belle~ Dante refers to the consolatory view of Purgatory,
as he usually does elsewhere; cp. Purg. iii. 73, `gi@a spiriti
eletti.'

	|80-81.  Tre volte~, &c.: cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 700, 701,
`Ter conatus ibi collo dare brachia circum; Ter frustra comprensa
manus effugit imago.' 

	|82.  Di maraviglia~, &c.: i.e. I expressed my surprise in
my countenance. 

	|89-90.  sciolta~: the fem. is used because he is speaking
of himself as a spirit (^anima~); in l. 100, where there is no
such special reference, he uses the masc. |tu~: `you,' who are
still alive. 

	|91.  Casella~: a musician and friend of Dante; in l. 93 
it is implied that he had been dead some time.  |per tornare~, 
&c.: `the object of my present journey is that I may return to
this place at a future time.'  The lessons of Hell and Purgatory
were necessary, in order to recall Dante to the way of salvation,
and so to enable him after death to reach Purgatory, and through
it Paradise. 

	|93.  a te~, &c.: `how comes it that so long a time has been
lost to you?' i.e. `Why this long delay' between the time of your
death and your arrival here? For |tanta ora~ (= `so long time')
cp. ^poc' ora~, `short time,' in Inf. xxxiv. 104.  There is
considerable authority here for ^tanta terra~ (meaning `this
great realm of Purgatory') in place of |tanta ora~; but the words
can hardly bear this sense. 

	|95.  leva~: `takes on board'; like Engl. `takes ^up~ 
passengers,' cp. ^tolto~ in l. 98.  The idea expressed in this 
passage was suggested by Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 315, 316. 

	|97.  di giusto voler~, &c.: the angel's will is determined
by the will of God. 

	|98-99.  Veramente~: `nevertheless'; cp. Purg. vi. 43.  |da
tre mesi~: as the date of the present action of the poem is April
10, 1300, the three months here spoken of are the first three
months of that year: and as this was the great year of Jubilee,
in which pardons and indulgences were freely dispensed, it is
here implied that during this period a corresponding freedom had
been allowed to the souls of the dead in respect of the transit
to Purgatory.  |con tutta pace~: take with |tolto~, `has taken on
board with full acquiescence'; for |pace~ in this sense cp. ^con
tua pace~, `with your permission,' and similar uses.

	|100-101.  era ora...volto~: `had just at that time betaken
myself to.'  |s' insala~: `becomes salt'; or, `enters the sea.'
According to Dante, the souls who die in peace with God assemble
at the mouth of the Tiber, and are transported thence by the
angel.  The idea of the shore as the starting-point, like that of
the ferry-boat, is of classical origin; but the selection of this
place in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome can hardly fail to
mean that they are under the protection of the Church. 

	|103.~  A |quella foce~: `to that river-mouth.'  The angel
who had just left them had betaken himself thither to fetch a
fresh band of souls. 

	|104-105.  si ricoglie~: both this point and the souls 
being ferried across form a counterpart to the assembling of the
condemned souls on the shore of Acheron and their passage in 
Charon's boat in Inf. iii. 82 foll.  |Qual~, &c.: i.e. all who 
are not doomed to descend to Hell. 

	|106.  nuova legge~: the idea that laws unknown on earth 
may prevail in Purgatory seems to have been suggested by ^quella
legge~ of Purg. i. 89, by which Cato was forbidden to retain his
love for Marcia. 

	|110.  la sua persona~: the corruptible body which presseth
down the soul, Wisdom ix. 15. 

	|112.  Amor~, &c.: `Love that within my mind doth hold
discourse'; this is the first line of the Canzone with which Bk.
III of the ^Convito~ commences. 

	|117.  Come~: for ^come se~; `as if they were all absorbed
by this alone. 

	|119.  il veglio~: Cato. 

	|122.  scoglio~: `slough,' `husk,' `skin,' in which senses
^scoglia~ is more commonly used: Here it means a `film' over the
eyes which dims the sight. 

	|130-132.  fresca~: `newly arrived.'  |la costa~: `the 
mountainside.'  |n@e sa~, &c.: this describes the headlong flight
of the spirits.
