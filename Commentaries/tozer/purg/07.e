	|3.  si trasse~: `withdrew' from the embrace of Virgil. 

	|4-5.  Prima che~, &c.: `before Purgatory existed,' i.e. 
before the death of Christ, by which the way to eternal life was
opened; until that happened there was no place for Purgatory,
which was preparatory for admission into heaven. 

	|6.  per Ottavian~: `by order of Octavianus (Augustus).' 
Dante's authority for this statement seems to be Donatus' `Life 
of Virgil,' in which he is said to have been buried at Naples 
`iussu Augusti.'  There are two versions of Donatus' `Life,' one 
interpolated, the other uninterpolated.  Dante must have used the
former, in which these words occur, whereas they are not found in
the uninterpolated version.  See Nettleship's ^Ancient Lives of 
Vergil~, pp. 1, 17. 

	|10.  innanzi s@e~: the introduction of the ten-syllable
line here and in the rhyming verses may possibly be explained as
an adaptation of sound to sense, the abrupt termination 
corresponding to the sudden movement expressed by ^Subita~, l. 
11.  See note on Inf. xxxi. 145. 

	|15.  ove~, &c.: `where an inferior clasps his superior': 
the feet are meant; cp. Purg. xxi. 130, where it is said of 
Statius, `Gi@a si chinava ad abbracciar li piedi Al mio Dottor.'
In Latin vestigia prensare' is similarly used; cp. also Matt. 
xxviii. 9, `they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped 
him.' 

	|18.  loco~: Mantua. 

	|21.  d' inferno~: this is suggested by Virgil's having said
that he had forfeited heaven, ll. 7, 8.  |chiostra~: `circle';
the word is used in like manner of the ^bolge~ in Malebolge, Inf.
xxix. 40. 

	|24.  Virt@u del ciel~: `a heaven-sent influence,' viz. that
of Beatrice, the `donna di virt@u' of Inf. ii. 76. 

	|25-26.  per non far~: i.e. `per non aver f@e,' l. 8; cp.
Inf. iv. 37-38.  |L' alto Sol~: the face of God.

	|28-30.  Loco~: Limbo.  |tenebre~: Virgil is describing the
character of Limbo generally, not that of the part inhabited by
the illustrious spirits, which was bright.  |sospiri~: cp. Inf.
iv. 26, `Non avea pianto, ma' che di sospiri.'  The description
here given corresponds throughout to that passage. 

	|33.  esenti~: freed from original sin by receiving baptism;
Inf. iv. 35. 

	|34.  le tre~, &c.: the Christian graces of faith, hope, and
charity. 

	|39.  dritto inizio~: `its proper commencement,' i.e. the 
entrance to Purgatory proper. 

	|40.  Loco certo~, &c.: Sordello probably means, that he and
the rest of the class of spirits who were assigned to this part
of Ante-Purgatory might go where they liked within the limits of
that part.  But there is also an imitation of Virg. ^Aen.~ vi.
673, `Nulli certa domus.' 

	|42.  Per quanto~, &c.: `as far as I am allowed to go,' 
i.e. as far as the gate of Purgatory, for as he was one of the 
Negligent he was not allowed to enter. 

	|46-47.  rimote~: `withdrawn'; the separate position
allotted to them is a tribute to their dignity.  |merr@o~: for 
^mener@o.~ 

	|51.  o non sarria~, &c.: `or would he not ascend, because
he would have no power to do so?'  |sarria~ is for ^saliria~; the
forms ^sarr@o, sarrei~ from ^salire~ are also found, but |sarria~
was sufficiently unusual to be misunderstood, and from this arose
the reading ^o non saria~, which has about equal authority with
that in the text; Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 382. 

	|52.  freg@o~: `drew along,' so as to mark a line; it is 
the Lat. ^fricare.~  Similarly in Inf. xvi. 33 ^fregare~ means 
`to trail.' 

	|55-57.  briga~: `impediment.'  |col non poter~, &c.:
`hampers the will by want of power.' 

	|58-60.  con lei~: `during the dark hours.'  The allegorical
meaning ofthe passage is, that when the soul of man is not
illuminated by heavenly grace it cannot rise, but it may fall
back or spend itself in wandering.  |Mentre che~, &c.: `while the
horizon excludes the day,' i.e. while the sun is below the
horizon: allegorically, `until the Sun of Righteousness once more
arises.' 

	|65-66.  scemo~: `hollowed.'  |quici~: in the world of the
living.

	|68.  grembo~: lit. `lap,' `hollow'; `where the hillside
retires'; cp. ^seno~, l. 76, and Lat. ^sinus~ in the same sense. 

	|70-71.  Tra erto e piano~: `between steep and level,' i.e.
neither quite steep nor quite level.  |sghembo~: `winding';
perhaps from Lat. ^scambus~, `bow-legged.'  |in fianco della
lacca~: `to the side of the dell.'  For |lacca~ = `hollow' see
note on Inf. vii. 16. 

	|72.  L@a dove~, &c.: `where the rim (of the valley) is
diminished to less than half its (average) depth.'  The |lembo~ 
is the slope between the path and the place where the princes 
were seated; and this, as we learn from Purg. viii. 46, was here
only three paces downwards.  This was the reason why they stopped
at this point.  From the expression `la picciola vallea' in Purg.
viii. 98 we may infer that the place was a mere nook in the 
hillside.

	|73~ foll.  The Flowery Valley or ^Valletta dei Principi~ is
occupied by the fourth class of spirits in Ante-Purgatory, viz.
those of Princes who had been negligent during their lifetime
owing to the pressure of public cares in governing their
kingdoms.  The description of the Valley, together with the 
approach to it, and the mighty shades who occupy it, was probably
suggested by Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 675-81; but as the flowers and 
other agreeable surroundings are nowhere spoken of by Dante as 
being a source of present enjoyment to the Princes, we may infer
that they are intended to have an allegorical significance -- 
which is, to symbolize the splendour and worldly enjoyments of 
the life of monarchs.  See further on this subject in note on 
Purg. viii. 25. 

	|73.  cocco~: `cochineal,' the material used for producing a
scarlet colour.  |biacca~: `white lead'; the colour here intended
is `pearlywhite,' as distinguished from the brilliant white of
|argento fino.~ 

	|74.  Indico legno~, &c.: `Indian wood with clear harmonious
tints'; what is meant is probably some brown wood which took a
fine polish.  No evidence seems to be forthcoming of such a wood
having been imported into Italy from India at that time, but this
does not necessarily disprove it.  There is much, however, to be
said for punctuating ^Indico, legno lucido e sereno~, in which
case ^Indico~ will mean indigo, and ^legno lucido e sereno~ a
polished brown wood; the introduction of blue through the mention
of indigo makes the enumeration of colours more complete. 

	|75.  Fresco~: `clear,' `undimmed,' as the emerald is `at 
the moment when it is broken or flaked'; it becomes dull in 
colour from exposure. 

	|76.  Dall' erba~: `in contrast with (lit. by the side 
of) the grass.' 

	|79-81.  pur~: take with |dipinto~: `Nature had not merely
used colour, but fragrance also.'  |un incognito~, &c.: `a
perfume all unknown and subtly blended.' 

	|82.  Salve Regina~: this is the beginning of the Compline
Hymn to the Virgin, which is suitable here, both because of its
being sung towards nightfall, and because of the reference made
in it to the soul being in exile in the Valley of Tears, as the
occupants of the ^Valletta~ were excluded from Purgatory.  In 
the hymn beginning `Salve nobilis regina,' which is known as 
`Salve Regina' (Mone, ^Hymni Latini Medii Aevi~, vol. 2. No. 
489), are the lines -- `In hac valle lacrimarum Nos gementes 
dirige' (ll. 33, 34). 

	|84.  per la valle~: `owing to the concavity of the valley.'

	|86.  volti~: `directed,' `conducted'; cp. Purg. xxii. 2. 

	|88-90.  balzo~: `ridge'; cp. Purg. iv. 47.  |Che nella
lama~, &c.: `than if you were received among them in the level 
below'; for |lama~ cp. Inf. xx. 79.

	|91~ foll.  It has already been mentioned in note to Purg.
vi. 58, that Sordello had been an inmate of numerous European
courts; and it is probably for this reason, as Benvenuto
suggests, that Dante has assigned to him the office of pointing
out and naming the potentates who are here seated in the Flowery
Valley.  This view is confirmed by the mention in one of
Sordello's most famous poems -- the lament on the death of
Blacatz (No. 5 in De Lollis, ^Vita e poesie di Sordello~) -- of
several of those whom Dante here introduces.  As regards the
remarks on the looks and attitudes of the Princes, which Dante
puts into his mouth, it is noticeable that they are represented
as showing regret rather for their faults in administration or
for the shortcomings of their successors, than for their own
neglect of religion.  In doing this, Dante was availing himself
of an opportunity for criticizing the politics of the time. 

	|91.  pi@u sied' alto~: this was his right in the character
of emperor.  |fa sembianti~: `has the look.' 

	|94-95.  Ridolfo~: the emperor Rudolf, father of the emperor
Albert (`il tuo padre,' Purg. vi. 103); they were `Per cupidigia
di cost@a distretti,' ^ibid.~ l. 104.  |hanno...morta~: `have
slain'; cp. Par. xvi. 137. 

	|96.  Si che tardi~, &c.: `so that its recovery by another
tarries long,' i.e. is late in coming.  |altri~ is sing., and
refers to Henry of Luxemburg, whose possible advent is here
anticipated by Dante.  That the meaning of |tardi~ is that here
given -- and not `too late,' with reference to the failure of
that Emperor's attempt to establish the imperial power in Italy
in consequence of his death -- is proved by Purg. vi. 102, in
which passage it is implied that this part of the poem was
written during Henry's lifetime. 

	|97-99.  nella vista~: i.e. to judge from his look of
sympathy, lit. `as you may see in his looks'; cp. Purg. i. 79. 
|la terra~: Bohemia.  The clauses which follow afford an instance
of Dante's fondness for geographical detail, especially in
respect of rivers.  Instead of naming Bohemia, he mentions the 
Moldau (|Molta~), which rises in it, and then traces the course 
of that stream, and that of the Elbe (|Albia~), of which it is a
tributary.

	|100-102.  Ottacchero~: Ottocar II, king of Bohemia.  He was
killed in battle, when fighting against the emperor Rudolf in
1278.  |nelle fasce~: `he in the swaddling clothes was superior
to his son when a grown man (|barbuto).'  Vincislao~: Wenceslaus
IV; he was no warrior, and was at once devout and licentious. 
Dante attributes the same character to him in Par. xix. 125. 

	|103-105.  quel Nasetto~: `he of the small nose'; this 
describes Philip the Bold of France (reigned 1270-1285): Witte 
(Notes to Germ. Trans., p. 155) remarks on this feature as 
appearing on his effigy at Narbonne.  He invaded Catalonia in a 
war with Peter III of Aragon, but was forced to retreat, and died
at Perpignan.  |stretto a consiglio~: `earnestly conversing.' 
|colui~: Henry the Fat of Navarre; his character in history seems
not to have corresponded to his |benigno aspetto.~  |disfiorando
il giglio~: dishonouring the ^fleur-de-lys'~ on the banner of 
France. 

	|109.  mal di Francia~: Philip the Fair, son of Philip the
Bold, who married the daughter of Henry of Navarre.  In Dante's
eyes his greatest offences were the transference of the seat of
the Papacy to Avignon (Purg. xxxiii. 45), and his sacrilegious
treatment of Boniface VIII (Purg. xx. 86, 91). 

	|112-114.  membruto~: `large of limb'; this is Peter III of 
Aragon, who after the Sicilian Vespers won the kingdom of Sicily
from Charles I of Anjou (|colui del maschio naso~).  |S'
accorda~, &c.: `sings (the "Salve Regina") in harmony with'; this
is introduced to show that after death those who before were
enemies are perfectly reconciled.  The case was the same as
regards Rudolf and Ottocar above.  |maschio naso~: Villani (vii. 
describes Charles of Anjou as `con grande naso.'  |D' ogni~, &c.:
`wore round his loins the girdle of all worth'; the metaphor is a
common one in Scripture, e.g. Ps. lxv. 6, `girded about with
power.' 

	|116-117.  Lo giovinetto~: Alfonso, eldest son and successor
of Peter III, who died early.  |andava~: `would have passed'; on
the irregular sequence of the indic. after ^se fosse~ see note on
Inf. xxix. 38.  |valor~: `worth,' `good qualities.'  |vaso~: 
`possessor,' lit. `vessel,' `receptacle.' 

	|118.  erede~: in O. Ital. the sing. ^ereda~ and plur.
^erede~ are found, and they are fem., the word being regarded as
an abstract subst., like ^guida, scorta~, &c.; cp. Par. xi. 112. 

	|119-120.  Jacomo e Federico~: James succeeded on his
father's death to the throne of Sicily; when he became king of 
Aragon on the death of Alfonso in 1291, he ceded the government 
of Sicily to his brother Frederic.  |Del retaggio~, &c.: `neither
of them possesses aught of the better heritage,' i.e. of their 
father's virtues. 

	|121-123.  risurge per li rami~: `passes from father to
son.'  |perch@e~, &c.: `in order that it may be regarded as His 
gift.' 

	|124-126.  Anche~, &c.: `my remarks on the degeneracy of 
sons apply also in the case of Charles of Anjou (^colui del 
maschio naso~, l. 113), as well as to Peter of Aragon, who is 
singing with him.'  |Onde~, &c.: i.e. in consequence of the 
misgovernment of his son, Charles II of Anjou, who was king of 
Naples and Count of Provence, those countries suffer. 

	|127-129.  Tant' @e~, &c.: `the plant (Charles II) is as 
inferior to the seed from which it sprang (i.e. his father, 
Charles I), as Constance (wife of Peter of Aragon) more than 
Beatrice and Margaret (the wives of Charles I of Anjou and his 
brother Louis IX of France), still prides herself on her
husband.'  The meaning of the passage is: -- Charles II is as 
inferior to Charles I, as Charles I and his brother Louis are 
to Peter III.  The depreciation of St. Louis which this implies 
is of a part with Dante's silence with regard to him throughout 
the whole poem, especially in the Paradiso, where we should 
certainly have expected him to be mentioned.  The Beatrice and 
Margaret who are here spoken of were sisters, being the daughters
of Raymond Berenger.  |ancor~: this means, that she still
cherished his memory, though he had been dead fifteen years -- 
since 1285.  She did not die herself till 1302, and consequently
was alive at the time which Dante assigns to his Vision. 

	|130-132.  semplice~: Villani also (v. 4) says of Henry III,
`fu semplice uomo e di buona f@e.'  |solo~: as being of a remote
race and country; the same thing is said of Saladin (Inf. iv.
129) and of Guy of Montfort (Inf. xii. 118).  |migliore uscita~:
Edward I. 

	|133.  pi@u basso~: `in a lower place than the others'; this
was on account of his inferior dignity, just as the emperor
Rudolf occupies the highest position in virtue of his office. 

	|134.  in suso~: probably in devotion.  |Guglielmo
Marchese~: William, surnamed Spadalunga, marquis of Monferrat and
Canavese, districts of what is now Piedmont.  In 1290 he marched
against Alessandria, the people of which place had risen against
him, but he was made prisoner by them and died in captivity. 

	|135.  Per cui~: `on whose account.'  His son Giovanni
advanced against Alessandria to avenge his death, but ended by 
losing part of his dominions.  Hence Monferrat and Canavese are 
here spoken of as lamenting their losses in the war with
Alessandria.
