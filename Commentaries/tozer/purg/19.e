	|1.  ora~: we have now reached the hour before dawn on
Tuesday, April 12, the third day on the Mountain of Purgatory. 
That this hour is meant, is shown (1) by its being the coldest of
the twenty-four, ll. 1-3; (2) by the later stars of Aquarius and
the foremost ones of Pisces being on the horizon (ll. 4-6), for 
these stars would now be rising shortly before daybreak, since 
the sun was in Aries, the next sign of the zodiac.  |non pu@o, 
&c.~: what is implied is, that the heat of the day continues to 
temper the cold of night until the last hour before dawn. 

	|2.  della luna~: `caused by the moon'; the moon is
generally regarded as producing cold.  The origin of this belief
is, that clear bright nights are the coldest because then the 
radiation is greater. 

	|3.  da terra~: `by the chilliness of the earth.'  |da 
Saturno.~: Saturn was known as the cold planet; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 
14. l. 201, `la freddura di Saturno'; Virg. ^Georg.~ i. 336, 
`frigida Saturni...stella.'  |talor~, `sometimes,' is added, 
because Saturn is not always above the horizon. 

	|4.  i geomanti, &c.~: Geomancy is divination by spots on 
the ground, one arrangement of which, viz. ::.., was called 
^Fortuna maior.~  The stars which were supposed to resemble 
this group, viz. the later stars of Aquarius and the foremost 
ones of Pisces, were now just above the eastern horizon. 

	|6.  per via, &c.~: `by a path which remains but a short 
time dusk for it,' i.e. for the ^maggior fortuna~, or rather, 
for the stars which form it.  The `path' is the eastern sky, 
which will soon be illuminated by the rising sun, so that these 
stars will disappear. 

	|7-9.  in sogno~: the figure of a woman which is introduced
in the dream is explained in ll. 58, 59 as representing the vices
of avarice, gluttony, and lust, which are expiated in the three
remaining Cornices, and which may be classified together as
^cupidity.~  The dream is an allegory of the deceitfulness of the
things which attract worldly and carnal men.  (On the subject of
Dante's three dreams in Purgatory see note on Purg. ix. 19.)
|femmina~: the woman is first seen as she is in reality -- a
hideous object, with stammering lips, squinting eyes, deformed
feet, maimed hands, and pallid complexion.  The allegorical
interpretation of these traits is, that worldly and carnal
pleasures are destructive of clear reasoning, straightforward
judgement, active movement, and useful employment, and produce an
unhealthy tone of mind. 

	|10-15.~  This repulsive figure is idealized by the 
imagination of one who gazes long upon it, so that its defects 
pass out of sight, and it exercises a powerful attraction upon 
him. -- Similarly, the pleasures of the world and of sense dazzle
the man who falls under their influence, so that their true 
nature is concealed from him.  |facea scorta La lingua~: `gave 
fluency to her tongue'; |scorta~, `apt' to speak; cp. Villani, 
viii. 10, `scorti in ben parlare.' |la driz. zava~: 
`straightened her distorted limbs.'  |lo smarrito, &c.~:
`invested her ghastly face with the proper hue of love,' i.e.
rosy tints. 

	|20.  dismago~: `cause to be distraught in mind,' lit.
`deprive of power.'  The more usual form of the word is
^smagare~; for the etymology see note on Purg. x. 106. 

	|22-23.  Io volsi, &c.~: `I turned aside Ulysses from his
wandering course.'  Homer makes Ulysses successfully resist the
Sirens, but Dante, who was unacquainted with Homer, may have got
the story from Cicero, who in ^De Fin.~  v. 18. 49 adapts the
Homeric version of it, and speaks of Ulysses as being `ensnared'
(^irretitus~).  See Moore, ^Studies~, i. pp. 264, 265.  |meco si
ausa~: `shares my intimacy.' 

	|26.  una, donna~: this is co-operative grace, which sets 
in motion human reason (Virgil) to reveal the deceptions of 
sensuality. 

	|29.  Fieramente~: she says these words `in indignation' at
the false character of the Siren. 

	|31.  prendeva~: the subject of this is Virgil who carries
out the behests of the `lady'; allegorically -- human reason
aroused by grace, strips off the false show which conceals the
repulsiveness of vice.  If the `lady' were the subject, as some
take it, there would be no reason for introducing Virgil at all. 

	|36.  la porta~: the entrance to the stairway.  Others read
^l' aperta~, for which word in the sense of ^apertura~ cp. Purg.
iv. 19. 

	|39.  andavam, &c.~: as the sun was behincL them (|alle 
reni~), and had risen some little while, their direction was now
south-westward. 

	|42.  fa di s@e, &c.~: i.e. stoops in walking. 

	|43-45.  Venite, &c.~: `come ye; here is the passage'; these
words proceed from the Angel of the fourth Cornice.  |marca~: 
`region'; der. from Germ. ^Mark~, `frontier,' Engl. `march.' 

	|47.  Volseci in su~: `directed us upward.' 

	|49-51.  ventilonne~: `fanned us'; here the fourth P is 
removed from Dante's forehead; cp. Purg. xvii. 68, `ventarmi nel
viso.'  |Qui lugent~: this is the Beatitude which is used in this
Cornice.  It is not easy to discover any special appropriateness
in its use, the nearest approach to this being the circumstance 
that the inmates of the Cornice pass ^piangendo~, Purg. xviii.
99.  |avran, &c.~: `they shall be comforted,' lit. `they shall 
have their souls possessed of (i.e. in possession of)
consolation.' 

	|54.  sormontati~: a pendent participle; `we two having 
mounted somewhat above the Angel,' lit. `from where the Angel 
was.' 

	|55.  suspizion~: `misgiving.' 

	|58-60.  quella antica strega, &c.~: `that ancient witch 
(Cupidity), who is the sole cause of the sufferings that remain 
for us to see in the three Cornices above us'; see note on l. 7.
|omai~: `from this point onward.'  |si piagne~: lit. `is lamented
for.'  |si slega~: `can liberate himself'; cp. Purg. xv. 119. 

	|61-63.  Bastiti~: `enough!' no further teaching is needed. 
|batti, &c.~: `press vigorously forward,' lit. `let thy footsteps
strike the earth.'  |logoro~: the `lure' is the attraction of the
celestial spheres, which God himself causes to move before men's
eyes; cp. Purg. xiv. 148, 149.  The metaphor is derived from
falconry, and suggests the simile which follows; see note on Inf.
xvii. 128. 

	|64-66.  ai pi@e si mira~: i.e. is looking downwards; this
describes the posture of the bird in repose, before it is aroused
by the cry of its prey (|si volge al grido~); it thus corresponds
to Dante's absorbed condition and downward looks, l. 52. 
|pasto~: the falcon was always allowed his share of the prey. 
|l@a~: towards the prey, which is implied in |grido.~

	|67-69.  e tal.~  `and in such a spirit,' i.e. as one
aroused  from inertness to action.  |ove il cherchiar~, &c.:
`where one commences to move round' along the curve of the
Cornice.

	|70.  quinto giro~: in the Cornice (1) the sin punished is
avarice or covetousness; (2) the mode of punishment is by being
extended face downwards on the earth; (3) the examples of the
virtues which are opposed to this sin, viz. poverty and
liberality, are the Blessed Virgin, Fabricius, St. Nicolas; (4)
the examples of the vice are Pygmalion and Midas; Achan, Ananias
and Sapphira, and Heliodorus; Polymester and Crassus; (5) the
mode of presentation of these is by one spirit speaking; (6) the
passage from a Church Office is Ps. cxix. 25; (7) the Beatitude
is ^Beati qui sitiunt.~  |fui dischiuso~: `I had come forth
clear.'  

	|72.  Giacendo~, &c.: the position is symbolical of the
grovelling nature of avarice.

	|73.  Adhaesit~, &c.: Ps. cxix. 25.

	|77-78.  giustizia~: the sense of God's justice, which
caused them to be resigned.  |saliri~: `ascents' of the mountain. 
Both in this word and in |soffriri~ above the infin. has become
so completely substantival as to be used in the plur.

	|79-81.  dal giacer~: i.e. from the punishment of this
Cornice.  |furi~: for ^fuori.~  If they advanced in this manner,
i.e. keeping the precipice on their right hand, they would be
taking the usual direction along the mountain-side.

	|83-84.  ne~: `from (one of) them.'  |Nel parlare~, &c.: `by
his words I became aware of what else of him was hidden from me';
i.e. though I could not distinguish him as he lay face downwards
on the ground, I discovered his presense from his speaking; cp.
l. 90.

	|87.  la vista del disio~: `my eager looks.'

	|88-90.  potei~, &c.: i.e. as having obtained Virgil's
assent.  |notar mi fenno~: `attracted my attention,'

	|92-93.  Quel~, &c.: the purification of the soul is meant. 
|tua maggior cura~: `the work on which thou art intent,' i.e. the
expression of penitence.

	|94-96.  avete~: the plur. number implies `you and your 
associates.'  |se vuoi~, &c.: what Dante means is -- `tell me 
whether you wish me to obtain for you the prayers of the living.'
|di l@a~, &c.: `in the world which I left while still alive.' 

	|97-98.  Perch@e, &c.~: this is another way of saying, `Thou
shalt know why heaven causes us to turn our eyes away from it.'
The explanation is given in ll. 118-20. 

	|99.  Scias, &c.~: `be it known to you that,' &c.  The
speaker is Pope Adrian V, who was elected in 1276 and was pope 
only 39 days.  There is nothing in history to confirm the 
imputation of avarice which is here brought against him.  The 
declaration which he here makes is in Latin, because that was the
official language of the Papacy; similarly, Dante employs it as 
the language of the Church or of Canon Law in Par. xii. 93, and 
as the language of dignity in Par. xv. 28-30. 

	|100-102.  Intra, &c.~: the river here spoken of is the 
Lavagna, which flows down (|si adima~) between the towns of 
Sestri and Chiavari on the eastern Riviera.  |del suo nome, &c.~:
`the title of my family glories (|fa sua cima~) in its name.' 
Adrian's family, the Fieschi of Genoa, were Counts of Lavagna. 

	|109.  li~: in the position of highest Pontiff. 

	|115-116.  Quel che, &c.~: `the effect of avarice (i.e. the
debased character which it produces) is shown by the nature of
the punishment by which it is purged'; see ll. 118-20.
|converse~: `which repented' before death.

	|118-120.  aderse~: `uplifted,' from ^adergere~, Lat.
^aderigere.~  |merse~: `sank.' 

	|122.  onde, &c.~: `in consequence of which the power of 
working was lost,' because the love of good is the mainspring of
right action. 

	|127-129.  inginocchiato~: Dante knelt to show reverence for
the Papal office, and Adrian becomes aware of his position from
the sound of his voice. 

	|131-132.  vostra~: the plural is used to express respect
for his dignity; before he was aware of this Dante had used
^tua~, l. 93; see note on Purg. xxxiii. 92.  |dritto, &c.~:
`stung me with remorse for standing upright.' 

	|135.  con gli altri~: `with thy brethren'; the passage here
is imitated from Rev. xix. 10, `I am a fellow-servant with thee
and with thy brethren,' &c. 

	|136-137.  evangelico suono~: `utterance of the gospel.' 
|Neque nubent~: this is our Lord's answer to the Sadducees 
concerning the souls after the resurrection Matt. xxii. 30.  What
is there said with regard to the relation of married persons, is
applied here by Adrian in a more general sense; `after death,' he
would say, `all earthly distinctions cease.'  Perhaps, however, 
there is an additional and more special meaning, referring to the
pope being the spouse of the Church, as in Purg. xxiv. 22; so
that he means to say that his sacred office was now at an end. 

	|140-141.  la tua stanza~: `thy staying here.' |ci@o che 
tu dicesti~: cp. ll. 91, 92. 

	|142.  Alagia~ = this Alagia de' Fieschi married Moroello 
Malaspina, on whom see note on Inf. xxiv. 145.  She is mentioned
in answer to Dante's question in ll. 95, 96, which is an offer to
obtain for Adrian the intercession of those on earth. 

	|145.  questa sola, &c.~: this means, not that she was his
only surviving relation, but that, the rest being wicked, she 
was the only one whose prayers would avail for him.
