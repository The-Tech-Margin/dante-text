	|1.  Gi@a~: they had now entered the passage which leads up
from the fifth to the sixth Cornice, passing the Angel who guards
the approach to it. 

	|2, 3.  volti~: `directed'; cp. Purg. vii. 86.  |un colpo~:
one of the `strokes' or marks formed by the P's on Dante's
forehead. 

	|4-6.  E quei, &c.~: `and the Angel had pronounced for us 
those to be blessed whose desires are fixed on righteousness, and
his words completed that saying with the expression "who thirst,"
adding nothing thereto.'  Here, as in other Cornices, as the
travellers pass out, the Angel of the Cornice recites an
appropriate Beatitude to speed them on their way.  In this
instance the complete Beatitude is `Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt
iustitiani,' Matt. v. 6; but as the expression which relates to 
hunger, viz. `qui esuriunt,' is reserved for use in the sixth 
Cornice where gluttony is expiated (Purg. xxv. 151-4), `qui 
sitiunt' alone (|senz' altro~) is used here.  The motto `Beati 
qui sitiunt iustitiam' is appropriate to the Cornice in which 
avarice is expiated, because the thirst for justice is the 
opposite or antidote to the thirst for wealth.  As regards the 
text of this passage, the readings of the Oxford Text, viz. 
|avea~ in l. 5 and |sitiunt~ in l. 6, have been unhesitatingly 
followed here, though ^avean~ has about the same support from the
MSS. as |avea~, and ^sitio~ predominates enormously, over
|sitiunt~; in fact, |sitiunt~ is almost destitute of MS.
authority.  (On these points, and on the passage generally, see 
Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 405 foll.) With ^avean~ and ^sitio~ 
the meaning of the passage is taken to be -- `and those who have
their desires fixed on justice (i.e. the spirits within this 
Comice) had recited for us the text "Beati quorum tecta sunt 
peccata" (Ps. xxxii. 1), and their voices added thereto "I 
thirst," but no further word.'  On this interpretation ^sitio~ 
may either represent the cry of our Lord on the cross, or may 
express a feeling on the part of the spirits themselves.  But the
objections to this explanation of the passage, and consequently 
to the reading, are insuperable.  (1) |Beati~, as it is used to 
introduce a Beatitude in all the corresponding passages (Purg. 
xii. 110; xv. 38; xvii. 68; xix. 50; xxiv. 151; xxvii. 8), can
hardly be used otherwise here. (2) This Cornice alone would be 
without a Beatitude. (3) In five cases out of the six besides the
present one it is either distinctly stated, or fairly implied, 
that the Beatitude was recited by the Angel: as to the sixth 
instance see note on Purg. xii. 110. (4) ^sitio~ has very little
force, while |sitiunt~ gives exactly the meaning which is needed. 

	|7.  pi@u lieve~: in consequence of the removal of another
P. 

	|10-18.  Virgil here declares that he had ere this time
reciprocated Statius' good will. 

	|12.  Pur che~, &c.: `provided that its flame appear
outwardly,' i.e. if there is outward evidence of the feeling. 

	|14.  juvenale~: Juvenal's date is ^circ.~ 47-130 A.D. 
(Teuffel); consequently he was a contemporary of Statius. 

	|16-17.  quale~, &c.: `as great as ever held a man for 
one whom lie had not seen.' 

	|20.  sicurt@a~: `confidence.' 

	|24.  per tua cura~: `by thy diligence,' i.e. long 
continued study. 

	|28-30.  Veramente~, &c.: `Verily things often present 
themselves to us, which furnish subjects for doubt which are 
untrue owing to the true causes being concealed.'  His being 
found in the company of the avaricious suggested the erroneous 
idea that he had committed that sin, whereas the real explanation
of his being there was that he had erred by prodigality, and that
these two sins were punished together. 

	|31.  tuo creder~, &c.: `proves to me that it is your 
belief.' 

	|34.  fu partita~, &c.: `was removed too far from me,' i.e. 
that he erred in the opposite extreme of prodigality.  From the
example of Statius we learn, that in Purgatory the vices of
avarice and prodigality are punished together, as they are in the
fourth Circle of the Inferno.  As has already been intimated in 
the note to Purg. xxi. 10, there appears to be no historical 
groundwork to the story of Statius' prodigality; in fact Juvenal
(vii. 86, 87) implies that he was a needy man, so that he could 
not have had much money to spend. 

	|36.  Migliaia~, &c.: `thousands of revolutions of the 
moon'; as Statius has said in Purg. xxi. 68 that he had been 500
years in Cornice V, the exact number here intended is 6,000 
months. 

	|37-39.  drizzai mia cura~: `rectified my views of life.' 
|intesi l@a~: `pondered on that passage.' |Crucciato~:
`indignant.' 

	|40-41.  Per che~, &c.: the passage in Virgil which these
lines are intended to represent is ^Aen.~ iii. 56, 57, `Quid non
mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra fames?' (`To what crimes dost
thou not compel the hearts of men, accursed lust of gold?')  No
explanation of Dante's rendering of this which is wholly
satisfactory has yet been given.  Perhaps the following is the
best: -- `Through what a course of wickedness dost thou not 
lead the desires of men, accursed lust of gold?'  |Sacra~ in this
case must be regarded as the Latin word borrowed from Virgil's 
original, for ^sacro~ does not bear the sense of `accursed, in 
Italian.  It is a ^prima facie~ objection to this interpretation 
-- in fact to the introduction of the passage of Virgil in its 
proper sense at all -- that it denounces avarice, while Statius 
is denouncing prodigality; but to this it may perhaps be replied,
that the desire of wealth is an accompaniment of prodigality as 
well as of avarice.  Others think that Dante misunderstood 
Virgil's meaning, and take |reggi~ in the sense of `restrain,' 
and |sacra~ as signifying `holy,' `righteous,' `temperate'; so 
that the passage is to be understood, not as denouncing greed of
wealth, but as advocating moderation in its use -- `Why dost thou
not restrain the desires of mortals, O temperate hunger for
gold?' 

	|42.  Voltando~, &c.: `rolling the weights I should be 
experiencing the dismal jousts': the reference is to the 
punishment of the avaricious and the prodigal in Hell, who roll 
forward heavy weights, with which they charge against one 
another.  The words ^voltando pesi~ and ^giostra~ occur in that 
connexion in Inf. vii. 27, 35. 

	|46-48.  scemi~: `shorn'; cp. ^mozzi~ in Inf. vii. 57.  The
reference is to the Italian proverb concerning spendthrifts,
`Egli ha dissipato fino a' capegli.'  |Per ignoranza~, &c.: `from
ignorance (of the sinfulness of prodigality), which prevents 
repentance for this sin during men's lifetime and at their last 
hour.' 

	|49-51.  che rimbecca~, &c.: `which rebuts by direct 
opposition, i.e. is the direct opposite of.  |suo verde secca~: 
`dries its green rankness,' i.e. reduces its superfluity, and 
so returns to the mean. 

	|54.  Per lo~, &c.: `this has befallen me owing to its 
opposite.' 

	|55-57.  cantasti~, &c.: Statius in his ^Thebaid~ related 
the story of `the merciless war of the twofold affliction of 
Jocasta,' i.e. the war between Polynices and Eteocles, the twin 
sons of Jocasta, who are called her `affliction' on account of 
their incestuous birth.  |bucolici~: Virgil is here spoken of as
the `singer of the bucolic strains,' because reference is about 
to be made in l. 70 to his fourth Bucolic or Eclogue. 

	|58-59.  Per quello~, &c.: `from the evidence furnished by
the matter of your poem,' lit. `to judge. from that which you 
by Clio's aid deal with there.'  ^Tastare~ means `to touch,' 
`treat of, `deal with.' |fedele~: `a true believer.' 

	|61-63.  qual sole o quai candele~: `what light from heaven
or earth.'  |diretro~, &c.: `in the wake of the fisherman,' i.e.
St.  Peter -- `the pilot of the Galilean lake.' 

	|65-66.  grotte~: `grots,' `caves,' which are frequently 
associated with sacred sources.  Probably in this instance Dante
was thinking of Castalia, though that spring does not issue from
a cavern.  |appresso Dio~: `next after God.' 

	|67.  quei~: the servant, who walks before his master and
lights him on his way. 

	|70-72.  dicesti~, &c.: Virg. ^Ecl.~ iv. 5-7, `Magnus ab 
integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.  Iam redit et Virgo, redeunt 
Satumia regna; Iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.'  The 
fourth Eclogue was generally regarded during the middle ages as a
prophecy of the birth of Christ. 

	|73-75.  cristiano~: see note on Purg. xxi. 10.  |mei~: for
^meglio~; more commonly written ^me'.~  |disegno~: `sketch,' in
contrast with |colorare~, `to fill in in colour.' 

	|80.  Si consonava~: `in sooth was in harmony with'; ^Si 
consonava~ is also read. 

	|82.  Vennermi~, &c.: lit. `they came to appear to me'; 
where used in this way with the gerund, ^venire~ is almost 
redundant, but it usually implies duration: cp. Par. xxiii. 18,
`venir rischiarando.' 

	|85-87.  mentre~, &c.: `throughout the time that I remained
on earth.'  |sette~: `schools,' of philosophy or religion. 

	|88-89.  pria, &c.~: `before I described in poetry the 
arrival of the Argives (|i Greci~), who came to support
Polynices, at Thebes'; i.e. before I reached the latter part of 
the poem (Book IX), in which their arrival is narrated.  |flumi~:
by these Dante probably means the Isnienus and the Asopus; see 
note on Purg. xviii. 91-3. 

	|90-93.  chiuso~: `concealed.'  |mostrando~: `professing.' 
|il quarto cerchio~: the Circle or Cornice in which lukewarmness
or spiritual sloth was expiated.  |al quarto centesmo~: `for 400
years.' 

	|94-95.  che levato, &c.~: `who (by thy prophetic verses)
hast lifted the veil, which hid from me all that great blessing
of which I speak,' i.e. the Christian faith. 

	|96.  Mentre che~, &c.: `during the remainder of our 
ascent'; |soperchio~ means `that which remains over.'  This 
clause is to be taken with what follows. 

	|97-99.  nostro antico~: `our early poet.'  |Cecilio~: 
Caecilius, the writer of comedies, is mentioned among popular 
Roman poets in two passages of Horace, viz. ^Epist.~ ii. 1. 58, 
59, and ^Ars Poet.~ 54, 55; in the former in conjunction with 
Plautus and Terence, in the latter with Plautus, Virgil, and 
Varius.  Dante seems to have had one or both of these passages in
his mind.  |Varro~: it is not certain whether Dante here means 
Varro Reatinus, who was famous in antiquity for his great 
learning, or Varro Atacinus the poet.  As the other writers who 
are here mentioned were poets, we should expect the latter to be
meant, but it is doubtful whether Dante had heard of him.  His 
name occurs in Horace, ^Sat.~ i. 10. 46, but Dante does not seem
to have been acquainted with the ^Satires.~ On the other hand, he
must have known Varro Reatinus, because that author is spoken of
at some length and with high praise by St. Augustine (^De Civ. 
Dei~, vi. 2 foll.); at the same time, though he wrote satires, he
was comparatively little known as a poet.  Some would prefer to 
read ^Vario~ here, but there is hardly any MS. authority for the
reading.  |vico~: `region,' lit. `alley,' `quarter'; the word is
used for the sake of the rhyme as an equivalent of ^cerchio.~ 

	|101.   quel Greco~: Homer. 

	|104-105.  monte~: both Parnassus and Helicon were sacred to
the Muses (|le nutrici nostre~), but since in Purg. xxix. 37-42
Helicon is introduced in connexion with them, it is probably the
mountain which Dante means here. 

	|106-107.  Antifonte~: both Antiphon and Agathon were tragic
poets. 

	|109-111.  genti tue~: `thy folk,' i.e. the personages who
are introduced in your poems.  For the use of |genti~ plur. in
the sense of `people' cp. `le perdute genti' of Purg. xxx. 138,
which is the equivalent of `la perduta gente' of Inf. iii. 3. 
|Deifille~, &c.: Deiphile and Argea were daughters of Adrastus,
the former of whom was married to Tydeus, one of the Seven
against Thebes, the latter to Polynices.  |si trista~: the life
of Ismene was one of almost unbroken sorrow. 

	|112-114.  quella, &c.~: Hypsipyle, who is mentioned by 
Statius (^Theb.~ iv. 716 foll.) as having shown the spring of 
Langia near Nemea to Adrastus and his army, when they were on 
their way to Thebes, and were distressed by want of water.  |la 
figlia di Tiresia~: Manto (Stat., ^Theb.~ iv. 463 foll.), whom 
Dante in Inf. xx. 55 places among the soothsayers in Malebolge. 
This is an oversight on the Poet's part.  |Teti~, &c.: Thetis, 
the mother of Achilles, and Deidamia, the object of his early 
love, are often mentioned in the ^Achilleid.~  The description of
the latter in the company of her sisters (|con le suore sue~) 
occurs in ^Achill.~ i. 285-96. 

	|117.  Liberi, &c.~: they were now emerging from the passage
on to the sixth Cornice.  Here (1) the sin punished is gluttony;
(2) the punishment is the sight of trees laden with fruit and
sprinkled with fresh water, of which the sinners may not partake;
(3) the examples of the virtue of temperance are the Blessed
Virgin; ancient Roman women; Daniel; the Golden Age; St. John the
Baptist; (4) the examples of the vice are the Centaurs; the
companions of Gideon; (5) they are presented by a voice from 
the branches of the mystic trees; (6) the passage from a Church 
Office is ^Labia mea, Domine~; (7) the Beatitude is ^Beati qui 
esuriunt.~ 

	|118-120.  ancelle del giorno~: for the use of this 
expression in the sense of `hours' cp. Purg. xii. 81; `four hours
of the day had now passed.'  |la quinta, &c.~: `the fifth hour
was at the pole of the sun's car (i.e. was leading on the day), 
directing ever upwards its blazing point.'  As the sun was 
regarded as mounting the sky until noon, the pole of its chariot
would be conceived of as pointing upwards.  Since the day
commenced at 6 a.m., the time here intended would be between 10
and 11 a.m.  The day was Easter Tuesday, the 12th of April. 

	|121-123.  allo estremo, &c.~: `towards the outer side of 
the Cornice.'  By turning their right side towards this, and then
walking on, they would be taking the direction to the right hand
along the Mountain, which they had hitherto followed. 

	|130-131.  ragioni~: `discourse'; cp. Purg. xiv. 126.  |un
arbor~: this tree is regarded as having sprung from the Tree of
Life, in the same way as the corresponding tree which is
mentioned below (Purg. xxiv. 116, 117) sprang from the Tree of 
Knowledge, in the Garden of Eden (Gen. ii. 9).  The trees in this
Cornice torment the souls which look at them from beneath by 
holding their fruit beyond their reach. 

	|133.  si digrada~: `tapers'; the fir-tree is broad below 
and narrows upwards, while this tree is broad at the top and 
narrows downwards. 

	|136.  Dal lato~, &c.: `on the side towards which our 
road was enclosed,' i.e. the side towards the Mountain; while 
that towards the precipice was open. 

	|141.  caro~: for ^carestia~, `dearth,' `lack.' 

	|142-144.  disse~: the voice from the mystic tree here 
proclaims the examples of the virtue of temperance, which is the
opposite of the vice of gluttony.  As in the other Cornices, so 
here, the Scriptural and classical examples alternate with one 
another.  |Maria~: at the marriage at Cana of Galilee, when she 
said `they have no wine,' John ii. 3.  |risponde~: `intercedes.' 

	|145-147.  le Romane, &c.~: this statement is found in Val.
Max. ii. 1. 5, who says `Vini usus olim Romanis feminis ignotus
fuit'; but probably Dante got it from Aquinas, ^Summa~, ii.
2+dae~ Q. 149. Art. iv, `Secundum Valerium Maximum mulieres apud
Romanos antiquitus non bibebant vinum.' |Daniello~: see Dan. i.
11, 12, `Daniel said to the steward...let them give us pulse to
eat and water to drink,' and God gave him `knowledge and skill 
in all learning and wisdom,' v. 17. 

	|148-150.  quant' oro~, &c.: `was as fair as gold,' i.e. it
was the Golden Age.  |le ghiande~, &c.: probably Dante was
thinking of Ovid, ^Met.~ i. 104, 106, Arbuteos fetus montanaque 
fraga legebant...Et quae deciderant patula Iovis arbore 
glandes,' and l. 111, `iam flumina nectaris ibant.' 

	|154.  l' Evangelio~: Matt. xi. 11 `Verily I say unto you,
Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater
than John the Baptist.'
