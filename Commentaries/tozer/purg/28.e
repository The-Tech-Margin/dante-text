	|4.  la riva~: the `bank' is the outer edge of the
Terrestrial Paradise, which they had reached on mounting the 
topmost step of the stairway; Purg. xxvii. 125. 

	|7.  senza~, &c.: it came steadily from the same quarter and
with equal force. 

	|10-12.  pronte~: `responsively,' the leaves being ready to
follow the movement of the wind.  |piegavano~: here used intrans. 
|alla parte~, &c.: towards the west; as the wind which swayed
them blew in Dante's face (l. 8), and he was facing eastward
(Purg. xxvii.  133), is must have come from the east.  The cause
of the direction of the wind is given in ll. 103 foll. 

	|13-15.  Non per@o~, &c.: `yet they were not swayed so far
from their upright position, that the birds on their summits must
fain cease from fulfilling any of their tasks,' i.e. from song 
and joyful movement. 

	|16-19.  l' #ore prime...ricevi@eno~: `breathed the morning
breeze'; |#ore~ for ^aure~, cp. Purg. i. 115.  It is better
however to read ^ore~ (`welcomed the hours of morn'), because the
breeze of morn, as such, would not be found in the Terrestrial
Paradise, since the movement of the wind there was always even. 
|tenevan bordone~, &c.: `were chanting a refrain' (i.e. making an
accompaniment) to their lays, like that of the whispering
pine-forest (|Tal qual~, &c.).'  The word |bordone~ means
originally a droning sound, and the bass in music: see Skeat,
s.v. `burden.' 

	|20-21.  Chiassi~: the famous pine-forest of Classe lies on
the coast of the Adriatic to the southward of Ravenna.  |Quand'
Eolo~, &c.: `when Aeolus (the guardian of the winds; cp. Virg. 
^Aen.~ i. 52) sets free the south-east wind.'  The winds,
according to classical mythology, were imprisoned in a cavern in
the Aeolian islands. 

	|25-26.  un rio~: this is Lethe, the river of forgetfulness,
which extinguishes in the mind the memory of past sin; cp. l.
128.  In Inf. xiv. Virgil, when describing to Dante the courses
of the rivers in Hell, informs him (ll. 136-8) that Lethe, which
Dante knew by means of the classical writers as one of the
infernal rivers, would be met with on the Mountain of Purgatory. 
|inver sinistra~: as the course of the Poets was towards the
east, the river which here interposed must have been running in
this part from south to north.  The words |inver sinistra~ may
possibly have an allegorical force, with reference to the memory
of evil being carried away by Lethe;, but this view rests on
somewhat slippery ground, beciuse we are told in Purg. xxix. 11,
12 that the stream had previously flowed at right angles to this. 

	|30.  nulla nasconde~: `hides nothing,' i.e. is perfectly
transparent. 

	|36.  mai~: `green branches'; strictly ^maio~ is the
laburnum tree. 

	|40.  Una Donna~: this lady's name, as we learn from Purg. 
xxxiii. 119, is Matelda; she represents the active life, as Leah
had done in Dante's dream.  She is generally regarded as being
Matilda, the `Great Countess' of Tuscany (1046-1115), who was a
strong upholder of her own rights, and also of those of the 
Papacy, having been the ally of Pope Gregory VII in his warfare 
with the Empire.  She would thus be a fitting person to represent
the life of action.  The function discharged by Matelda in the 
^Div. Com.~ is that of guiding and instructing Dante from the 
time when Virgil ceases to perform that office until Beatrice 
undertakes it.  She thus leads Dante to Beatrice, as the active 
life leads up to the contemplative. 

	|41.  iscegliendo~, &c.: `making choice among the flowers.' 

	|43-45.  amore~: tile love of God is meant.  |Ti scaldi~:
`dost bask.'  |testimon~: for ^testimone~, `a witness,' which
word is found in Petrarch, Boccaccio, and elsewhere; see ^Vocab. 
Tramater.~ 

	|49-51.  dove~, &c.: Proserpine, the daughter of Ceres
(Demeter), was gathering flowers in the valley of Enna in Sicily,
when she was carried off by Pluto.  |primavera~: the flowers 
which she had gathered; ^primavera~ is used again in the sense of
`flowers' in Par. xxx. 63, `Dipinte di mirabil primavera.'  That
this is the meaning here is rendered almost certain by the 
passage in Ovid, which Dante evidently had in his mind when 
writing this -- ^Met.~ v. 397-9, `Matrem saepius ore Clamat; et,
ut summa vestem laniarat ab orae Collecti flores tunicis cecidere
remissis.' 

	|52-53.  strette~, &c.: `close to the ground and close to
one another.' 

	|59-60.  Si appressando s@e~, &c.: at first he heard only
the melody, but as she came near he distinguished the words also.

	|61-63.  l@a dove~, &c.: `where the grass is now laved'; 
|gi@a~ marks the point where a person approaching reaches the 
edge.  |mi fece dono~: `granted me the boon'; cp. Inf. vi. 78. 

	|64-66.  Non credo~, &c.: the story of Venus being
accidentally wounded by one of Cupid's arrows, and fired by 
passionate love for Adonis in consequence, is found in Ovid 
^Met.~ x. 525, 526, `Namque pharetratus dum dat puer oscula 
matri, Inscius exstanti destrinxit arundine pectus.'  |fuor,
&c.~: `by no means with his wonted aim,' lit. `differently from
what he was ever wont'; he did it inadvertently (this Ovid
expresses by ^Inscius~), whereas Cupid's darts were not wont to
fly astray. 

	|67-69.  dritta~: take with |riva~, `from the farther bank,
which was the right bank'; if |dritta~ is taken as agreeing with
|Ella~, meaning `erect,' then for |Traendo~ in the next line
^Trattando~, `handling' (i.e. twining), must be read, for in 
gathering flowers Matelda could not be upright.  Three of Witte's
test MSS. read ^Trattando.~  |Traendo pi@u color~: `continuing to
gather flowers'; |pi@u~ means `additional to what she had 
gathered before,' cp. l. 41.  With ^Trattando~ it must mean 
`many,' as in Par. xxv. 3,' per pi@u anni.'  |Che~, &c.: `which 
that high land produces without seed'; this is explained in ll. 
112-4; at the same time Dante probably had in his mind Ov. ^Met.~ 
i. 108, `natos sine semine flores,' for Ovid's description of the
golden age in which this occurs was familiar to him. 

	|72.  Freno~: the Hellespont is a `curb' to human pride, 
because it witnessed both the passage of Xerxes' army and his own
miserable flight.  Dante refers to this again in ^De Mon.~ ii. 9. 
ll. 49-60, where he quotes Lucan, ^Phars.~ ii. 672, 673, which
was probably his authority for the story. 

	|73-74.  da Leandro~: because it interposed between him and
Hero; Ov. ^Heroid.~ xviii. 173, 174.  |Per mareggiare~: `by
reason of its current.' 

	|78-80.  nido~: `home,' the Garden of Eden having been the
abode of our first parents.  |sospetto~: `questioning'; in the
following line Matelda explains the reason of her smiles by
referring to Ps. xcii. 4, `Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through
thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.'  Her joy was
in the forest and the flowers. 

	|82-84.  dinanzi~: from the time that Virgil had withdrawn 
from his office as guide (Purg. xxvii. 139) Dante had walked in 
front of the other two poets.  |tanto che basti~: `to your 
satisfaction.' 

	|87.  cosa~: this is the statement of Starius in Purg. xxi.
43 and 52-4, to the effect that there was no change, atmospheric
or otherwise, above the gate at the entrance to Purgatory proper. 
This would seem to exclude the movement of the wind which sways
the trees, and the flow of the water. 

	|88-90.  come procede~, &c.: lit. `how that comes to pass in
respect of its cause,' i.e. what is the cause of that.  |la
nebbia~, &c.: `the cloud of doubt that assails thee.' 

	|91.  esso~: here used in the proper sense of the Lat.
^ipse~, `himself.' 

	|97-100.  il turbar~, &c.: `the disturbances (arising from
winds), which below the entrance to Purgatory proper (|sotto~)
are caused by exhalations from the water and the earth through
their natural force (|da s@e~).'  This is from Ar. ^Meteorol.~
ii. 4. 13; see Moore, ^Studies.~ i. p. 131.  |Che, quanto
posson~, &c.: `which (exhalations) follow the heat (upwards) as
far as they can.'  Aristotle in the passage just mentioned speaks
of the heat ascending and leaving the moisture behind (Muore,
ibid.): |quanto posson~ refers to the ascent of the vapours being
checked, either by reaching a colder stratum of air or by some
other influence, like that which excludes them from Purgatory. 
|All' uomo~, &c.: `might not in any wise disquiet man,' i.e. man
in his innocence, when he inhabited the Terrestrial Paradise. 

	|102.  libero~, &c.: `it is free from such disturbance from
the point where it is locked,' i.e. from the gate of Purgatory. 

	|103-108.  Or~, &c.: Matelda now proceeds to explain the 
existence of the wind which moves the trees in the Terrestrial 
Paradise.  This she attributes to the movement of the atmosphere,
which revolves (|si volge in circuito~), following the motion 
initiated by the ^Primum Mobile~ or first sphere of movement (|la
prima volta~), and imparted by it to the whole universe.  As the
earth is stationary, this movement causes a steady breeze to be
felt in an elevated region like the Terrestrial Paradise, which
is not affected by the currents of air which move irregularly
below. 

	|105.  Se non~, &c.: `unless its rotatory movement is 
interfered with at some point.' 

	|106-108.  disciolta~, &c.: `disengaged in the clear air.' 
|percote~: take with |la selva~ below. 

	|109-120.~  These lines explain the propagation of various 
kinds of trees on the face of the earth from those planted by God
in the Terrestrial Paradise. 

	|111.  girando~, &c.: `scatters it (|sua virtute~) as it 
revolves round the globe.' 

	|112-114.  l' altra terra~: the earth at large as
distinguished from the Terrestrial Paradise.  |degna~, &c.:
`fitted to receive these germinal forces in respect of soil (|per
s@e~) and climate (|per suo ciel).'  |concepe~, &c.: `conceives
and bears from divers germinal forces divers trees.' 

	|115.  di l@a~: `in yonder earth.' 

	|120.  si schianta~: `is plucked,' `gathered.' 

	|121.  L' acqua~, &c.: Matelda now turns to Dante's other 
difficulty, the existence of a river where there was no rain to 
feed it. 

	|122-123.  Che ristori~, &c.: this seems to refer both to
the formation of rain by condensation. which has already been 
described in Purg. v. 109-11, and to Aristotle's theory of the 
formation of springs by the condensation of subterranean
moisture, ^Meteorol.~ i. 13. 9: %epsilon%iota%pi%epsilon%sigma\ 
%kappa%alpha%kappa%epsilon%iota\ [i.e. in the air]
%delta%iota%alpha\ %psi%upsilon%chi%rho%o%tau%eta%tau%alpha\ 
%sigma%upsilon%nu%iota%sigma%tau%alpha%tau%alpha%iota\ %o\ 
%alpha%tau%mu%iota%zeta%omega%nu\ %alpha%eta%rho\ 
%epsilon%iota%varsigma\ %upsilon%delta%omega%rho\, 
%kappa%alpha%iota\ %upsilon%pi%o\ %tau%eta g%o%varsigma\.  See
Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 14.  |lena~: `volume,' lit. `breath,'
`force.' 

	|124-126.  fontana~: the idea here is derived from Gen. ii. 
6, where the Vulg. gives `fons ascendebat e terra,' while the 
Engl. Vers. is `there went up a mist from the earth.'  |salda~: 
`steady.'  |Che tanto~, &c.: `which by the agency of God's will
is supplied afresh with the same quantity which it pours forth 
opening in two directions.' 

	|128-129.  altrui~: `from men'; cp. Purg. iv. 54; xiii. 3. 
|la~: i.e. ^la memoria.~ 

	|131-132.  Euno@e~: the stream of `kindly thoughts,' Gk. 
%epsilon%upsilon%nu%o%upsilon%varsigma\.  |chiama~: this word 
seems here to be metrically a trisyllable, though it is not used
so elsewhere in the ^Div. Com.~  |non adopra~: `it does not 
produce its effect'; the subject of the verb is ^acqua~, l. 121,
and the meaning is, that it does not render the soul fit to
ascend to Heaven until the conscience of past sins has been 
removed, and the memory of good deeds has been revived. 

	|135.  perch@e~: `supposing that,' `even if.' 

	|136-138.  corollario~: `corollary,' i.e. a deduction, or 
supplementary statement.  |per grazia~: `of grace'; it is really
equivalent to |oltre promission~ below, Matelda having fulfilled
her agreement by answering Dante's questions.  |si spazia~:
`widens its field'; cp. Purg. xxvi. 63. 

	|141.  in Parnaso~: `to dream on Parnassus' means in prose
`to conceive poetical imaginations.'  Dante does not appear 
to have been acquainted with Persius' writings, otherwise we 
might suppose that he was thinking of his line (^Prol.~ 2), `Nec
in bicipiti somniasse Parnasso.' 

	|142-144.  Qui fu~, &c.: this description of the Golden Age
is chiefly derived fiom Ov. ^Met.~ i. 89-112, where there is 
mention in particular of `ver aeternum' and `flumina nectaris.' 

	|146-147.  con riso~: because they were in the number of 
the `ancient poets,' and were pleased by this interpretation. 
|el' ultimo costrutto~: `the last sentence.'
