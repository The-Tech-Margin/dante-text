	|I-3.  Buio~: here used as a subst.; `darkness of Hell, or
of night, when night is bereft of every planet beneath a barren
sky (lit. a sky impoverished of stars), overcast to the utmost by
clouds.' The symbolism seems to be, that anger, which is `a brief
madness,' clouds the judgement and obscures the conscience, in
the same way as smoke takes away the power of sight.  Smoke,
moreover, like anger, is harsh and irritating. 

	|6.  N@e a sentir~, &c.: `nor did the darkness ever make to
my sight a veil of so hard texture to feel.' 

	|8.  saputa~: `sagacious,' like ^savio~, `sage,' the 
familiar epithet of Virgil, only |saputa~ has the sense of 
practical wisdom. 

	|1.  mozzo~: `separated'; lit. `cut off.' 

	|17.  per pace~, &c.: in the ^Agnus Dei~, which these
spirits were singing, the bestowal of peace and mercy is the 
burden of the prayer -- `Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, 
miserere nobis.  Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, da nobis 
pacem.'  The English of these words is familiar in our Litany. 

	|20-21.  Una parola~, &c.: `all used the same words and the
same tone'; the `concord' thus produced is contrasted with the
discord arising from anger. 

	|24.  solvendo il nodo~: `untying the knot'; freeing
themselves from the bondage of the sin of anger, which keeps them
from ascending to heaven. 

	|25-27.  fendi~: `passest through.'  |pur, come se~, &c.: 
`just as if thou wert not one of us, but wert in the number of 
the living'; lit. `as if thou didst still divide (measure) time 
by calends,' as men do on earth.  The Roman calends, as being the
first day of every month, are here taken as a specimen division 
of time -- `by such time-marks as calends.'  The form |calendi~ 
for ^calende~ is found also in Boccaccio and other writers. 

	|30.  si va sue~: `is the passage upward' to the next
Cornice. 

	|34-36.  quanto mi lece~: we see from Purg. xv. 142 that 
the smoke did not extend over the entire Cornice; consequently 
the spirits who were undergoing penance were confined within 
certain limits.  |in quella vece~: `instead thereof,' i.e. of 
seeing; cp. Inf. xxi. 10. 

	|37-39.  fascia~: `swathing band' (Longf.), i.e. the body or
outer man, which enwraps the soul.  |la infernale ambascia~: `the
anguish of Hell'; this is shown to be the meaning by the use of
the same expression in this sense in Par. xxvi. 133. 

	|40-42.  se~: `inasmuch as'; but the conditional particle 
puts the statement more modestly.  |richiuso~: `enfolded,' 
`embraced me in his grace'; cp. Par. ix. 102.  |fuor~, &c.: 
`unwonted in these latter days'; subsequently to St. Paul no 
living person had been carried up to heaven. 

	|44-45.  varco~: `passage.' |tue parole~, &c.: i.e. the
sound of your voice will guide us through the darkness of the 
smoke. 

	|46.  Lombardo~: `a Lombard.'  Benvenuto says that he was 
called a Lombard because he was intimate with the leading men of
his time in Lombardy.  Little is known of this Marco, but he is 
said to have been a Venetian nobleman of the second half of Cent.
xiii, who was learned and courteous. 

	|47-48.  valore~: `worth,' `nobility of character.' 
|disteso~: `unbent'; `at which men now neglect to aim.' 

	|51.  su~: in Heaven. 

	|55-57.  Prima~, &c.: the question (|dubbio~) in Dante's 
mind was concerning the cause of the deep-seated corruption of 
his age.  This question first suggested itself when Guido del 
Duca affirmed the existence of that corruption (Purg. xiv. 37, 
38, `Virt@u cos@i per nemica si fuga Da tutti'), and so far it 
had only a single or simple force (|era scempio~), because it 
started from the statement of a single person; but its force was
doubled (|fatto doppio~), when the existence of that corruption 
was asserted by Marco also (|Nella sentenza tua~), for the 
repetition of the statement caused Dante to feel certain of the 
fact from which the question originated in his mind (|quello ov' 
io l' accoppio~).  |Qui ed altrove~: `comparing the present with 
the former statement' (Marco's with Guido del Duca's).  |quello~,
&c.: lit. `that to which I attach the question.' 

	|59-60.  suone~: for ^suoni~, `dost declare'; cp. ll. 47,
48.  |di malizia~, &c.: `big with malice and overshadowed by it.'

	|63.  nel ciel~, &c.: Guido del Duca had already suggested
that in the formation of men's characters two powers were at
work, viz. divine appointment and human freewill, when he said
that the corruption of the inhabitants of the Arno valley was
caused `o per sventura Del loco, o per mal uso che li fruga,'
Purg. xiv. 38, 39.  In the present passage the same thing 
is affirmed but it is more definitely stated that the agency 
through which the divine appointment works is the influence of 
the planetary spheres (|il cielo~).  By these the order of nature
is determined, and the characters and fortunes of men are 
variously affected.  This doctrine is concisely declared in Purg.
xxx. 109-11, and is more fully set forth, together with an
account of the Angels or Intelligences who direct these spheres,
in Par. ii. 112 foll.  The point in connexion with it which is 
now insisted on is, that notwithstanding these influences the 
will of man is free, and he is a responsible agent. 

	|64.  strinse in `hui'~: `forced into a cry.' 

	|68.  cosi come~ se:`just as if.' 

	|71-72.  non fora~, &c.: i.e. in that case there would be no
justice in a system of rewards and punishments. 

	|73-75.  Lo cielo~, &c.: `the planets originate in the soul
some at least of the impulses which move it.'  |Lume~, &c.: 
`light is given you (in reason and conscience, independent of 
planetary influences) to teach you right and wrong.' 

	|76-78.  se fatica~, &c.: `though it has to endure fatigue 
in its first encounters with the planetary influences (i.e. the 
conditions imposed by them), in the end wins a complete victory.'
For the construction in |vince tutto~ cp. Inf. viii. 122,
`vincer@o la prova.' 

	|79-81.  A maggior~, &c.: `it is to a higher power and a 
better nature than that of the spheres (i.e. to the power and 
nature of God) that ye are subject, though still free; and this 
it is which creates the mind in you, which the spheres do not 
control.' 

	|82-84.  disvia~: `goes astray'; this is in answer to 
Dante,s question in ll. 58 foll.  |si cheggia~: `let the cause be
sought.'  |vera spia~: `a faithful pioneer,' to explain the 
matter.

	|85~ foll.  Marco, having combated the view that the
planetary influences destroy man's freewill and his
responsibility, proceeds to show the real cause of the prevailing
corruption.  The soul, he says, when it leaves its Creator's 
hands, naturally seeks after what pleases it, and is liable to be
misled unless it is guided and restrained; hence arises the need
of laws, and of one to administer them.  But at the present time
the laws are in abeyance owing to the paralysis of government 
arising from the spiritual power having appropriated the temporal
power, and itself showing a bad example. 

	|85-86.  la vagheggia~, &c.: `contemplates it lovingly
before it is created'; the idea of it has existed from the first
in the Creator's mind.  The view of the origin of the soul which
is here given is that of Creationism -- according to which it 
proceeds directly from God -- as against that of Traducianism, 
which regards it as being inherited from the parents. 

	|91.  picciol bene~: paltry enjoyments. 

	|96.  Della vera cittade~: i.e. of the city of God; cp.
Purg. xiii. 95.  |la torre~: the bulwark or tower of defence
which the ruler is to have in view is justice; cp. ^De Mon.~ i. 
1-3. ll. 54-7, where Dante says of the Monarch, `ipse vel omnino,
vel maxime bene dispositus ad regendum esse potest, quia inter
caeteros iudicium et iustitiam potissime habere potest.' 

	|97-98.  pon mano ad esse~: `administers them.'  |precede~:
`goes before the flock.' 

	|99.  Ruminar~, &c.: the terms here used refer to the tests
by which beasts were determined to be clean under the Mosaic law,
viz. that they should chew the cud and divide the hoof (Lev. xi.
3).  As applied to the Heads of the Church, the allegorical
meaning of `chewing the cud' seems to be the acquisition of
wisdom by pondering on sources of knowledge; but in respect of
`dividing the hoof' the symbolism is twofold, as is shown by tbe
use which the Poet makes of it in two separate passages.  First,
it signifies the practice of good morals, in accordance with what
St. Augustine says -- `Fissa enim ungula ad mores, ruminatio vero
ad sapientiam pertinet.  Quare ad mores fissa ungula?  Quia
difficile labitur' (^Serm.~ cxlix. 3. 4); and it is applied in
this sense in ll. 100-5, where it is explained that it was the
unprincipled conduct of the Roman Court which had demoralized the
world.  Secondly, the dividing of the hoof represents the
separation of the temporal and spiritual powers, which principle
the popes had ignored.  This interpretation is found in ll.
127-9, where the Church of Rome is spoken of as a beast of
burden, which falls in the mud in consequence of its not
distinguishing between these two spheres of government, the 
reference obviously being to the support given to such animals in
slippery ground by the divided hoof (see note on ll. 127-9).  The
two allegorical applications are not wholly unconnected with one
another, because it was greed of worldly gains which led to the 
appropriation of the temporal power by the Papacy. 

	|101.  Pure a quel ben ferire~: `aim only at that
advantage.' 

	|103.  mala condotta~: `evil guidance.' 

	|106-107.  il buon mondo feo~: `created the world of good
order,' i.e. originated the good government of the world.  |Due
Soli~: these are the source of temporal guidance in the Empire,
and that of spiritual guidance in the Papacy.  The principle laid
down in this passage is the text of Dante's ^De Monarchia.~ 
Dante here identifies Christian Rome, which |soleva due Soli
aver~, with Pagan Rome, |che il buon mondo feo~; this is due to
his belief in the continuity of the Roman power. 

	|109-111.  L' un~, &c.: `the spiritual power has
extinguished the temporal,' by appropriating it to itself.  |Per
viva forza~: take with |convien~, `must of necessity'; this use 
is illustrated by the corresponding phrase `per viva necessit@a.'

	|112.  Perocch@e~, &c.: while the two powers were in
separate hands, they were restrained from transgression by fear 
of one another; now that they are in the same hands, that fear 
has ceased. 

	|113-114.~  pon |mente~, &c.: `consider the ear of corn, for
the plant is known by its fruits (|lo seme~)'; in other words 
-- `look at the corruption which has arisen from it.'  To 
illustrate this, Marco now adduces the condition of his own 
country, Lombardy. 

	|115-117.  In sul paese~, &c.: `the country irrigated by 
the Adige and the Po' is Lombardy in its widest acceptation, i.e.

the entire plain of Upper Italy.  Observe that both in this line
and the next there is a singular verb with two subjects.  |avesse
briga~: `was involved in strife.'  The evil arising from the
Popes taking up the sword is shown by the ruin that had befallen
Lombardy owing to the conflict between Frederic II and Honorius
III, Gregory IX, and Innocent IV. 

	|118-120.  Or pu@o~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `at the present
time so few good characters are left there, that a man, who from
sense of shame at his own criminality wished to avoid holding
communication with respectable persons, could pass through the
country without fear of doing so (|sicuramente~).'  |indi~: `by
that way.'  |lasciasse~: `has ceased to'; cp. Purg. xiv. 55. 

	|121-123.  en~: for ^enno~ (= ^sono~); cp. Par. xiii. 97. 
|in cui~, &c.: `in whose persons the ancient age reproves the 
modern.'  |par lor tardo~, &c.: `they think it long, ere God 
remove them to a better life.' 

	|124-125.~  The three noblemen here mentioned were of 
Brescia, Treviso, and Reggio respectively.  Little is known of 
them. 

	|126.  Francescamente~: `as the French are wont to do'; he
is said to have been hospitable and helpful to the French who 
passed through his country.  |il semplice Lombardo~: `the
guileless Lombard,' in contrast to the Lombard usurers, from whom
the Rue des Lombards in Paris and Lombard Street in London
obtained their names.  This contrast gives its point to 
|Francescamente.~ 

	|127-129.  oggimai~: `henceforward.'  |la Chiesa~, &c.: the 
Church of Rome is here likened to a beast of burden slipping in 
the mud in consequence of its not dividing the hoof.  The purpose
served by the cloven hoof in the animals that possess it is to 
steady their footsteps in yielding or slippery ground by the 
additional support which is thus given to them.  This is what St.
Augustine means in the passage quoted in note to l. 99, when he 
says, `Fissa ungula....difficile labitur.'  The separation of the
temporal from the spiritual government of the world, and the 
assignment of them to the Emperor and the Pope respectively, is 
compared to the cloven hoof in respect of the safety which it 
affords; but the Church of Rome (the Poet says) by combining in 
its own hands these two spheres of government destroyed this 
safeguard, and so broke down, and brought disgrace both on itself
and on the office which it discharged.  |la soma~: `the burden 
which it carries,' i.e. the work of government which it has taken
upon it. 

	|131-132.  perch@e~, &c.: cp. Deut. xviii. 2, `They (the
tribe of Levi) shall have no inheritance among their brethren'; 
the reason for this injunction, which Dante now perceives, was 
that they might not be entangled in the care of temporalities; 
cp. ^De Mon.~ iii. 14. ll. 29-35. 

	|133-134.  quel che~, &c.: `he who, you say, has remained as
a specimen,' &c. 

	|136-138.  O tuo~, &c.: `you must be either mocking me or 
drawing me on to some further statement,' for it is impossible 
that you have not heard of him, as you come from Tuscany.  This 
implies that Gherardo was well known in that country.  The 
peculiarity of the ^lingua Toscana~ which Marco recognizes in 
Dante's speech was probably in the pronunciation; cp. Inf. x. 25;
xxxiii. 11, 12. 

	|139-140.  Per altro~, &c.: from these lines it appears
that, when in l. 133 Dante professes ignorance about Gherardo, he
must have done so with a definite purpose, viz. in order that his
daughter Gaia might be mentioned as a conspicuous person.  The 
question then arises, for what was she conspicuous? and to this 
there are two opposite answers, for whereas both accounts
represent her as being beautiful, one says that she was 
distinguished for her virtues, the other for her vices.  The 
latter of these is antecedently the more probable, for as Dante 
is here inveighing against the corruption of the age, it would be
to his purpose to mention a descendant of a paragon of virtue who
became notorious for vice. 

	|142.  l' albor~: this white light proceeds from the Angel
who guards the passage to the next Cornice; see Purg. xvii. 47. 

	|144.  L' Angelo @e ivi~: this is a parenthesis.
