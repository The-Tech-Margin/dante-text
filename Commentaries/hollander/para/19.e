	|1-6.~  The Eagle is first seen as a discrete entity ^(la bella image)~
and then as its components, the individual just rulers who constitute
this beautiful image of justice, each appearing as a much-prized
precious stone, the ruby.  The text goes on to suggest that all of them
were glowing as though the sun were equally reflected in all of them at
once (something that would not happen in earthbound optics, where
uneven surfaces reflect a distant light variously).  In fact, these
"rubies," red with the glow of ^caritas~, are shining with their own
light of affection, if that is eventually a reflection of God's love
for them.

Dante's radical (and revolutionary, at least from an Augustinian point
of view) notion is that earthly justice is the direct product of a
divine principle.  And, as we learned in the last canto (see the note
to ^Par~. XVIII.115-117), the souls of the shapers of those human
institutions that serve justice are themselves shaped by the agency of
this heaven.  This offers us another occasion on which to consider
Dante's heterodoxy when he is measured against the requirements of any
one school of thought.  Depending on the specific issues enjoined, he
will be seen to be both Augustinian and anti-Augustinian, Aristotelian
and anti-Aristotelian, Virgilian and anti-Virgilian.  Perhaps that is
one reason that contemporary readers are so surprisingly receptive to
this medieval poet; they "read beneath the radar" of the "official"
Dantologies, which tend, in their strategic attempt to restrict other
views, to make him one thing and only that thing (e.g., Dominican or
Franciscan; imperialist or republican; "grammarian" or vernacularist;
etc.).  He is, as he said his poem was (^Epistle~ XIII.20),
"polysemous" (of many meanings).

	|1.~  The image of the Eagle, with its open wings, suggests, to Zygmunt
Baranski ("^Paradiso~ XIX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
{virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 277), a passage from Deuteronomy 32:11, "expandit
alas suas" (spreading out its wings), in the song about himself that
Moses intones near the end of his life, in which he is presented as an
eagle taking his chicks upon his back for an exodal ride.  (Scartazzini
cited that passage, but at ^Purgatorio~ IX.30.)

	|2.~  The term ^frui~ (to enjoy), first identified as deriving from St.
Augustine by Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-3), probably arrives in Dante
via Aquinas (^ST~ I-II, q. 11, a. 3), as Scartazzini may have been the
first to suggest. Steiner (comm. to vv. 2-3) adverts to the familiar
Augustinian binome (variously found but perhaps best known from the
extended discussion in the first book of ^De doctrina christiana~),
^frui~ and ^uti~ (to use), the former pertaining to our relationship to
things divine (we "enjoy" them), the latter, to perishable things (we
only "use" these).

	|7-12.~  What Dante must now report was never reported by voice, nor
written in ink, nor present in the image-receiving faculty of the mind,
for he had seen the beak speak and had heard it, too, when it uttered
with its voice "I" and "mine," while in its conception it meant "we"
and "our."  We have had a similar experience once before, hearing Dante
introduce himself as "we" and then speak as "I" in the first two lines
of the poem (^Inf~. I.1-2): "Nel mezzo del cammin di ^nostra~ vita /
^mi~ ritrovai per una selva oscura...."

St. Paul describes similar marvelous truths (I Corinthians 2:9) that
"the eye has not seen, nor ear
heard, nor the heart of man imagined," an observation dating back to
Jacopo della Lana (proem to this canto).  For discussion of this
example of Dante's exploitation of the familiar topos of novelty, see
Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002]), pp.
81-82).

	|9.~  For "phantasy" as a technical term in medieval versions of
Aristotelian "physiology of mind," see Carroll (comm. to ^Par~.
IV.28-48) and Singleton (comm. to ^Purg~. XVII.13-18); see also the
note to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.13-18.  This faculty is the image-receiving
element in the mind.  Carroll, Singleton, and Hollander consequently
use this spelling in order to distinguish this term from the modern
one, "fantasy," a daydream or another form of fictive flight.

See Mario Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 85, for two
potential biblical sources for this verse: for ^fantasia~,
Ecclesiasticus 34:6; for ^compreso~, Daniel 7:1, ^comprehendit~, when
Daniel has a dream of a leonine shape with the wings of an eagle (Dan.
7:4).

	|10.~  The first commentator to report the resonance here of Apocalypse
8:13, "Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as
it flew directly overhead," was Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 10-12).  The
context is the fourth angelic trumpet blast, and the eagle is
announcing woe to those who dwell on earth.  Dante's Eagle, on the
other hand, has a more eupeptic message.

It seems clear that Geoffrey Chaucer was amused when he read this
verse; his loquacious eagle in that delightful send-up of Dante's poem,
^The House of Fame~, surely was one poet's laughing salute to another.

	|13.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) point out the resonance of
the description of Trajan (shortly himself to appear in the poem at
^Par~. XX.44-45) in ^Purgatorio~ X.93, where he is portrayed as moved
by ^giustizia~ and ^piet@a~.

	|14-15.~  These verses were initially and widely interpreted to refer
to that glory (salvation) that is greater than any desire for it.
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 15), however, cites Bartolomeo Perazzini
(^Note alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Venice, 1844], p. 155), who says that
the heavenly glory won by these souls, even more than did their desire,
reflected (and rewarded) their deeds.  Given the context of their
virtuous acts as rulers, this interpretation has won support ever since
it was presented by Scartazzini (^op. cit.~) and Campi (comm. to vv.
13-15).  Nonetheless, there is still no consensus, with various
commentators advancing the one or the other explanation.  Here is
Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-18), summarizing the debate before attempting
to find a way out: "Two interpretations are suggested: (1) that this
glory of Jupiter is superior to all human desire; (2) that it does not
allow itself to be won by mere desire -- it must be worked for (Matth.
7:21).  I venture to suggest a third: the common way in which kings aim
at glory is at their own 'desire' or ambition, and earthly glory may be
so won.  But not so the glory of this Heaven: it can be 'conquered'
only 'by being just and merciful.'"

	|16-18.~  We may need to remind ourselves that the Eagle is speaking as
a corporate entity, his "I" really meaning "we," that is, the virtuous
rulers composing his shape have all left exemplary lives behind them
that draw lip service but no imitative good actions.

	|18.~  The commentators, from Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 16-18) onward,
generally take ^storia~ here in the sense of ^exemplum~, that is,
according to the fourteenth-century Dantist, the wicked on the earth do
not follow the positive examples of these virtuous rulers, present here
in the Eagle, of whom we shall see some in the next canto.  Most of the
following commentators become confused, taking the Eagle as the symbol
of the Roman Empire, rather than as the collectivity of just rulers,
some from other places as well (e.g., David [^Par~. XX.38] and Hezekiah
[^Par~. XX.49]).  But see, for the better reading, Porena (comm. to
this verse).  A slightly different interpretive difficulty is found in
the view that the text means that those in need of a corrective example
are themselves to blame because they fail to read history correctly.
See Baranski ("^Paradiso~ XIX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 286): "Human beings sin, because they do not read
and interpret their history books properly."  That may be true, but it
hardly seems to be what Dante is saying here.

	|19-21.~  The simile pounds home the poet's insistence that the
plurality of souls making up the Eagle's unity sing as a single voice.

	|22-24.~  The protagonist himself, as it were, picks up the theme of
the simile only to express it in metaphor: He believes that these souls
have become a garden of flowers giving off a single perfume, that is,
speaking as one.

	|25-33.~  We probably are reminded of the presence in Limbo of the
virtuous pagans (unauthorized by previous authority, e.g., St. Thomas,
who denies them a place alongside the only inhabitants of the
"orthodox" Limbus, the innocent but unbaptized infants [see the note to
^Inf~. IV.30]).  It was clear from that earlier passage that our poet
had a problem with traditional Christian views of the "guilt" of
otherwise morally good (or even excellent) human beings.  The last
words of his request to the souls in the Eagle make it plain that in
his life he had been bothered by the Church's teaching on the
post-mortal situation of the virtuous heathen.

	|25.~  The gerund (perhaps used here as a present participle)
^spirando~ (breathing forth) is a form of the verb ^(spirare)~ that
Dante uses to indicate the "spiration" of the Holy Spirit.  For
confirmation of this association, see verse 101.

	|28-30.~  The poet here refers, as Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) was
apparently the first commentator to point out, to Cunizza's words in
^Paradiso~ IX.61-62, from which he has learned that the angelic order
of Thrones, presiding over the heaven of Saturn, is designated as
reflecting divine justice.  But this does not mean that these just
souls here in Jupiter are innocent of such knowledge, since they know
about earthly justice and, further, like all the saved, see the higher
form reflected in God Himself. (Momigliano is confused about exactly
this issue, saying [comm. to vv. 28-30] that here Dante contradicts
what he has said in vv. 115-117.)

	|34-39.~  This is the first of two similes based on avian behavior in
this canto.  This one shows a tamed falcon being prepared to go off on
a hunt for prey, while the next, at vv. 91-96, completes the implicitly
joined image with a stork that has fed its young.

For six other references to falconry in the poem, see Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to vv. 34-36).  Torraca explains (comm. to verse 34) that
Frederick II, in his treatise on falconry ^(De arte venandi cum
avibus)~, had boasted that it was he who introduced the Oriental use of
the hood to Europe.

	|35.~  For the double sense here of the Latin verb ^plaudere~ (both "to
beat one's wings" and "to express approval" [as found in both Ovid and
Virgil]), see Scartazzini (comm. to this verse).

	|40-63.~  The following is Tozer's paraphrase of these lines: "God, who
created all things, infinitely surpasses in Himself the wisdom which
appears in His creation (ll. 40-45).  Lucifer, the highest of created
beings, fell, because he lacked as yet the light which would have
enabled him to see God perfectly (ll. 46-48).  How much more feeble
must be the vision of beings inferior to him! (ll. 49-51).  Hence our
minds cannot have any true conception of God's attributes (ll. 52-57),
and, in particular, of His justice (ll. 58-63)."

	|40.~  For the image of the compass in God's designing of the universe,
see Proverbs 8:27, as was perhaps first noted by Tommaseo (comm. to vv.
40-42).  Torraca added (comm. to vv. 40-45) the information that Dante
himself cited this passage in ^Convivio~ III (xv.16).

	|46-48.~  Lucifer's fall (and that of the other rebellious angels)
will have an entire passage to itself for Beatrice's elucidation in
^Paradiso~ XXIX.49-66.	For Adam's contrasting "ripeness," see ^Paradiso~
XXVI.91.  The poet's formulation "per non aspettar lume" might seem to
suggest that Lucifer did not await God's finishing His creation of him,
which would have made him "perfect" with the light of grace.

	|58-60.~  Some commentators follow Scartazzini (comm. to verse 58) in
ascribing this thought to Psalm 35:7 [36:6], "Your judgments are like
the great deep," first cited, if without ascription, by John of
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 70-78).

	|64-66.~  The answer to Dante's question will be found in God alone (in
the metaphor, such shining as is never clouded over), as opposed to
human sight, obfuscated by clouds of unknowing (products of our
fallible or, worse, corrupt senses).

	|67-69.~  Marked by two Latinisms used as rhymes (^latebra~,
"hiding-place"; ^crebra~, "frequent"), this tercet marks the Eagle's
finally coming to grips with Dante's insistent question about the
justice of the condemnation of pagans who had apparently committed no
positive sin.

	|69.~  The poet, allowing the Eagle to do so for him, insists once
again that his life has been marked by a sort of pre-humanist zeal to
defend the pagans from unfair Christian treatment.  But see the note to
vv. 88-90.

	|70-78.~  This passage gives the fullest and most affecting version of
this question, one that was directed at, as we have seen, perhaps the
single most troubling aspect of Christian orthodoxy for Dante.  The
language, if indirectly, revisits a scene from ^Purgatorio~ (XXI.7-13),
the appearance of Statius, himself led to salvation by Virgil,
represented so as to be reminiscent of Jesus, resurrected, appearing to
Cleopas and his wife.  See Luke 24:19, a description of Jesus given by
Cleopas (to Jesus Himself, whom he did not at first recognize), "vir
propheta potens in opere et sermone" (a prophet mighty in deed and
word), perhaps first cited by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 73-75).  In
^Purgatorio~ XXI.17-18, Virgil, hoping Statius will soon enjoy the
fruits of salvation, refers to his own situation, condemned by "the
unerring court / that confines me in eternal exile," with full
acceptance of his guilt in God's eyes.  Was Dante thinking also of
Ovid's altogether different reaction to his imposed exile by command of
Augustus, another kind of divinity altogether, as put forward in the
^Tristia~?  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XVII.111.  It is difficult to
read the passage at hand and not think of Virgil.  Once we encounter
some of the virtuous pagans who were saved in the next canto, it will
once more be difficult not to think of him.

Bortolo Martinelli ("Canto XIX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], pp. 289-91) would cancel the ascription (only found in
some commentaries in any case) of Dante's question to Leviticus 19:35,
substituting for it Job 28:20-21.

The verb tenses and moods of each tercet are instructive.  Based on the
imperfect, here expressing habitual or insistent questioning (^dicevi~,
"you used to say"), Dante's dubiety is seen as still present by the
Eagle (^nasce~, is born); the absence of Christian instruction is
conveyed by three verbs, all in the present subjunctive (^ragioni~,
^legga~, ^scriva~: "speak, read, write").  The second tercet has a
single verb in its main clause, a present indicative statement of this
Indian's good thoughts and deeds (^sono~, "are").  The third has three
verbs in its two main clauses in the present indicative, the first
(^muore~, "dies"), matching his present-tense goodness, while the last
two, interrogatives, a repetition of the verb "to be," challenges the
justice in his relegation to Hell.

	|70-72.~  For a meditation on the challenge to Dante's claim to
universality presented by those dwelling beyond the Indus (i.e., in
India or even farther to the east), see Brena Deen Schildgen ("Dante
and the Indus," ^Dante Studies~ 111 [1993]: 177-93).

	|77.~  As Kenelm Foster explains ("^Paradis~o XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 94
[1976]: 83), this hypothetical Indian must be condemned to Limbo, for
he is (verse 73) without sin.

	|79-90.~  Up until now we have probably been sympathizing with the
protagonist's unwillingness to embrace the justice that would condemn
such an essentially admirable human being who, through no fault of his
own, has not heard the Word.  Suddenly the Eagle pounces on Dante (his
"tu" is most personal, where in most of the rest of his long speech
[vv. 40-90], with the exception of five other second-person singular
pronouns or verbs within four lines, 67-70, he seems to be thinking of
all mortals, three times addressing us as "voi").  "Who are you, Dante,
to judge God's judgment?"  Further (and now the Eagle resorts to
third-person attack, Dante being offhandedly treated as a caviling
subtilizer), is he not aware of what the Bible says?  See the
discussion of Romans 9:20 in the note to vv. 79-81.

	|79-81.~  See Boethius (^Cons. Phil~. IV.5[pr]) in this mode (how
little it is that man knows), cited by Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv.
79-90).  Landino (comm. to this tercet) offers an anthology, drawn from
the Gospels and St. Paul, of several pertinent warnings lest humans
attempt to know God's motives.  As a biblical source for this tercet,
Venturi (comm. to verse 79) adduces the Pauline formula (Romans 9:20)
that will have most currency among later commentators: "o homo tu quis
es qui respondeas Deo?" (But who are you, O man, that you answer back
to God? [Is this the source of the Eagle's "tu"?])  Tommaseo adds a
reference to Dante himself speaking in this vein (^Conv~. IV.v.9).
Sapegno (comm. to verse 79) seems to have been the first commentator to
have suggested Job 38:1-2, "Then the Lord answered Job out of the
whirlwind and said: 'Who is this that darkens counsel by words without
knowledge?'"  This citation has a certain following among the
commentators, yet is clearly not as close to Dante's verse as the
painful question found in St. Paul.

For the notion that this is the most important tercet of the canto, see
Riccardo Scrivano ("^Paradiso~ XIX," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995], p. 29).

	|81.~  A "span" is as much as can be covered by a human palm, that is,
not very much, at least not in comparison with one thousand miles.

	|83.~   See the extensive treatment of this verse by Andrea Battistini
("'Se la Scrittura sovra voi non fosse [...]'. Allusioni bibliche nel
canto XIX del ^Paradiso~," ^Critica letteraria~ 16 [1988]: 211-35).

	|85.~  Cf. Boethius (^Cons. Phil.~ III.3[pr]) on ^terrena animalia~
(earthly beasts), first cited by Poletto (comm. to vv. 85-87), who also
points out that Dante had previously cited this phrase in ^Convivio~
IV.v.9.

	|87.~  See Scartazzini's citation (comm. to this verse) of Malachi 3:6:
"ego enim Dominus et non mutor" (for I am the Lord and I change not).

	|88-90.~  All that is just in the world accords with God's will; on the
other hand, no created good draws God's will to itself; its goodness is
the manifestation of that will, not its cause.  Scartazzini/Vandelli
(comm. to this tercet) point to Dante's similar phrasing in ^Monarchia~
II.ii.5, a passage that, in turn, may reflect the concept of God's
inability to be unjust in Romans 9:14-15.

Having set himself up as a "liberal" on the question of the eternal
punishment of virtuous pagans, Dante now embraces the "conservative"
position, which has it that pagans are justly damned for not having
intuited the truth of Christ.  He will play this hand out again in the
next canto, where he will see saved pagans (their presence in Heaven
surely reflects a "liberal" mind-set), but will contrive to convince us
(and himself?) that they had somehow found Christ.  As we will see,
moral perfection alone will not procure the most just among pagans a
place in Heaven, this poet's Christian pantheon.

	|91-96.~  For the earlier and related avian simile, see the note to vv.
34-39.

	|96.~  The meaning of this expression is that the Eagle is propelled by
the shared wills of its constituent souls.

	|97-99.~  Just as the second avian simile completed the first one (see
the notes to vv. 34-39 and 91-96), so this second simile, pronounced by
the Eagle itself, completes the pattern established by the first
simile.  There (vv. 19-21), many were resolved as one (many embers
sensed as a single heat, many affectionate voices heard as a single
song); here celestial harmony is not audible to human ears, which can
hear only the individual voices and cannot make sense of them.  See
^Inferno~ XX.29-30 for a similar insistence on the necessary failure of
humans to understand God's justice.

	|101-102.~  This formulation might help clarify an issue that confuses
some readers.  The Eagle is not so much a symbol of Roman ^imperium~ as
it is of God's justice made apparent in this world in whatever
embodiment it should happen to take.

Zygmunt Baranski ("^Paradiso~ XIX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University
of Virginia, 1995], p. 285) comments on the density of various words,
like ^segno~, connected to the concept of signification in this canto.
However, while not in any way denigrating his point, one may point out
that, if ^segno~ occurs twice in this canto (and in several others),
it has occurred five times in ^Paradiso~ VI, a canto dedicated to the
eagle of empire.

	|103-105.~  The Eagle's words are pellucidly clear; nevertheless, some
readers contrive not to understand them.  Salvation without belief in
Christ is simply not possible.  We should tuck this notice away in
order to reexamine it in the light of the salvation of both Trajan and
Ripheus in the next canto; in the light of this absolute qualification,
their salvations seem dubious, at the very least.

For an excursus (in English) on the concept of implicit faith, which
alone can make a bit more understandable Dante's unshakable embrace of
the Church's firm ruling in this matter, see Carroll (comm. to vv.
79-84).

	|104-108.~  This is the third set (there will eventually be four [see
^Par~. XXXII.83-87] of identical rhymes on the word ^Cristo~.  See the
notes to ^Paradiso~ XII.71-75 and XIV.103-108.  Joan Ferrante ("Words
and Images in the ^Paradiso~: Reflections of the Divine," in ^Dante,
Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in the Italian Trecento in Honor of
Charles S. Singleton~, ed. A. S. Bernardo and A. L. Pellegrini
[Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1983], p.
125), observing that the word occurs four times in these two tercets,
goes on to explain that it does so in such a way as to form a cross on
the page.  Riccardo Scrivano ("^Paradiso~ XIX," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995],
p. 30) unaccountably omits reference to the fourth of these sets of
identical rhymes.

	|106-108.~  Mowbray Allan ("^Paradiso~ XIX, 106, and St. Thomas's ^Sed
contra~," ^Dante Studies~ 111 [1993]: 195-211) restates and widens some
of his earlier conclusions (see his article "Does Dante Hope for
Virgil's Salvation?" ^Modern Language Notes~ 104 [1989]: 193-205) about
the poem's openness to the possibility of Virgil's salvation.  He reads
this tercet as promising more than Dante probably intends.  The text
states only that, after the Judgment, some of these failed Christians
will be still farther from God than certain pagans.  That statement
probably should not be interpreted as arguing for the possible eventual
salvation of Virgil (or other pagans).  They are ^already~ nearer God,
in the Limbus (see Baranski ["^Paradiso~ XIX," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
{^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995}, p. 292], making this point), than most
of the damned, who are predominantly (at least nominally) Christians.
There is nothing here that requires us to think that Dante thinks that
God will change his mind about Virgil - although of course He has the
ability to do exactly that should He choose.  The evidence of the text,
however, does not in any way suggest that Dante thought that He would.
For example, Virgil is allowed to describe his place in Limbo as
eternal (^Purg~. XXI.18), not something the poet would have put in his
mouth were he to have disagreed, as is (or ought to be) abundantly
clear.

	|106.~  See Singleton (comm. to this verse) for a citation of Matthew
7:22-23 that may be reflected in this verse.

	|109-114.~  In response to this passage, perhaps Venturi (comm. to
verse 109) was the first commentator to cite the following pertinent
text in Matthew (12:41-42): "The men of Nineveh will rise up at the
judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.  The
queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation
and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the
wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here."  For a
reference to the biblical queen of Sheba, seeking the wisdom of Solomon
in Jerusalem, see Dante's ^Epistle~ XIII.3.

Zygmunt Baranski ("^Paradiso~ XIX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], pp. 291-2), citing the previous opinion of Nicolae
Iliescu ("Will Virgil Be Saved," ^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1986], pp. 109-111),
argues that the passage requires that we understand that Dante believes
that some pagans will be exempt from damnation on the strength of their
moral goodness, "that some good Ethiopians and Persians would in fact
be saved."  This is not Dante's point, as the text itself makes
perfectly plain (see the note to verse 110).  Dante clearly indicates
that virtuous pagans (typified, not exhaustively referred to, as
Ethiopians and Persians) present at the Last Judgment and damned by
Christ, along with sinful Christians, will be able to take some solace
in the fact that they will share damnation with those who were given
access to the truth (the Bible and the Church) that pagans were
intrinsically denied.  Baranski (p. 292) goes on to assert that the
Apocalypse promises exactly such conversions of all the peoples of the
world.  That may be, but any sort of attention to this passage does not
allow such an understanding of Dante's text.  In other words, that may
have been John's message, but it is not Dante's.  See the note to verse
113.

On the relationship in this and the next canto of the communion of
saints and the Last Judgment, see Trottmann ("Communion des saints et
jugement dernier dans les chants XIX-XX du ^Paradis~," in ^Pour Dante:
Dante et l'Apocalypse: Lectures humanistes de Dante~, ed. Bruno
Pinchard and Christian Trottmann [Paris: Champion, 2001], pp. 181-98).

	|110.~  This verse has been a stumbling block for some readers.  The
clause "when the two assemblies go their separate ways" almost
certainly does not mean, as some have taken it to do, that the
Ethiopians shall depart from the wicked Christians and go to Heaven.
Rather, it signifies that when the sheep (the saved "soldiery of
Heaven") are separated from the goats (both decent Ethiopian
nonbelievers ^and~ sinful Christians), these virtuous heathen will
(justly) castigate their Christian counterparts, who were given the key
to Heaven and chose not even to try to unlock its gates.

	|112.~  The word "kings" sets up the acrostic with its list of those
rotten rulers that fills the rest of the canto.

	|113.~  The noun ^volume~ was first used, we may remember, to indicate
Virgil's ^Aeneid~ (see ^Inf~. I.84 and note).  Of its nine occurrences
in the poem (see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
{Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}, pp. 78-79],
unaccountably mentioning only seven of these, omitting the two
occurrences found at ^Par~. XXIII.112 and XXVI.119), only this one
refers more or less directly to the Bible, more precisely, to the
Apocalypse (20:12), as was first pointed out in specific terms by
Pietro Alighieri ([Pietro1] comm. to vv. 112-114).  These two uses do
not make Virgil's book a Christian book by association; rather, they
underline the tragic distance separating Virgil from salvation.  The
biblical text refers to the Book of Life, in which are recorded the
names of the saved, and other unnamed "Books of the Dead" (see
discussion of ^Inf~. XXIX.57 in Hollander ["Dante's 'Book of the Dead':
A Note on ^Inferno~ XXIX, 57," ^Studi Danteschi~ 54 {1982}: 31-51]):
"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and
the books were opened.  Then another book was opened, which is the book
of life.  And the dead were judged by what was written in the books,
according to what they had done."  It is more than sufficiently clear
that Dante is here referring, not to the "good" book in Revelation
20:12, but to the "bad" one(s).

	|114.~  That the word ^dispregio~ (here translated "infamy") has
already been seen at ^Inferno~ VIII.51 has been noted in the
commentaries at least since the appearance of Poletto's (1894, to vv.
112-114).  This is its seventh and last appearance in the poem, in one
form or another.

	|115-139.~  Dante's second (and last) full-scale acrostic in the poem
(for the first, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XII.25-63).  There can be
little doubt but that this one, too, is a deliberate contrivance,
whatever the strength of the feelings one happens to harbor against
such literary behavior.  Three sets of three consecutive tercets begin
with the same letter, L, V, and E, respectively, thus spelling the word
^lue~, or "plague."  However, even such astute readers as Bosco and
Reggio (comm. to verse 115), seem to want to join Savi-Lopez (^BSDI~ 10
[1903], p. 328) in thinking Dante's LVE the result of mere chance.
While that seems extreme, at the other end of extremity we find Karla
Taylor ("From ^superbo Il,i@on~ to ^umile Italia~": The Acrostic of
^Paradiso~ 19," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 7 [1987]: 47-65), who wants
to extend the acrostic by adding the "i" and "emme" of its central
tercet (vv. 128-129) so as to get the scrambled word "lueim," an
anagram for ^umile~ (humble).  For her more than questionable procedure
in so doing, see Teodolinda Barolini's complaint (^The Undivine
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1992], pp. 309-10).  Barolini (pp. 308-9) also dismisses three other
"discoverers" of "acrostics" elsewhere in the poem.  However, see Paola
Allegretti ("Un acrostico per Giovanni del Virgilio," ^Studi Danteschi~
69 [2004]: 289-93) for a study of yet another (and hitherto unobserved)
acrostic in Dante's poetic response to Giovanni del Virgilio's
invitation to compose a pastoral eclogue.

	|115-117.~   ^L@i~, here and in the next two tercets, means "in that
volume," that is, in the "Book of the Dead."  Albert (emperor from
1298-1308, i.e., in precedence of Henry VII), was previously denounced
by Dante for his neglect of Italy (^Purg~. VI.97-126).  In 1304 he
invaded and devastated Bohemia.  In the assemblage of fifteen crowned
heads appearing here, Albert is the only one to be named, thus giving
us a sense of how much knowledge of "current events" Dante believed he
could count on in his readers.

	|118-120.~  "On the banks of the Seine," that is, at Paris, where
Philip the Fair caused his subjects great distress when he adulterated
the coinage.  See the note to verse 119.

	|119.~  For Philip's monetarist failings (let Ben Bernanke take note),
see Oelsner (comm. to vv. 119-120): "[the king] debased the coinage to
one-third of its value, in order to meet the expenses of his Flemish
campaigns in 1302.  This is one of several passages in which we see the
horror of tampering with the coinage entertained by Dante, the citizen
of the greatest commercial city of Europe.  As the symbol of greed the
^Florin~ was the 'accursed flower' of ^Par~. IX.130, but as the
foundation of all commercial relations it was worthy of such reverence
that he who tampered with it was to be ranked with him who falsified
the very personality of human beings, the ultimate basis of human
intercourse."  Toynbee ("Filippo+2~" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~])
points out that Philip is always named by periphrasis in the poem,
never by his name, and lists his other main periphrastic appearances:
^Inferno~ XIX.87; ^Purgatorio~ VII.109, XX.91.

	|120.~  This mention of the death of the French king dates the canto as
having been composed (or, at least, modified) after November 1314,
according to Campi (comm. to vv. 118-120); see also Kenelm Foster
("^Paradis~o XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 94 [1976)], p. 85).  The Ottimo
(comm. to vv. 118-120), writing in 1333, knew about the death of Philip
the Fair, caused by a boar.  (The word ^cotenna~, in Tuscany, meant the
hide of a wild pig and perhaps, in Dante's day [as nineteenth-century
commentators report, even then on the tongues of peasants in the
Romagna], referred to the whole dangerous animal.)  Lombardi (comm. to
this verse) explains what happened (citing Villani [^Cron~. IX.66]): A
boar ran among the legs of Philip's horse and the frightened animal
threw his royal rider, killing him.

	|121-123.~  "The pride that makes men thirst" is evidently the craving
to dominate.  Dante is probably referring to the border wars between
Scotland and England in the reign of Edward I (1272-1307).  However,
just which monarch Dante has in mind is debated.  Since the poet had
previously praised Edward I (^Purg~. VII.130-132), some readers have
suggested that Dante was thinking of Edward II, even if he ruled at a
period that places him outside the limits established for everyone else
mentioned in this list (i.e., to have been governing in 1300).  Thus it
probably seems necessary to believe one of two things: Either Dante had
received information that made him change his mind about Edward I, or
else he had incorrect dates for Edward II.  The Scottish leader
referred to is perhaps Robert the Bruce (1306-29).  That would put him
also outside the allotted time zone.  However, as Tozer points out
(comm. to this tercet), since Villani (^Cron~. VIII.90) represents him
as the Scottish leader during Edward I's reign, Dante may have fallen
into the same error.

	|124-126.~   Ferdinand IV of Castile and Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia.  For
the latter see ^Purgatorio~ VII.101-102, where he is described in much
the same way.

	|127-129.~   "The Cripple of Jerusalem" was the derogatory name for the
lame Charles II, king of Apulia and Naples (1285-1309), who claimed the
title "King of Jerusalem" enjoyed by his father, even though it never
was granted to him as the son.  Tozer (comm. to vv. 127-129)
paraphrases and comments:  "His virtues will be seen marked by a unit
(I), his vices by an M (for Lat. ^mille~, 'a thousand').  The one
virtue here intended was liberality, which Dante attributes to him in
^Paradiso~ VIII.82."  Steiner (comm. to vv. 128-130) says that others
have suggested that "I" and "M" refer to the first and last letters of
his desired and fraudulent title, "King of ^I~erusale^m~."

	|130-132.~  The reference is to Frederick II, son of Pedro of Aragon
(see ^Purg~. VII.119), and first regent (1291) and then king of Sicily
(1296-1337).  Sicily is referred to as "the isle of fire" because of
the volcanic activity of Mt. Etna.  For the death of Anchises on its
western shore, see Virgil (^Aen~. III.707-710).  This Frederick II is
not to be confused with the emperor Frederick II (see ^Inf~. X.119 and
note), who died in 1250.

	|133-138.~  See Vittorio Russo ("^Paradiso~ XIX: ^similis fictio
numquam facta fuit per aliquem poetam~," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983], p.
105) for discussion of the rhymes based in the sound of -zz as typical
of the low style, citing ^De vulgari eloquentia~ II.vii.5-6 on
"hirsute" words that are not fitting for the tragic style.

	|133-135.~  Frederick is the only one of the pestilential dozen to
receive more than a single tercet for his dispraises.  With a wry sense
of humor, Dante claims that Frederick is unworthy of attention, yet he
gives Frederick's unworthiness more space than any of his competitors
in malfeasance.  Tozer paraphrases the tercet as follows and then
comments: "'In order to let men know how paltry he is, that which is
written against him will take the form of abbreviations, which will
enumerate many vices within a small space.'  Abbreviations were
commonly used in MSS. to save space; so they would be used in God's
record of Frederic, because he was too insignificant for a large space
to be allotted to him."

	|137-138.~   The uncle, ^barba~, of Frederick II of Sicily was James,
king of Majorca (and of Minorca).  He lost his crown for ten years as a
result of joining Philip the Bold of France in a disastrous invasion of
Catalonia.  His brother, James of Aragon (see ^Purg~. VII.119), in 1291
succeeded to the throne of Aragon, surrendering his kingship of Sicily,
which his father had acquired, and appointed his younger brother,
Frederick, to it in 1296.  By these acts the James boys dishonored both
family and their kingship.

	|137.~  Seven times in the first two canticles the word ^barba~ meant,
what it still means, "beard."  Here it means "uncle," as Francesco da
Buti (comm. to vv. 136-148) informs us it does in Lombard.  Scartazzini
(comm. to this verse) gives its medieval Latin forms and dialectical
presence in nineteenth-century Italy (Lombardy and the Tuscan Romagna).
 According to Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 136-138) it still has that
meaning in some northern dialectical Italian of the mid-twentieth
century.

	|139-141.~  The concluding royal triad share a single tercet:
Dionysius, king of Portugal; Haakon V, king of Norway; and Stephen
Ouros, king of Rascia, the modern Illyria and Dalmatia.  Tozer (comm.
to this tercet): "[Stephen] struck coins of debased metal in imitation
of the Venetian ducat; the resemblance of the two is seen in the
figures given by Philalethes, p. 259."

	|142-148.~  The acrostic comes to a close, but Dante is not yet
finished cataloguing the ills of Europe's suffering kingdoms.  This
ungainly departure from the acrostic mode suggested to Bosco/Reggio
that the acrostic itself may have occurred without design (see the note
to vv. 115-139).  The reader notes that these three examples offer
mixed messages: the first of a good monarch leading to continued good
governance, the second of a good monarch whose work will be undone at
her death, and the third of a disastrous monarch.

	|142-144.~  Tozer (comm. to this tercet): "Hungary had been governed by
corrupt princes until the time of Andrea III (1290-1301), who was a
good sovereign.  'Happy Navarre, if she should defend herself with the
mountain that girds her,' the Pyrenees.  Joan of Navarre had married
Philip the Fair in 1284, but governed her kingdom independently.  On
her death in 1305 it passed to her son Louis Hutin, and when he
succeeded to the throne of France as Louis X in 1314, it was annexed to
the French crown."

	|145-147.~  Tozer (comm. to this tercet): "Cyprus, of which Nicosia and
Famagosta were the chief cities, was badly governed in 1300 by Henry II
of Lusignan, who was a man of corrupt life."

	|148.~  As a coda to the whole parade of princes, we are told that
Henry (as opposed to Andrea III and Joanna of Navarre?), a bad ruler,
keeps the (metaphoric) company of the dirty dozen referred to in the
acrostic.
