	|1-9.~  This  three-part opening simile is not so much difficult as it
is puzzling.  The residue of the confusion resulting from what he has
seen and heard in the previous canto, it prepares the ground for the
protagonist's two-pronged question for Beatrice about human liability.
(1) How can a person not be guilty of a sin who wills to live the good
life but somehow comes up short of doing so?  (2) Where will this kind
of saved soul be located in the afterlife?  While readers are probably
eventually able to make sense of the relationship between the tenor and
the vehicle(s) of the simile, not a few nonetheless wonder about
Dante's practice here.  To deal with the tenor first, the prose sense
of what is at stake is simple.  The protagonist is so eager to have
answers to both his questions (and so afraid of what the answers might
be) that he simply cannot decide which one to ask first and, instead of
speaking, he is silent (vv. 7-9).  As for the vehicles, to some only
the first seems necessary, while the second may initially seem otiose,
and the third redundant, since it only seems to repeat the substance of
the first.

Scartazzini (comm. to verse 6) cites Biagioli's citation of a similar
passage in Michel de Montaigne, ^Essais~ II.14, "Comme nostre esprit
s'empesche soy-mesmes": "C'est une plaisante imagination de concevoir
un esprit balanc$e justement entre deux pareilles envyes.  Car il est
indubitable qu'il ne prendra jamais party, d'autant que l'application
et le choix porte inequalit$e de pris; et qui nous logeroit entre la
bouteille et le jambon, avec egal appetit de boire et de menger, il n'y
auroit sans doute remede que de mourir de soif et de fain" (ed. M. Rat).

	|1-3.~  Bruno Nardi (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e
Letteratura"],
1944, pp. 301-3), has argued that the widespread notion that these
lines are a recasting of Buridan's famed paradox (starving donkey
between two equally distant piles of straw) should be rejected.  As
Nardi and others have shown, the more certain source lies in the ^Summa
theologica~ (I-II, q. 13, a. 6): "If any two things are absolutely
equal, a man is not moved to the one more than to the other; just as a
starving man, if he has food equally appetizing in different directions
and at an equal distance, is not moved to the one more than to the
other" (English text as found in Carroll's commentary to vv. 1-9).
Further, and as Fallani (in his comm. to these verses) points out,
Buridan's ass was posterior to Dante's ^Paradiso~.  A rare early
commentator who finds a source for this material locates it in Thomas's
usual source, Aristotle (^De caelo~ II.xiii.28); see Francesco da Buti
(comm. to vv. 1-12).  Beginning with Lombardi (comm. to this tercet)
and continuing into the twentieth century, one finds insistence on
Thomas as source, neglecting Aristotle (Tommaseo, Andreoli,
Scartazzini, Poletto, and Carroll, among others.  The first
commentators to put the two together, as is in our day fairly
commonplace (e.g., Mattalia, Singleton) were apparently Tozer in 1901
and Torraca in 1905, both in response to this tercet.  However, if one
reads further in Thomas's passage, it is striking, as Sapegno points
out (comm. to vv. 1-9), citing Nardi (pp. 297-303), that Thomas has
proposed this paradox only to refute its relationship to practical
reality -- as might any sensible person.  Zeno's arrow and Buridan's
ass (and Thomas's starving man, as Thomas himself insists) are the sort
of logically developed paradoxes that "philosophers" enjoy creating and
that poets generally enjoy mocking.  Here Thomas, Dante's
"philosopher," rejects philosophical nonsense while Dante, our poet,
seems to sponsor it.

	|4-5.~  The second vehicle of the simile seems, from what one may find
in the commentary tradition, not to have a discernible source anywhere.
 If that is true, what we have here is pure Dantean invention, a
post-Scholastic paradox added to Thomas's.  Whereas in the first tercet
Dante the questioner is likened to a hungry man unable to decide
between two equally tempting foods (for so long a time that he will,
undirected by external agency, die), in these two lines he becomes the
potential victim of his lupine questions, unable to decide which one to
run from, since each looks equally fierce.  While this part of the
extended comparison surely seems askew, given the fact that Dante must
choose which question to ask rather than which to avoid, the passage
does impart something that will later be brought back into play (at
verse 27): these questions are potentially destructive, and thus like
(or at least not unlike) ravening wolves.  And so, after initial
puzzlement, a reader must admit that the apparently otiose comparison
does pay its passage in the greater scheme.  Giuliana Angiolillo
("Canto IV," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1986}], pp. 59-72) complains
about the "incongruity" of this comparison, since it portrays
immobility, not indecision; passivity, not aggression.  But this is to
miss Dante's point: Solutions of his two doubts seem equally attractive
and, potentially at least, the concerns that give rise to each of them
are equally destructive.  For one hypothesis relating to Dante's own
broken vow, which may account for the poet's "overkill" in this simile,
offering a sense of what makes the questions both attractive and
dangerous, see the second paragraph of the note to verses 139-142.

	|6.~  While in the actual world two deer are capable of accomplishing
more damage to a single dog than Dante's text allows, it is clear that
the third vehicle of the simile displays exactly the same relationship
as the first: hungry Dante between two equally tempting viands.  Here
some commentators do suggest a source (see Bosco/Reggio on this verse:
Ovid [^Metam~. V.164-167], first suggested by Pietro di Dante and then
by Daniello, and/or possibly, if Mattalia is correct, Virgil [^Georg~.
III.539-540], as was first suggested by the author of the ^Codice
cassinese~).  Angiolillo ("Canto IV," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1986}], pp.
59-72) proposes the passage from Ovid, and then adds another from
Seneca's drama ^Thyestes~, lines 707-711.

Whatever the source, what seems puzzling is the fact that our usually
orderly and rigorous poet (or so we like to conceive him) here seems to
have allowed himself an unnecessary repetition.  It seems fair to say
that, while detractors of the poet's inclusion of the second piece of
business (see the note to vv. 4-5) have failed to take the point behind
it, the several expressions of discomfort with the third part of the
simile have not had sufficient response.  However, experience teaches
that Dante knows his business far better than we; if we fail to fathom
his purposes, that does not necessarily require that he was without
them.  A possible solution is to suggest that the three-part simile
mirrors the process of the protagonist's actual inner thoughts, moving
from philosophical eagerness to fearful worry and then back to the
first eagerness.

	|13-15.~  The simile puts into parallel Beatrice (placating Dante's
anxiety) and Daniel (stilling Nebuchadnezzar's wrath).  It thus also
necessarily puts into parallel Dante and Nebuchadnezzar, a relation
that at first seems to make no sense at all.  The poet has already
visited this text in the Bible (the second book of the prophet Daniel),
the king's dream and the prophet's interpretation of it (see ^Inf~.
XIV.94-111 for Dante's version of that dream, embodied in the
representation of the ^veglio di Creta~).  (For a study of the
Florentine's use of the Book of Daniel, see P$ezard ("Daniel et Dante
ou les vengeances de Dieu," ^Studi Danteschi~ 50 [1973]: 1-96).  Here
he fastens on its perhaps strangest aspect: the new king's desire to
kill all the wise men in his kingdom of Babylon who could neither bring
his forgotten dream back to mind nor then interpret it -- about as
unseemly a royal prerogative as anyone has ever sought to enjoy.  Thus
it seems natural to wonder in what way(s) Dante may possibly be
conceived of as resembling the wrathful king of Babylon.  The entire
commentary tradition observes only a single link: Nebuchadnezzar's
displeasure and Dante's puzzlement are both finally relieved by
(divinely inspired -- see Trucchi [comm. to vv. 13-15]) external
intervention on the part of Daniel, in the first case, of Beatrice, in
the second.  However, saying that is akin to associating Joseph Stalin
with Mother Teresa on the grounds that both were among the most famous
people of their times.  Why should Dante have cast himself as the
tyrannical Babylonian ruler?  That is a question that has stirred only
the shorelines of the ponds of commentaries and has never had an
answer.  If one looks in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~ (77-82), however,
one finds a gloss to ^Paradiso~ I.4-9 that is germane here.  And
apparently, in any discussion of this passage, only G.R. Sarolli, in
his entry "Nabuccodonosor" (^ED~ IV [1973]), has noted the striking
similarity in the two texts, going on to argue that this similarity
serves as a further proof of the authenticity of the epistle.  In that
passage Dante explains that his forgetting of his experience of the
Empyrean (because he was lifted beyond normal human experience and
could not retain his vision) has some egregious precursors: St. Paul,
three of Jesus' disciples, Ezechiel (their visionary capacity certified
by the testimony of Richard of St. Victor, St. Bernard, and St.
Augustine); and then he turns to his own unworthiness to be included in
such company (if not hesitating to insist that he had been the
recipient of such exalted vision): "But if on account of the sinfulness
of the speaker [Dante himself, we want to remember] they should cry out
against his claim to have reached such a height of exaltation, let them
read Daniel, where they will find that even Nebuchadnezzar by divine
permission beheld certain things as a warning to sinners, and
straightway forgot them" (81 -- tr. P. Toynbee).  Dante, like the
Babylonian king, has had a vision that was God-given, only to forget
it.  And now he is, Nebuchadnezzar-like, distraught; Beatrice, like the
Hebrew prophet, restores his calm.  Thus the typological equation here
is not idle; Dante ^is~ the new Nebuchadnezzar in that both he and the
wrathful king, far from being holy men (indeed both were sinners), had
access to visionary experience of God, only to forget their vision.
The king enters this perhaps unusual history, that of forgetting a
divine revelation on the part of those who were less than morally
worthy, as "the first forgettor"; Dante, as the second (see
Hollander,"^Paradiso~ 4.14: Dante as Nebuchadnezzar?" ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [May 2005]).

	|16-18.~  We are now reminded that all the fuss (vv. 1-12) over Dante's
paralyzed will, rendering him unable to choose which question to ask,
was eventually in vain, since Beatrice can read his thoughts in God
anyway.  The poem, of course, needs to hold our attention and thus make
Dante's choices important, even when they are technically unnecessary.
His development, as sinner gradually being made worthy of the visionary
experience of God and thus of salvation itself, is the major strand of
the narrative of the ^cantica~.  And thus the poet may at times allow
himself a certain latitude with the rules of his own game, making his
work the richer for it.

	|19-27.~  Beatrice addresses the nature of Dante's questions.  The
first concerns the apparent fact that even a person who never ceases
willing the good, and who ceases doing good only by virtue of the force
of others, is in some way responsible for that failure.  The second,
zeroing in on a problem that we frequently encountered throughout the
previous canto (see the note to ^Par~. III.29-30), concerns the
ultimate abode of the blessed: whether or not they return to dwell
forever in the stars that most shaped their personalities.  This is the
more pernicious of these two dangerous questions and will thus be
addressed first, if at lesser length, in vv. 28-63 (Beatrice's answer
to the first question will be found at vv. 64-114).

	|19-21.~  Beatrice makes the need to deal with Dante's first question
seem even more pressing by revealing that for him it has a personal
interest: It is ^he~ who wonders if his own merit might be diminished
through no fault of his own.

	|24.~  Beatrice refers to Plato's teaching as it is found in his
^Timaeus~.  See the note to vv. 49-54.  Torraca, in his comment to this
verse, the phrase "secondo la sentenza di Platone," cites Thomas's
^Summa contra Gentiles~ (II.83), "secundum Platonis sententiam."
Bosco/Reggio posit the possibility that, if Dante did not know the text
of the ^Timaeus~ directly, he might have been acquainted with key
portions of it through St. Augustine, St. Thomas, Albertus Magnus,
Cicero, or Macrobius.  This is the position, assumed tentatively, by
most students of the question; some, however, take it that Dante did
have direct knowledge of at least this one Platonic text.  For Dante's
knowledge of Plato in general and the ^Timaeus~ in particular, see
Edward Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and
Classical Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 {1896}], pp.
156-64).  The great British Dantist makes a sound case for Dante's
direct acquaintance with Chalcidius's text of the ^Timaeus~ (41 D and
E, 42 B, p. 157) in the relevant passages of this canto and ^Convivio~
IV.xxi.2 and II.xiii.5, although on one occasion he admits to harboring
a reasonable doubt in that respect, offering a near disclaimer in the
clause "in whatever form it found its way to Dante" (p. 160).  (Moore
also [p. 157] refers to a lost commentary on Plato's dialogue with
Timaeus by Thomas Aquinas that Ozanam refers to [in ^Dante et la
philosophie Catholique~, p. 197], and wonders whether this was one of
his sources.)  Margherita de Bonfils Templer ("Genesi di un'allegoria,"
^Dante Studies~ 105 [1987]: 79-94), building on her previous
investigations (see p. 90, n. 5 for these), makes her case for Dante's
use of the glosses to the ^Timaeus~ of Guillaume de Conches.  And see
her study of Platonic gnoseology in ^Convivio~ ("Il dantesco ^amoroso
uso di Sapienza~: sue radici platoniche," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 7
[1987]: 5-27).  More recently, see Giuliana Carugati's investigation
("Retorica amorosa e verit@a in Dante: Il ^De causis~ e l'idea della
donna nel ^Convivio~," ^Dante Studies~ 112 [1994]: 161-75) of Dante's
reliance on Proclus in ^Convivio~ II and III.  For a view counseling
caution in attributing direct knowledge of the ^Timaeus~ to Dante, who
refers to the work by name only once in ^Convivio~ (^Conv~. III.v.6)
and then here, see Marta Cristiani, "Timeo," ^ED~ V (1976), pp. 604-5.
See also her entries "Platone," ^ED~ IV (1973), pp. 546-50, and
"platonismo,"  ^ED~ IV (1973), pp. 550-55.

	|25-27.~  Both of the protagonist's questions reflect a dangerous
uncertainty on his part about the nature of the free will, which will
be the subject of Beatrice's urgent lecture at the beginning of the
next canto.  If he believes that compromise in making vows is possible
or that our souls' choices are controlled by the stars that govern our
natures, he is in heresy.  The second doubt, since it would destroy the
notion of free will utterly (and not just partially), is the more
dangerous, which is why Beatrice chooses to address it first.   As
Trucchi, discussing this tercet, points out, Plato's notion that souls
return to their formative stars (embraced by some early Christians),
was finally condemned at the Council of Constantinople in the year 540.

	|25.~  Dante's use of the Latin infinitive as a noun is not without
precedent in the work: See ^Paradiso~
III.79, ^esse~ (to be [as substantive, "being"]); ^Paradiso~ XIX.2,
^frui;~ and, more interestingly in this context, ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.143,
where ^velle~ (to will [as substantive, "the will"]) itself reappears,
once again rhyming with ^stelle~ (stars).  That only other recurrence
of this Latin word may be more programmatic than has been noticed.
Plato's apparent doctrine, rejected here, receives a final disapproving
glance in the last lines of the poem, in which Dante has his final
vision of the universe as it truly is, and not as Plato's ^Timaeus~
(and Dante's ^Convivio~ [IV.xxi.2]: "Plato and others maintained that
they issued from the stars and were more or less noble according to the
nobility of their star" -- tr. Lansing; and see also ^Conv~. II.xiii.5)
might have us believe.

There are some seventy-five Latin words or passages incorporated in
this insistently vernacular work, more than half of them in its most
"churchly" ^cantica~, ^Purgatorio~, as is not surprising.

	|28-39.~  Beatrice's refutation is in three main parts:

\<pre\>
(1) Scriptural justification for God's showing saved souls in the stars, vv. 28-39.
(1a) Why such ways of presenting divine truth are necessary, vv. 40-48.
(2) Plato's possible error in the ^Timaeus~, vv. 49-54.
(3) Plato's potential agreement with Christian doctrine, vv. 55-63.
\</pre\>

The first part refutes not only what Dante has shown himself to believe
in the previous canto, namely that the souls in the Moon are there
permanently (see the note to ^Par~. III.29-30), but resolves what
Piccarda and even Beatrice (depending on how one reads verse 30 of
^Par~. III) had left an open question.  Now we are told by Beatrice,
definitively, that no soul of Paradise is present in any star, except
for the occasion of Dante's visit to the spheres.  Thus if, while
reading the ending of the previous canto, we may (quite reasonably)
have thought that Piccarda and Constance were heading back into the
matter of the Moon, we now probably have to understand that they have
returned to their home in the Empyrean.

	|28.~  Indicating only the highest rank of angels, the Seraphim,
Beatrice reminds Dante that ^all~ the nine ranks of angels are in the
Empyrean and are the beings closest to God.  Here the poet resolves a
potential problem, similar to that caused by the appearance of the
souls in the spheres, in that readers might eventually assume that the
angelic order most associated with a certain heaven actually dwells in
that heaven.  This verse cancels that potential reading before it can
be applied.

	|29-30.~  Moses, Samuel, John the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and
Mary are all to be found in that same placeless place known as the
Empyrean.  When we read ^Paradiso~ XXXII, we will find all of these but
Samuel represented as having been seen by the protagonist among the
eighteen souls actually pointed out there by St. Bernard.  Beatrice's
little list is "ecumenical," involving two Hebrews (Moses and Samuel in
the role of the first and last "great jurists" of Israel, as it were),
one "Hebrew-Christian" (the Baptist), and two Christians (John and
Mary).  Since all four whom we do eventually see in the Rose are in its
highest tier, we may assume that Samuel is at that level also.  (Why
Dante has chosen Samuel, rather than Abraham, Solomon, David, or still
another, is not immediately clear; see the discussion in the note to
verse 29.)  It would also seem likely that Dante is paralleling
elements in his angelic and human populations of the Rose, referring
only to the highest rank of each, thus distinguished from all who are
at lower levels.

	|29.~  The meaning of Beatrice's remark is not difficult to grasp.  The
angels (she refers to the highest order, the Seraphim, but from the
context we know that she means all nine orders) and all the blessed are
found, and found only, in the Empyrean.  From ^Par~. XXXII we know that
four of the five saints referred to here are in the highest rank of the
stadium-rose: Moses (vv. 131-132), John the Baptist (vv. 31-33), John
the Evangelist (vv. 127-128), Mary (vv. 88-93).  Samuel is not among
the eighteen saints referred to in that canto, but since all four who
are, like their Seraphic counterparts, have been elevated to the
topmost rank, we are probably meant to understand that Samuel has been
also; i.e., we are to understand that he is there, even if we do not
see him.

But why Dante singles him out here (and why he passes him over in
silence in ^Par~. XXXII) are questions rarely formed and perhaps never
answered.  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 28-30) was perhaps the first to refer
to the fact that Moses and Samuel were only once referred to in the
same passage of Scripture, Jeremiah 15:1: "Then said the Lord unto me,
though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be
toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth."
G.R. Sarolli, "Samuele," ^ED~ IV (1973), does improve upon the
relatively sorry record of the commentators, who just do not seem to
realize that this sudden appearance of Samuel in the poem calls for
study.  Why, for instance, if Dante wants to pick a pair of Old
Testament "heroes," does he not couple Moses with his favorite Hebrew
figure, David?  Perhaps, since Samuel was the last of the Judges of
Israel, in Dante's mind he balances the first Hebrew "law-giver," Moses
(see ^Inf~. IV.57).  Sarolli points to Samuel's position among the
exegetes as ^typus Christi~ as well as a figure of John the Baptist and
to his role in transferring the kingly power from Saul to David as
clues to Dante's reasons for his lofty placement in the ^Commedia~.
(But why, we wonder, was not that lofty placement confirmed, as it was
for his four fellow-nominees, in ^Par~. XXXII?)  Toynbee had already
made the point that the rest of Dante's references to Samuel by name
(^Mon~. II.vii.8; III.vi.1-6; ^Epist~. VII.19) have to do with Samuel's
intervention that resulted in the termination of Saul's kingship.
(This last passage is a casuistic argument, in which Dante insists that
Samuel had the power to depose Saul ^not~ because he was God's vicar,
which the hierocrats insisted was indeed true [thus buttressing their
case for papal intervention in imperial affairs], but because God
selected him as an "angelic" messenger, His direct emissary.)  Such is
dramatically true of Dante's second epistle to Henry VII (^Epist~.
VII.19), in which he compares Henry to Saul, about to be dethroned by
Samuel (I Sam. [I Reg.] 15), and in which his accusations put Dante
unmistakably in Samuel's place.  If the order of composition of these
Samuel-Saul passages is ^Epistle~ VII (late 1311), ^Paradiso~ IV,
^Monarchia~ II and III, the last three likely written within only a few
months of one another in ca. 1314, we may begin to have an inkling of
why Samuel, so long absent from Dante's pages, should suddenly have
sprung to life in them.  Henry's foundering kingship shows the need for
a new Samuel to hector the struggling king, a role that Dante, no
stranger to answering an elevated call to action, tries to take on.
For Henry's increasing similarity to Saul, see the article referred to
by Filippo Bognini (Bogn.2007.1), p. 93 (n. 54).
By the time Dante is writing ^Paradiso~ XXXII, Henry is dead, and thus well
beyond useful hectoring.

	|31-32.~  Piccarda and Constance, we are told, are in the same space as
that occupied by these glorious figures.  Thinking of it this way, we
can understand why they are not in the least disturbed by their lower
rank within the Rose (^Par~. III.70-87).  Exactly where in the
celestial Rose they are seated is never revealed to us; we know only
that they are fairly low in it (but at least halfway up, above the
innocent babes [see ^Par~. XXXII.37-48] and yet beneath the height
attained by St. Clare [see ^Par~. III.98-99], whatever that may be).

	|33.~  The souls in Plato's ^Timaeus~ are said to remain longer periods
in their stars in accord with their greater goodness (for the text, see
Campi's commentary to vv. 28-33), a bit of doctrine slapped aside in
this single verse.  The slap also hits the cheek of Dante himself: see
the text of ^Convivio~ IV.xxi.2, cited in the note to verse 25, above.

	|34.~  Rhyme apparently forces Dante into a self-contradiction.  The
Empyrean is not a ^giro~ (circle), like the revolving physical heavens,
but a point, both infinitely large (^Par~. XXXIII.85-93) and infinitely
small (^Par~. XXVIII.16-21).  Nonetheless, here he says it is a ^giro~.

	|35.~  The phrase ^dolce vita~ (sweet life), here used for the first
time to indicate the life of the blessed in God's eternal presence (see
also ^Par~. XX.48, XXV.93), has a biting resonance in Federico
Fellini's Dante-haunted film of 1960, ^La dolce vita~.

	|36.~  The relative beatitude of the blessed is defined as the result
of their greater or lesser ability to respond to the breath of the Holy
Spirit.  Normal human competitiveness makes it hard to imagine human
beings, even fairly selfless and generous ones, taking joy in their
lesser ability to respond to God's love.  On the other hand, our
experience of some artists, musicians, and athletes reveals that there
are indeed professionals who gladly admire the greater ability of their
betters and enjoy participation in the same activity in which these
"stars" excel.  Unfortunately, there is probably less such admirable
conduct than one might hope.

	|37.~  This verse seals Beatrice's presentation of the temporary nature
of the souls' presence in the Moon, as she uses a past definite (^si
mostraro~ [put themselves on view here]) to indicate that they no
longer do so -- their time in the Moon is over.  See the similar use of
the past definite in verse 32, ^appariro~ (appeared), which probably
also indicates that they are no longer present.

	|39.~  Beatrice's words have given rise to a series of misreadings.
What Dante says is that Piccarda and her companions in the Moon occupy
a less exalted rank in Heaven; commentators (and translators) tend to
say that they occupy ^the least~ (i.e., the very lowest) of the
heavenly ranks.  However, the comparative adverb ^meno~ (less) is never
used in the ^Commedia~ as a superlative.  The reason for this attempt
to turn Dante's vague placement of them into something far more
definite is perhaps found in an assumption that, if these women are
here encountered in the lowest heaven, they must then be in the lowest
rank of Heaven.  The poem does not permit any such certainty.  See the
note to vv. 31-32.  (Of course those who think that these souls are
ticketed to spend eternity in the Moon take the verse as merely stating
an obvious truth: they ^are~ in the lowest heaven now, and will remain
there.)

	|40-42.~  The need to speak to the human intellect in terms reflecting
the experience of the senses will be more fully explored in the next
two tercets, the corollary, as it were, to what has just been said
here.  And here Dante presents familiar Thomistic insistence on the
priority (and usefulness) of sense data, an Aristotelian position and
most certainly a counter-Platonic one.

	|40.~  For a study of the word ^ingegno~ in the ^Commedia~ (a word
introduced at ^Inf~. II.7 and then found some eighteen times, with a
last appearance in ^Par~. XXIV.81), taking this passage as his point of
departure, see Paul Dumol (^The Metaphysics of Reading Underlying
Dante's "Commedia": The "Ingegno"~ [New York: Peter Lang, 1998], pp.
1-13, 177-95).  And for the source of Dante's concept in Aristotle
(^Ethics~ VI.1), as commented upon and developed by Aquinas, see Dumol,
pp. 95-124.  This is the faculty called "racionativum," the ^vis
cogitativa~, i.e., practical or scientific knowledge.

	|43-48.~  The phenomenon referred to by Beatrice, of ancient Christian
lineage, is known as "accommodative metaphor."  Put simply (and Dante's
text does this admirably), it is the metaphoric presentation of higher
things and higher beings that ordinary mortals simply have not the
experiential background to understand.  (For the closeness of Dante's
presentation of it here to the exposition made by St. Thomas, see
Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969}, p. 192] and Dumol [^The Metaphysics of Reading
Underlying Dante's "Commedia": The "Ingegno"~ {New York: Peter Lang,
1998}, pp. 5-6].)  E.g., angels are pure being (or, as Dante would say,
"pure act" [see ^Par~. XXIX.33]) and have no visible aspect.  So that
we may better conceive them, we are allowed to think of them as having
wings, faces, voices, etc.  Similarly, God Himself is beyond any
anthropomorphic human imagining, but Scripture allows us to think of
Him as having hands and feet, etc.  St. Thomas, in fact, has discussed
the passage that thus became perhaps the ^locus classicus~ for
discussions of the phenomenon, Isaiah 51:9.  Interestingly enough,
these remarks are imbedded in his discussion of fourfold allegory that
is so densely reflected in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~.  Here is what
Thomas has to say about accommodative metaphor (^Summa~ I.i.10):  "Per
voces significatur aliquid proprie, et aliquid figurative. Nec est
litteralis sensus ipsa figura, sed id quod est figuratum. Non enim cum
Scriptura nominat Dei brachium, est litteralis sensus quod in Deo sit
membrum hujusmodi corporale: sed id quod per hoc membrum significatur,
scilicet virtus operativa" (The parabolic sense is contained in the
literal, for by words things are signified properly or figuratively.
Nor is the figure itself, but that which is figured, the literal sense.
 When Scripture speaks of God's arm, its literal sense is not that God
has such a member, but only what is signified by this member, namely,
operative power).  Metaphor, in Thomas's discussion, is associated with
the parabolic sense, a sub-category of the literal sense, in which
things that are literally untrue nevertheless may have a significance
other than that which they seem to possess.  Thomas is quite clear that
one must not confuse a metaphoric literal sense with a
historical/literal sense that does have further (historical) meaning.
It would not be overbold to suggest that the central distinction
between the "allegory of the poets" and the "allegory of the
theologians" first referred to by Dante in ^Convivio~ (II.i.4) is based
on this distinction.  And for a similar Dantean concern for scriptural
language and its potential relation to the ^Comedy~, see also
^Monarchia~ III.iv.7: "Augustine says in the ^De civitate Dei~: 'It
must not be thought that every reported event has a further meaning;
but those which have no further meaning are also included for the sake
of those which do have such a meaning.  Only the ploughshare breaks up
the soil, but for this to happen the other parts of the plough are
necessary as well'" (tr. P. Shaw).  Dante's own concern with the
problem of metaphor, expressed in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~, is also
directly related to his thoughts about Plato's possible use of this
trope, a subject confronted in this canto (see discussion in the note
to vv. 55-63).  See ^Epistle~ XIII.84: "For we perceive many things by
the intellect for which language has no terms -- a fact which Plato
indicates plainly enough in his books by his employment of metaphors;
for he perceived many things by the light of the intellect which his
everyday language was inadequate to express"(tr. P. Toynbee).

In an important sense, almost all of Dante's experience of the
afterworld in the first thirty cantos of this canticle is metaphoric,
i.e., what he sees in the stars is there only temporarily and for
illustrative purposes.  For similar understandings, see Freccero,
"^Paradiso~ X: The Dance of the Stars" (in ^Dante: The Poetics of
Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1986 {1968}], pp. 221-26); Hollander (^Allegory~ [1969], pp. 192-201);

Studies~ 90 [1972]: 77-91); Mazzotta (^Dante, Poet of the Desert~

Language Notes~ 114 [1999]: 1-13.  And see the appreciation of a
Harvard freshman, Chris Hampson, in a seminar in the autumn of 2005:
"The whole point is that this is ^not~ what it's really like."

	|46-48.~  As examples of ways in which we may have a graphic sense of
exactly what the phrase "accommodative metaphor" signifies, church
windows to this day represent angels with human features, while even
seven hundred years ago Dante knew that angels were disembodied, were
"pure act" (^Par~. XXIX.33).  Humans are allowed to conceive of such
higher realities in more concrete and familiar terms.  Unnamed, Raphael
joins periphrastically his two fellow archangels, the ones most
frequently referred to in literature and life.  Indeed, only Gabriel
and Michael enjoy a presence in the standard Bible, while Raphael's is
limited to the Book of Tobit (see the note to verse 48).

	|48.~  Raphael is generally accounted one of the seven angels "who
stand before the Lord" (Apoc. 8:2).  The apocryphal Book of Enoch (ch.
21) furnishes the names of the four others, of whom only Uriel is much
known today (and then mainly through his presence in Milton's ^Paradise
Lost~).  The story of how this archangel allowed Tobias to cure the
blindness of his father, Tobit, is told in the now apocryphal Book of
Tobias (11:2-15).  That Dante elected to use this particular
circumlocutory detail to identify Raphael may seem puzzling.  However,
it was one of the few concrete details associated with this archangel
known to him.  And consult ^Paradiso~ XXVI.12 for another brief
reference to a miraculous cure for blindness, that conferred by the
laying on of hands by Ananias.  For a substantial recounting, one
nearly as controlled and entertaining as a ^novella~ by Boccaccio, of
the startling biblical narrative concerning Tobias and Raphael, see the
commentary of Jacopo della Lana to vv. 40-48.

	|49-54.~  The ^Timaeus~ argues that the souls of the dead return to the
stars which gave them birth.  This is heresy, ^tout court~, if it is
meant literally.  Beatrice's correction of Dante's error, concocted in
the previous canto as a recapitulation of the error he had in fact
first made in the ^Convivio~, should end our own confusion as to the
presence of the souls in the spheres.  They appear in a sort of cosmic
accommodative metaphor, thus suggesting that all the last canticle up
to its thirtieth canto (with a brief hiatus in the twenty-third -- see
the note to ^Par~. XXIII.61-63) is a vast metaphoric preparation for
the seeing face-to-face that will occur in the Empyrean.  Further, such
an understanding reminds us how "historical," how "real," everything
described and seen in the first two canticles has seemed in comparison.

	|51.~  The verb ^par[e]~ (seems) begins to open the door to Dante's
attempt to hedge his attack on certain of Plato's views  in vv. 55-60.

	|54.~  The reference to "form" here indicates, in language reflective
of Scholastic terminology, an individuated human soul that inhabits a
specific body.

	|55-63.~  Dante opens the question of the potential truth to be found
in Plato's literally untrue teachings.  Here again (see the note to vv.
13-15) the reader will want to turn to the ^Epistola a Cangrande~,
again near its conclusion (84): "For we perceive many things by the
intellect for which language has no terms -- a fact which Plato
indicates plainly enough in his books by his employment of metaphors;
for he perceived many things by the light of the intellect which his
everyday language was inadequate to express" (tr. P. Toynbee).

Dante's view of Plato would seem to indicate great respect (if not as
much as for Aristotle, given greater praise than his teacher in
^Inferno~ IV), a sense that some of his teaching was potentially or
actually heretical, and a further sense of admiration, perhaps based
principally on what in Plato he found most poet-like, his use of
metaphor to express truth slantwise.  In both major moments in which
Dante discusses Plato, here and in the epistle, the salient subject is,
indeed, Plato's use of metaphor.  It is possible that Dante is
fervently opposed to those who read Plato as a teller of literal truth
(in which reading he is nothing short of a heretic ^avant-la-lettre~,
as are, on historical grounds, the neo-platonists, in Dante's view).
It seems possible, however, that Dante is willing to allow the
philosopher himself a potential escape route; he may have seemed to
him, in the end, more like a poet than a philosopher.  Dante's teacher,
Thomas Aquinas, is cited by Oelsner (comm.to ^Par~. IV.51) as allowing
for the possibility, just as we have seen Dante do here, of a possible
metaphoric truth in some of Plato's ^dicta~ that are literally untrue.

	|55-57.~  Bosco/Reggio, in their comment on this passage, point out
that its source may lie in Albertus Magnus, ^De natura et origine
animae~ (II.7), since that is a sure source for the embryology of
^Purgatorio~ XXV, as was established by Bruno Nardi ("L'origine
dell'anima umana secondo Dante" [1931-1932], repr. in his ^Studi di
filosofia medievale~ [Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1960]).
Should that be true (and, as they argue, it seems likely that it is,
since there is little to suggest Dante really knew any Plato directly,
even in Latin translation), it would deeply undercut the notion that
Dante's acquaintance with the ^Timaeus~ was firsthand.  And this would
also reveal that Dante had a noted precursor in trying at least to open
the question of Plato's possible acceptability to Christian thinkers,
as one tradition has even no less a rigorist than Thomas Aquinas doing
(see the last sentence of the note to vv. 55-63).

	|55.~  For the view that the meaning of ^sentenza~ here must be
"intention," see Federico Sanguineti ("Per ^Paradiso~ 4:55," ^Dante
Studies~ 117 [1999]: 195-97).  But Dante's usual practice and the
likely significance of this tercet point rather in the direction of
"meaning," as any number of commentators believe.  And see, for a
previous use of the word in this canto, verse 24, "secondo la sentenza
di Platone" (in accord with Plato's teaching).

	|58-60.~  The nature of Dante's own "modified astrology" has already
been made clear in Marco Lombardo's discussion of free will and its
relationship to astral influence, particularly in ^Purgatorio~
XVI.67-84.  While any astrology at all seems mere foolishness to most
modern readers, Dante's position, which mirrors that of St. Augustine,
is that whatever influence the stars have on us, it in no way reduces
our ability to choose the good.  Our birth stars may incline us in one
direction or another (see ^Par~. VIII.122-135), but we remain totally
responsible for our choices, our actions.

Jes$us Mu@noz ("Es Dante antiplatonico en Filosofia?  Relacion
Aritoteles-Platon, en Dante filosofo," in ^Atti del Congresso
internazionale di studi danteschi~, vol. II [Florence: Sansoni, 1966],
p. 495), points out, as part of his wider argument (Dante is not
"anti-platonic"), that Plato is referred to by name three times in the
poem (^Inf~. IV.134; ^Purg~. III.43; ^Par~. IV.24), while Aristotle is
named (^Purg~. III.43) or clearly referred to (^Inf~. IV.131) but
twice.  This is hardly convincing evidence.

	|61-63.~  The "unenlightened" theory of astral influence sponsored by
the ancients (and possibly by Plato) resulted in the naming of the
planets for the powers (and limitations) they conferred on human
beings.  Dante's version supersedes that theory and restores free will
to human conduct.

	|62.~  The exceptions among the ancients were, naturally, the
monotheistic Hebrews.

	|64-117.~  Dante's first question, dealt with second because it has
less "venom" in it (verse 27), finally has its day in court.  That it
is less potentially dangerous to the health of the soul does not mean
that it is not worrisome, as the amount of space it receives now (over
fifty lines) attests.  It, too, centrally involves the freedom of the
will.

	|64-66.~  Beatrice suggests that the protagonist's failure to
understand the precise rules that govern the keeping of vows, unlike
the larger issue of the freedom of the will, is less likely to
interfere with his love for her, his guide to the truth found in God.
His potential problem with his second "doubt" is a total one, while
this one is only partial.

	|67-69.~  Beatrice offers up another paradox (see her argument in
^Purg~. XXXIII.94-99 that Dante's inability to remember his sins is the
very proof that he committed them): For mortals ^not~ to understand
divine justice is evidence (the probable meaning of ^argomento~ here,
though there is debate on the point) that it exists.

	|70-72.~  Because the nature of this question concerning vows is not so
lofty that a closer-to-divine intelligence is required for its
solution, Beatrice will be able to explain it fully to mortal Dante.

	|73-81.~  Beatrice is brutally clear: Since the will by its very nature
always seeks the good, any capitulation to external force is a
violation of God's love.  A modern reader may sense a certain outrage
at this line of thought.  It would seem to call for martyrdom as the
only adequate response if another would divert us from our true path by
use of force or the threat of force.  As the following examples will
make plain (vv. 82-87), that is exactly what is called for.  If we fail
to keep our absolute will intact (the term is employed at verse 109;
see the note to that passage, vv. 109-114), allowing it to be swayed by
fear, we are guilty of the sin that afflicted both Piccarda and
Constance, who should have found some way to return to the cloister, no
matter what harm they thought they might have faced in so doing.
Dante's doctrine is as simple and as terrifying as that.  For
discussion of these questions, see Singleton's commentary to vv. 73-74;
76-78.

	|77-78.~  The image of the flame that, temporarily twisted by external
force from its natural upright position, will always by its very nature
raise itself back up underlines the natural propensity of the will to
the good, despite the force that may be used against it.

	|82-87.~  As he did so often in ^Purgatorio~, Dante combines a
Christian and a pagan exemplary figure to make his point: "St.
Lawrence, a deacon of the Church of Rome, said to have been a native of
Huesca in Spain who suffered martyrdom under the Emperor Valerian, Aug.
10, 258.  The tradition is that, being commanded by the prefect of Rome
to deliver up the treasures of the Church which had been entrusted to
his charge by Pope Sixtus II, he replied that in three days he would
produce them.  On the expiration of the appointed time he presented to
the prefect all the sick and poor to whom he had given alms, with the
words 'Behold the treasures of Christ's Church'.  The prefect thereupon
directed St. Lawrence to be tortured, in order to make him reveal where
the treasures were hidden.  But, torture proving ineffectual, he was
stretched on an iron frame with bars, like a gridiron, beneath which a
fire was kindled so that his body was gradually consumed.  In the midst
of his agony he is said to have remained steadfast, and to have mocked
his executioners, bidding them to turn his body that it might be
equally roasted on both sides (cf. Prudentius, ^Peristephanon liber~
401-9)" (Toynbee, "Lorenzo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  "Gaius
Mucius Scaevola, Roman citizen who, when Lars Porsena of Clusium was
besieging Rome, made his way into the enemy's camp with the intention
of killing Porsena; by mistake, however, he stabbed the king's
secretary instead of the king himself.  Being seized, Mucius was
ordered by the king to be burned alive, whereupon he thrust his right
hand into a fire, which was already lighted for a sacrifice, and held
it in the flames without flinching.  Porsena, struck with admiration at
his fortitude, ordered him to be set free; in return Mucius informed
him that there were 300 noble youths in Rome who had sworn to take the
king's life, that the lot had fallen upon him to make the first
attempt, and that his example would be followed by the others, each as
his turn came.  Porsena, impressed with this account of the
determination of the Romans, made proposals of peace and withdrew from
the siege.  From the circumstance of the loss of his right hand, Mucius
was thenceforward known as Scaevola ('left-handed').  Dante [also]
mentions Mucius in connexion with this incident [in] ^Conv~. IV.v.13;
and, with a reference to Livy (^Ab urbe~ II.12) as his authority in
^Mon~. II.v.14" (Toynbee, "Muzio" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Will
so firm as that, however, is rarely found.  Nonetheless, willingness to
accept even martyrdom remains the only eventual solution for this
problem.  And the example of Scaevola makes the message even more
painful: one must be prepared to do violence even against oneself in
the service of liberty.

	|89-90.~  For Beatrice's paraphrase of Dante's unthinking analysis of
the problem addressed here, see vv. 19-21.  It has now been "canceled"
and should trouble him no more.

	|91-99.~  Beatrice now offers a sort of corollary to the message she
has just delivered, anticipating Dante's further question: How can
Piccarda be telling the truth when she says that neither she nor
Constance ever ceased wanting to be back in their convents (^Par~.
III.112-117), if what Beatrice has just said is true?

	|94-96.~  This passage makes crystal clear what has surely been evident
earlier (most recently at ^Par~. III.31-33, but as early as the second
canto of ^Inferno~, when we see Beatrice through Virgil's eyes, in his
description of her and her "vere parole" [^Inf~. II.135]): The souls of
those in bliss never tell less than the absolute truth.

	|100-108.~  Starting with a general remark, Beatrice attempts to
clarify her position.  Humans frequently do things they know they
should not do, both against their own will and to escape from harm.
The example she adduces, that of Alcmaeon, does not, however, seem to
fulfill the second part of her precise criteria.  Further, Dante seems
to have muddled his version of the story of Alcmaeon, nearly certainly
derived from Statius (^Thebaid~ II.265-305).  (And see also Ovid,
^Metamorphoses~ IX.406-415.)  In Statius, Alcmaeon is the son of
Amphiaraus and Eriphyle; he avenged his father's death by killing his
mother, who, bought off by the gift of a necklace, revealed
Amphiaraus's hiding place to those who wanted to take him into battle
with them and, because of her intervention, succeeded in doing so (see
^Purg~. XII.49-51 [and note]).  Dante's claim that Amphiaraus, the
first of the heroes to die in the war over Thebes (see ^Inf~ .
XX.31-36), asked his son to avenge him is not correct.  As Bosco/Reggio
are apparently alone in pointing out, Amphiaraus does hope for such
revenge as he lies dying on the field of battle (^Theb~. VII.787-788),
but Alcmaeon, not knowing this, commits the horrible deed urged on only
by his own sense of justice.  Beatrice's condition concerning the
commission of an act against one's own will is perhaps, if only with a
fairly broad sense of congruence, met by this example; but it is surely
difficult to understand how the young man acted out of fear of harm to
himself.  Is it possible that Dante knew some other version of this
material?  It seems possible that two lines of Ovid may have caught his
eye, as several commentators have urged; indeed, the brief
recapitulation of these details in ^Metamorphoses~ IX.407-408 may allow
for such a reading, even if it does not mean to: "ultusque parente
parentem / natus erit facto pius et sceleratus eodem" (and his son
[Alcmaeon] shall avenge parent [Amphiaraus] on parent [Eriphyle],
filial and accursed in the selfsame act -- tr. F. J. Miller).  It seems
possible that Dante's "piet@a... spietato" of verse 105 reflects Ovid's
"pius et sceleratus."  But how could Dante have forgotten the clear
indication in Statius (in no way contradicted by Ovid's earlier version
of this material, by the way) that Alcmaeon killed his mother on his
own initiative, no matter how ^pius~ he may have considered himself?
(For similar concerns about families and wrongful death, see ^Paradiso~
V.64-72 and the accompanying note.)

Beatrice's description, in any case, does fit Piccarda's tale
perfectly.  She did something she did not want to do (leaving her
convent) and did not return from fear of what might be done to her if
she tried to -- at least that is what Dante would seem to want us to
believe.

For a consideration of the possible implications of the repetition here
(at vv. 104, 106, 108) of the rhyme words (^spense~, ^pense~,  ^
offense~) found earlier at ^Inferno~ V.107-111 and ^Purgatorio~
XXXI.8-12, see Maria Laura Palermi ("'A questo punto voglio che tu
pense.' Nota di lettura intorno ad una serie rimica della ^Commedia~,"
^Critica del testo~ 5 [2002]: 569-93).

	|109-114.~  Beatrice's distinction is between the absolute will (the
Latin term, ^absoluta voluntas~, reflects its root in the verb
^absolvere~, to release from obligation) and another will, unnamed,
that theologians refer to as the "conditioned" (or "conditional") will,
that is, a will conditioned by circumstance.  "^Assoluta~ here means
'absolute' as contrasted with 'relative.'  Independently of the
circumstances (i.e., of the pressure of fear) the will does not consent
to the wrong forced upon it; but when affected by fear of worse
suffering in case of withdrawing itself from the pressure of that
force, so far it does consent.  So Piccarda, when she speaks of
Constance's life, does not take into account her yielding to fear,
while Beatrice does take it into account, and therefore regards her as
defective in the observance of her vows. Thus both their statements are
true" (Tozer to vv. 109-114).  For example, one wants desperately to
stop smoking but, like Svevo's Zeno, continually yields to the abysmal
need to smoke one last cigarette.  Piccarda's absolute will was always
to desire the life of her convent; her conditioned will was to accept
the marriage to which she was forced.  And thus there is no
contradiction between what she says of herself and what Beatrice
describes as a blameworthy failure in her vows.  They are speaking of
two differing aspects of willing.

	|115-116.~  In a poem controlled by large metaphoric constructs (e.g.,
light, road, forest, mountain, sea, ship, wings, city, tree, plant,
beast, etc.), the third ^cantica~ nonetheless stands out for its
metaphoric exertions.  The last developed metaphor in a canto that
began by studying the justification for metaphor, this passage (and
many another after it) shows Dante's determination to up the "poetic
ante" for his reader, asked to follow a difficult mind, setting about
its work giving expression to theological/philosophical concepts in
emotionally charged lyric language.  On the subject of metaphor in
Dante (far less visited than the related topic of simile), see at least
Ezio Raimondi ("Ontologia della metafora dantesca," ^Letture classensi~
15 [1986]: 99-109) and Emilio Pasquini ("Le icone parentali nella
^Commedia~," ^Letture classensi~ 25 [1996]: 39-50 and ^Dante e le
figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori,
2001], pp. 179-217).

This particular metaphor has furnished the opening of ^Purgatorio~ XXI
with its biblical material, the water of life that Jesus offers the
Samaritan woman.  And here it is Beatrice who is equated with Jesus,
bringing the source of that water to humankind.

	|118-138.~  Dante's lengthy and flowery expression of his gratitude to
Beatrice for her explanation and of his humility before God's mysteries
serves as ^captatio benevolentiae~ in disposing Beatrice to answer
still one more question - not that she requires any such suasion.  Once
again, the needs of the poem come first.  Dante could have written much
less, along the lines of the following: "Of course there was no need
for me to tell / how much I owed to her for saying that / and how much
I owed for 'scaping Hell."  But the poem would have suffered
considerable diminution thereby.

	|122.~  Dante addresses Beatrice with the respectful ^voi~, as he will
also do at verse 134; but see the note to vv. 136-138.

	|130-132.~  Tozer (comm. to this tercet) explains this difficult text
as follows: "'owing to this desire of knowing the Divine Verity, doubt
arises at the foot of truth as saplings rise from the foot of a tree.'
^Appi@e del vero~: this is another way of saying that it springs from
the root of truth, that idea being suggested by the metaphor: the doubt
is a germ of truth.  ^@e natura~, &c.: 'it is a natural process, which
impels us from height to height unto the summit.'  By the questions
which arise from learning a truth, we are led on to the apprehension of
a higher truth, and so onwards till the highest is reached."

	|136-138.~  Dante's third question will be the subject of the first
eighty-four verses of the following canto.  Thus all of the present
canto and over half of the next is devoted to three questions
concerning the freedom of the will, the most important issue
confronting a moralizing Christian writer.  It is probably not
accidental that Dante chose to put this discussion here, in the first
sphere, that of the Moon, reflecting the fact that the first three
realms of the heavens present saved souls whose virtues were
unmistakably marred by significant defect (see the note to ^Par~.
III.47-49).  Most of ^Paradiso~ is concerned with the correction and
perfection of Dante's intellect.  Its beginning offers a chance to
re-engage with the world of moral choice, so inviting to a writer who
never gave up his engagement with the affairs of humankind in this life.

The two uses of plural second-person pronouns or adjectives
(^sodisfarvi~, ^vostra~) should probably not be construed as honorific
but as genuine plurals, Dante holding in mind the companions in
blessedness of Piccarda, as Bosco/Reggio suggest (comm. to verse 138).
Our translation follows this understanding, which is dominant in the
commentary tradition.  Nonetheless, it also seems reasonable to believe
that the protagonist, covering over what is really most on his mind
(see the note to ^Par~. IV.139-142), wants to preserve the ambiguity
that the immediately preceding uses of the honorific ^voi~ for Beatrice
establish, an ambiguity underlined by the proximity and formal
similarity (they are rhyme words, both composed of infinitives plus an
enclitic pronoun) of the two pivotal uses, ^dimandarvi~ and
^sodisfarvi~ at vv. 134 and 136.  Further, the somewhat stilted diction
of the tercet may portray a certain understandable anxiety (e.g., "io
vo' saper se l'uom pu@o sodisfarvi" [I would like to know if one can
satisfy your court]).  And thus ^vi~ and ^vostra~ are not honorific,
but remind us, because of their proximity to those preceding and
undoubted honorifics, that they might as well be.

	|139-142.~  This passage offers a variant on the theme of blindness
already present in this canto in the reference to Tobias in verse 48
(and see the note to that verse) and reworked in Canto XXVI.12, with
its reference to Ananias's restoration of Saul's sight.  There
Beatrice's increasingly evident power completely (if only temporarily)
destroys his power of sight; here Dante is weakened by Beatrice's
overpowering glance, his eyes so overcome that they, in a trope
developed from military behavior, are temporarily routed by the
Beatricean ocular "army."  Most unmilitary, Dante nearly faints, as he
did, for very different reasons, at the conclusions of ^Inferno~ III
and V.  One of the few commentators to respond to the various
provocations of this passage with some alertness is Aversano (^Dante
daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the
author on 11 September 2001, p. 21), who notes that this is the first
time in ^Paradiso~ that Dante must lower his eyes and suggests that
this response represents "un ultimo cenno a tendenze ereticali" (a
final gesture toward his heretical tendencies), going on to relate
these to Gregory the Great's excursus on Proverbs 30:13 (in ^PL~
LXXV.511).

A possible reason for the poet's desire to underline the protagonist's
guilty feelings about Beatrice comes from the context we have just now
entered, his first enunciation (see ^Par~. IV.136-138) of his question
(see Beatrice's rephrasing of it in the following canto (^Par~.
V.13-15) about the possibility of redemption for broken vows.  We do
know that Dante had made at least one vow that, until he wrote the
^Commedia~, he had spectacularly failed to fulfill.  At the conclusion
of the ^Vita nuova~ (XLII.2) he had made a solemn promise: "S@i che, se
piacere sar@a  di colui a cui tutte le cose vivono, che la mia vita
duri per alquanti anni, io spero di dicer di lei quello che mai non fue
detto d'alcuna" (Accordingly, if it be the pleasure of Him through whom
all things live that my life continue for a few more years, I hope to
write of her that which has never been written of any other woman [tr.
M. Musa]).

And so, while Bosco/Reggio (comm. verse 138) are probably correct that
Dante's question is meant to be understood as being addressed formally
to all in bliss with Piccarda (and see Tommaseo [comm. vv. 136-138],
citing verse 67, where Beatrice mentions "la nostra giustizia" [our
justice] in much the same context), the earlier addresses to Beatrice
(vv. 122, 134) stay in our ears and cause a certain ambiguity.  Is
Dante still addressing his ^guida~ or is he pondering the opinion of
the saints?  This is perhaps a case of Dante trying to hide behind the
mask of a more general appeal: "Do you all up here know if mortals are
allowed to make broken vows good by substituting other things for
them?"  That is preferable to asking Beatrice if God can ever forgive
his not making good the vow he made to honor her at the end of the
^Vita nuova~, only to write ^Convivio~ instead, a work in which she is
abandoned for the Lady Philosophy.  Dante, hidden behind that
impersonal formulation (delivered by that noun used as a pronoun,
^l'uom~ [one]), wonders whether or not he might still make amends for
his broken promise with this poem in Beatrice's honor.  Such a decision
is not in the lap of these "gods," in fact, but belongs to the Father.
He has obviously decided in favor of the claimant, otherwise the voyage
would not have been granted him.

In Cantos III and IV Dante offers up a kind of apology for his earlier
^Convivio~, having in it offended Christian truth both with regard to
his Platonic view of the function of the stars in their influence on
human souls and with regard to his broken vow to Beatrice at the end of
^Vita nuova~, the result of his raising the ^donna gentile~ higher in
his praises.
