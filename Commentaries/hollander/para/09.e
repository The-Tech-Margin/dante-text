	|1-6.~  For a fair-minded consideration of this passage, of which it
may seem difficult to form a definitive opinion, see Oelsner's gloss
(comm. to these tercets): "On his death [Charles'] son, Caroberto,
became heir to the throne of Naples; but his uncle Robert (known as
Robert the Wise), supported by Charles II's will, ousted him from the
succession.  This was in 1309.  At the date of the vision, therefore,
Robert could not yet have been abusing his powers as king; but
according to Charles (^Par~. VIII.76), he was already preparing to do
so by cultivating the Spanish friendships he had formed when a hostage
in Spain, and so laying the train for oppression of the much enduring
Apulia by the instrumentality of Spanish favourites."

About the identity of "Clemence" in verse 1 there has been controversy.
 Nonetheless, it would seem most natural to assume that the reference
is to Charles' wife.  (Aversano [^Dante daccapo~ {glosses to the
^Paradiso~}, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001, pp. 37-38] adduces the negative but inviting evidence that, as is
underlined by the last word of the canto, ^avoltero~ [lit.,
"adultery"], the other lovers we encounter in ^Par~. IX [Cunizza,
Folco, Rahab] are all characterized by illicit sexuality.)  Oelsner
continues: "It was her son Caroberto that Robert of Naples had excluded
from the succession to Naples and Provence; and to her and her son,
therefore, the 'vostri danni' of line 6 would naturally apply.  But the
date of her death is given in recent commentaries as 1301, long before
the time at which these words were written; and evidence has now been
produced to show that she really died in 1295, as indeed several of the
early commentators declare; and in that case she had been dead some
years before the assumed date of the vision, 1300.  This would make the
direct address to her in line 1 difficult, and the implied
communication in lines 2-6 well nigh impossible.  And yet the only
alternative seems still more difficult to accept, namely, that the
Clemence addressed was Charles' daughter who married Louis X, ^le
Hutin~ (cf. Villani, IX.66), and was living in 1328.  This Clemence was
in no special way wronged by the proceedings of Robert, nor is it
easily conceivable that Dante in speaking of a father to a daughter
would call him 'thy Charles.'  The reader must take his choice between
these two impossibilities."  Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that
the intimacy of that familiar "tuo" at least implies relationship
(Dante had once seen Charles' Clemenza, according to Chimenz [comm. to
verse 1], in 1281, when she was thirteen, on her way to Naples, but had
no dealings of any kind with his daughter, married to the King of
France.)  In addition, the plural "vostri" refers to Clemenza ("tu")
and at least one other, most likely Caroberto.  Chimenz (comm. to vv.
5-6) finds this last piece of evidence decisive, referring to those who
actually lost something to the political chicanery.

However, perhaps the single most convincing piece of negative evidence
deals with the detail that led to the objection that there is something
odd or impossible in Dante's addressing Charles' dead wife.  Against
this frequently offered objection, Porena (comm. to vv. 1-3) indicates
that Dante frequently apostrophizes the dead, e.g., Constantine (^Inf~.
XIX.115), Saul (^Purg~. XII.40), Rehoboam (^Purg~. XII.46),
Buondelmonte (^Par~. XVI.140).  Fernando Coletti ("Canto IX," in
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1968], pp. 302-3n.) offers a review of the problem, as does
Giuliano Innamorati ("Canto IX," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1987}], pp.
187-91); both of them offer sound arguments for believing the reference
is to Charles' wife, or at least not to his daughter.  Innamorati
offers properly scathing response to Gmelin's notion (^Kommentar: das
Paradies~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1957], ^ad loc~.), advanced perhaps
slightly earlier by P$ezard, who is generally credited with the idea
(at times with agreement) that the spousal Clemenza is addressed by
Dante because she is present with Charles in Venus, a perhaps charming
notion (Innamorati does not think so, finding it, instead, vulgar), but
nearly surely pure invention (see Andr$e P$ezard, "Il canto VIII del
^Paradiso~," in ^Letture dantesche. III. "Paradiso,"~ ed. G. Getto
[Florence: Sansoni, 1964 {1953}], pp. 1489-514).  Palma di Cesnola
(^Semiotica dantesca: Profetismo e diacronia~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1995],
pp. 39-40), arguing for Dante's reference to Clemenza the daughter,
misunderstands one element in the passage, thinking that Dante refers
to a conversation he had had with Charles in Florence in 1294 rather
than the one that he had just now concluded (1300 in Venus).

As Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], p. 268)
points out, this is one of the very few examples of "forbidden
revelations" in the ^Commedia~.

	|7.~  This is the first appearance of the word ^vita~ when it has the
meaning "living soul" in the poem.  It is used 23 times in ^Inferno~
with its usual meaning ("life," in various senses), and then 24 times
in ^Purgatorio~.  In ^Paradiso~ it is used 32 times in all, but, to
indicate a soul in grace, only here (of Charles) and then of five other
denizens of Heaven, as follows: ^Paradiso~ XII.127 (Bonaventura), XIV.6
(Thomas), XX.100 (Trajan), XXI.55 (Peter Damian), and XXV.29 (James).
Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame
University Press, 2005], p. 242, n. 5) is simply incorrect when he
states that the "same term 'vita' is used throughout the ^Comedy~ to
define the human soul."

	|8-9.~  As we will learn in vv. 95-96, Folco is swathed in the light of
his glory, as a saved soul.  Here Charles turns to God (metaphorically,
the Sun), the source of his own brightness; if you are filled with that
light, there is no need of anything else.

	|10-12.~ [The reader should know that this passage represents a
totally different treatment of the tercet than the one originally found
in online versions of these notes (that is, in both the DDP and in the
Princeton Dante Project). The printed versions (Doubleday/Anchor 2003
and 2004) perforce still maintain the erroneous notion that this passage
is an address to the reader.] It is not one, as I should have realized,
at least on the models of ^Purgatorio~ X.121-129 ("O superbi cristian,
miseri lassi") and ^Purgatorio~ XIV.148-150 ("Ma voi prendete l'esca"),
two other examples of direct address, the first to prideful Christians
and the second to foolish mortals in general, that are not and should
not be considered as specifically addressed to readers of the poem.

For the vexed question of exactly whom the poet addresses, see the
preceding note. It is these familiar enemies of Charles Martel who are
excoriated here. If indeed it is possible that some of these might well
have become readers of this poem, it is nonetheless impossible to believe
that Dante here considered them, as in other instances of his use of this
rhetorical technique, his readers. [^Mea culpa.~ (Note added 24 August 2013.)]

	|12.~  The rhyme position is possibly the cause of Dante's choice of
^tempie~ (literally, "temples," but here, in metonymy, "head").
Indeed, half of the six uses of the word in the poem occur in rhymes.

	|13.~  To mark the change in personnel, or scene, Dante uses once again
(and for the twentieth time) the formulaic ^ed ecco~.  Cf. ^Inferno~
I.31; III.82; XIII.115; XVII.1; XXIV.97; XXXIV.20; ^Purgatorio~ II.13;
II.119; III.62; X.100; XIII.35; XIV.137; XV.142; XXI.7; XXIII.10;
XXIII.40; XXVIII.25; XXIX.16; ^Paradiso~ V.105; here (IX.13); XIV.67;
XXIII.19.

	|14-15.~  The increasing brightness of the living soul of Cunizza, as
yet unidentified, signifies that she will gladly answer Dante's
questions, in order to please him.

	|18.~  That is, his desire to speak with this living soul.

	|19.~  Literally, let my desire have its "counterweight" (^compenso~),
i.e., and thus be brought back into balance.

	|21.~  That is, show me that you can read my thoughts because you are
saved.

	|23.~  In the last canto (^Par~. VIII.29) the souls were singing
"Hosanna" from within their light.  Here this one speaks from within as
well.

	|25-36.~  This is the first part of the ample speech (vv. 25-63)  given
by Cunizza da Romano; it is devoted to her brother and to herself.
(The second part, vv. 37-42, serves to introduce the second speaker of
the canto, Folco of Marseilles, while the third and longest part, vv.
43-63, is devoted to the troubles that the March of Treviso soon shall
experience.)  Cunizza (1198-1279 ca.), after a long life of love
affairs (Jacopo della Lana says that she was in love at every stage of
her life [comm. to vv. 32-33]), came to Florence in April of 1265 and
signed a notarial document freeing her family slaves in the house of
Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti (seen in ^Inf~. X), father of Dante's friend
Guido.  She was still alive in 1279, and probably died soon after that.

See Franco Masciandaro ("Appunti sul paesaggio dantesco [^Inferno~ V,
XXVI, e ^Paradiso~ IX]," in ^The Craft and the Fury: Essays in Memory
of Glauco Cambon~, ed. J. Francese [West Lafayette, Indiana: Bordighera
Press, 2000], pp. 118-19) for Cunizza as correctively mirroring
Francesca, and their surrounding landscapes as mirroring their inner
states.

	|25-28.~  Tozer (comm. to vv. 25-28): "The place of which Dante speaks
in line 28 as situated on a low hill is the castle of Romano, the
patrimony of the Ezzelini.  The exact position of this spot is not
known, but the part of Italy which is here described as situated
between Rialto and the 'fountains' of the Brenta and the Piave is the
Marca Trivigiana, which lay between Venice (here represented by the
island of Rialto) and the neighbouring part of the Alps, in which those
two rivers rise."  Ezzelino da Romano (1194-1259) was a Ghibelline
leader, famed for his oppressive ways.  "Ezzelino, whose lordship over
the March of Treviso lasted for more than thirty years, was a ruthless
and bloodthirsty tyrant, and was guilty of the most inhuman
atrocities....  In 1255 Pope Alexander IV proclaimed a crusade against
Ezzelino, styling him 'a son of perdition, a man of blood, the most
inhuman of the children of men, who, by his infamous torture of the
nobles and massacre of the people, has broken every bond of human
society, and violated every law of Christian liberty.'  After a war of
three years' duration, in the course of which he committed the most
terrible atrocities, Ezzelino was finally defeated (Sept. 16, 1259) by
the marquis of Este at Cassano, where he was desperately wounded and
taken prisoner.  Eleven days after, having torn open his wounds, he
died in his prison at Soncino, at the age of 64, after a reign of
thirty-four years" (Toynbee, "Ezzelino" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).
See Erminia Maria Dispenza Crimi, "Ezzelino III da Romano, 'modello di
affidamento' del personaggio di Cangrande della Scala," an Appendix to
her book (^"Cortesia" e "Valore" dalla tradizione a Dante~ [Rovito:
Marra, 1993], pp. 127-136), for the anti-Guelph activities of these two
Ghibelline leaders.

	|29-30.~  We have seen Ezzelino briefly (with his menacing black hair)
in ^Inferno~ XII.109-110.  Pietro di Dante tells the following anecdote
about him (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 31-33): "When his mother was close to
parturition, she had a dream that she was giving birth to a flaming
torch ^(facem igneam)~ that was setting afire the entire area of the
March of Treviso."

In fact, it may be Ezzelino who is responsible for his sister's
presence in ^Paradiso~, if only because he was the subject of Albertino
Mussato's ^Ecerinis~, the first Senecan tragedy written in the
post-classical age, which, along with his historical account of Henry
VII, was the reason for his receiving the laurel in a tumultuous
ceremony at Padua at Christmas 1315.  Padua was in many respects the
most advanced center for the birth of early forms of humanism in Italy.
 The exchange of Latin verse serving as letters between Giovanni del
Virgilio and Dante (ca. 1320) included an invitation to Dante to write
a Latin poem about major Italian political figures and then to come to
Bologna for his laureation, an offer clearly counting on Dante's
emulous feelings toward Mussato (1261-1329) and desire to be laureated
himself, as Dante comes close to admitting in the opening lines of
^Paradiso~ XXV.  For what had been a neglected aspect of Dante's
relationship with other writers, see Manlio Pastore Stocchi ("Dante,
Mussato, e la traged@ia," in ^Dante e la cultura veneta~, ed. V. Branca
and G. Padoan [Florence: Olschki, 1966], pp. 251-62) and Ezio Raimondi
("Dante e il mondo ezzeliniano," ^ibid~., pp. 51-69).  See also
Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~
[Ravenna: Longo, 1980], p. 116n.).  The first points to several
passages in Dante, including the ^Epistle to Cangrande~, which perhaps
ought to be considered polemical against the never-mentioned Mussato.
Raimondi, on the other hand, indicates several passages in Mussato,
including a brief account of a dream of the afterworld that he had in
Florence that was caused, it turns out, by stomach problems, a fairly
obvious shot at the rival whom he, like that rival, never names.  And
see Girolamo Arnaldi ("La Marca Trevigiana 'prima che Federigo avesse
briga', e dopo," in ^Dante e la cultura veneta~, ed. V. Branca and G.
Padoan [Florence: Olschki, 1966], pp. 29-37) for more on the differing
reactions to Cunizza and Ezzelino on the part of Mussato and of Dante.
For the state of the question in 1970, see Guido Martellotti, "Mussato,
Albertino," ^ED~ III (1970).  While Martellotti admits that there is no
hard evidence connecting these two writers (p. 1068a), he suggests that
verses 25-33 are possibly a sly attack on Mussato (p. 1067b).  It may
seem that Dante and Mussato had no cause for mutual dislike.  Both were
champions of Henry VII (of whom Mussato was the historian of his
Italian activities).  But Mussato despised the Scaligeri, and
especially Cangrande.  In fact, in an event almost certainly referred
to in vv. 46-48, the battle at Vicenza in September 1314, not only was
Mussato present to fight against Cangrande, he was taken prisoner by
that lord (see Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 46-48]: "multi capti sunt,... et
Mussatus poeta" [many were captured,... including the poet Mussato])
and brought back to Verona, where he was treated less like a prisoner
than an honored guest.  One story that circulated had it that when
Cangrande, impressed by Mussato's bravery in battle (he was wounded
several times and yet, in his desire to avoid capture, leaped into the
castle moat, out of which he was pulled by Cangrande's troops), came to
see him in his comfortable quarters in the Scaliger castle, which
served as his dungeon, and asked whether he could have a few words with
his prisoner, Mussato replied that surely he might, but only if he were
able to converse in Latin.  We do not know how long Mussato was held
prisoner in Verona, but not for very long, one supposes.  We do know
that Dante was a resident of that castle at this period.  It would seem
inconceivable that Mussato was not much on Cangrande's mind and tongue.
 One can imagine Dante having to listen to his patron's lavish praise
of this "other poet" who was "given the laurel," who was such a great
Latinist, and who had put up such a brave fight in combat.  It must
have been galling.

Edoardo Fumagalli ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], pp. 395-403) deserves credit for bringing some of this
material back into play in his reading of ^Paradiso~ XXV.  He ties
together Dante's responsive eclogue to Giovanni del Virgilio, his
reaction to Mussato's laureation in 1315, and the opening passages of
this last ^cantica~.

Torraca (comm. to vv. 28-30) points out that Dante strips Ezzelino of
the demonic paternity that Mussato provides him in his tragedy, in the
opening lines of which his mother allows that his father was a
fire-breathing monster.

As Bosco/Reggio remark (introductory note to this canto), the ninth
canto of ^Paradiso~ is more datable than most, since it refers to a
number of events that occurred in 1314 and 1315.  Thus it may have been
written hot on the heels of the news of Mussato's laureation at the
close of 1315.  If the original plan for the canto called for the
presence of Folco alone, perhaps including his presentation of Rahab,
Dante may have decided to add another woman (it is a rare canto in the
^Commedia~ that has two women in starring or major supporting roles;
only ^Paradiso~ III, with Piccarda and Constance, comes to mind)
because Cunizza offered Dante a way to address the question of Mussato
through her brother (who enjoys brief enough treatment here, but
several lines more than he receives in ^Inferno~ XII).

	|31-33.~  Cunizza now identifies herself both as the sister of the
"firebrand" and as, in the words Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv.
13-15), "recte filia Veneris" (indeed a daughter of Venus).  The words
she uses to do so might suggest that she dwells permanently in this
planet, as Pompeo Venturi (comm. to vv. 32-33) seems to believe.  (For
a later instance in the canto which seems indeed to indicate that Rahab
was "assumed" by Venus, see the note to vv. 119-123.)

It has been difficult for commentators to accept Dante's salvation of
Cunizza.  Some show their hostile disbelief (she was, according to
Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 31-36], "widely known to be a whore" [^famosa
meretrix~], but he goes on to find her youthful conduct excusable [he
does not mention her mature amorous adventures]).  ^Meretrix~ was a
label affixed to her on a half dozen other occasions (deriving from an
unpublished early commentary), while others attempt to put forward the
unbelievable claim that she only affected the manner of carnal lovers.
For the amply documented list of Cunizza's various love affairs and
marriages, including a famous fling during her first marriage with the
poet Sordello, see Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 32-33) and Baranski
("'Sordellus... qui... patrium vulgare deseruit': A Note on ^De vulgari
eloquentia~, I, 15, sections 2-6," in ^The Cultural Heritage of the
Italian Renaissance: Essays in Honour of T. G. Griffith~, ed. C. E. J.
Griffiths and R. Hastings [Lewiston, N.Y.: Edwin Mellen Press, 1993],
pp. 19-45). ^~ (Sordello names himself at ^Purg~. VI.74 but is present
in the poem during four cantos, until the protagonist goes to sleep at
the beginning of Canto IX.)  To Daniele Mattalia (comm. to verse 32)
she is a modern version of Rahab (but what service she performed for
Church or state he does not say); however, Mattalia (comm. to verse 32)
is apparently the only commentator before the seventh centenary
observations in 1965 to face the question of the relation of the
present situation of Cunizza in the afterworld to her eternal one, and
he sees that they are different (what Dante would consider a correct
view), but he then goes on to make a further distinction unwarranted by
the text: she will be in the same rank in the Empyrean as Venus is in
the heavens, i.e., "in the third level of merit/happiness
(^merito-felicit@a~)."  Again, see the note to vv. 119-123.

	|31.~  Cunizza's formulation, once we consider that one sibling is seen
by Dante in Hell while the other addresses him from this planet, is
surely meant to remind us of the remark of Charles Martel about the
differing natures of members of the same family (Esau and Jacob) in the
last canto (VIII.130-131).

	|34-36.~  Cunizza is saying that she no longer begrudges herself her
sins because she neither feels the impulse that led to them nor the
remorse that followed them (both in the world and in Purgatory), which
were washed away by Lethe.  See the similar view of Francesco da Buti
(comm. to vv. 25-36), dealing with the notion that Dante is
contradicting himself when he presents Cunizza as remembering her sins.
 Folco will state the proposition a little more clearly than she does
in vv. 103-104: "here we don't repent, but smile instead, / not at our
fault, which comes not back to mind" but at God's Providence, that
foresaw the sin and its redemption.  The "common herd" will not
understand that she is not racked by penitential thoughts of her sins.

	|37.~  Cunizza indicates Folco di Marsiglia, who will follow her in
speaking to Dante at verse 82.

	|38-42.~  Dante would seem to hold to two positions, one "orthodox" in
its condemnation of vainglory (see ^Purg~. XI.100-102, where fame in
the world is but a "gust of wind," variable and of short durance) and
one less so, if still more or less welcome in a Christian universe,
acceptance of renown for the performance of good deeds.  While the
commentators are not of one opinion, it seems likely that Dante is not
speaking of the vain sort of fame, but of the second sort.  See the
even stronger positive evaluation of such renown in ^Paradiso~
XVIII.31-33, that enjoyed by the last souls whom Dante observes in the
heaven of Mars, those who in the world made such a mark "that any
poet's page would be enriched" by containing their names.  See also
^Inferno~ IV.76-78, where we are presented with the (strange)
information that the renown of non-believers in Limbo somehow
"advances" their cause with God.

	|40.~  Most readers take this line as we do, i.e., this century marker
shall occur five more times before Folco's fame dies down.  There was
apparently a tradition, if it is referred to derisively by St.
Augustine (^Enarr. in Ps.~ 6.1), that the history of humankind, from
Adam until Judgment Day, would last 7,000 years.  That would, according
to Dante's timeline, make human history on this earth extend roughly to
the year 1800, since 6498 years have passed since God formed Adam (see
^Par~. XXVI.118-123).  Vellutello, however, objects to the widely
shared interpretation of ^s'incinqua~, arguing (comm. to vv. 37-42)
that the verse actually means that the number of the century shall be
"fived," i.e., as it shall be in the year 1500.  Only a few have
followed his lead.  Yet the reader should probably also consider
another probably misguided theory, reported by Scartazzini (comm. to
this verse), who severely disapproves, as having been embraced first by
L.G. Blanc.  It was then advanced soon after the end of the First World
War by Rodolfo Benini (^Dante tra gli splendori dei suoi enigmi
risolti~ [Rome: Sampaolesi, 1952 {1919}], p. 64) and was more recently
referred to approvingly by Silvio Pasquazi ("Il Canto IX," in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989], pp. 283-84).  This understanding has it that one needs,
not to add five centuries to thirteen hundred to reach 1800, but to
multiply 1300 times 5 to reach 6500.  Benini and Pasquazi believe that
this is a propitious number because 6500 years have already passed
since Adam and Eve were formed (see the note to ^Par~. XXVI.118-120,
where 6498 years have passed between then and "now," the year 1300),
thus making a total of 13,000 years, or, according to one medieval
tradition, a "Great Year" (see the last paragraph of the note to ^Inf~.
I.1), one considerably shorter than Plato's 36,000-year one, obliquely
but clearly referred to by Dante in ^Convivio~ II.v.16.  Barbi (rev. of
Vincenzo Russo, ^La fama di Folco di Marsiglia e la fine del mondo~
[Catania: Monago e Mollica, 1902], in ^Bulletino della Societ@a
Dantesca Italiana~ 10 [1903]: 52) reports that Russo refers to St.
Augustine's view that the world will end seven millennia after the
creation of Adam.  What Augustine actually says is that those who
assert this cannot possibly know what is known to God the Father alone.
 Professor James O'Donnell showed the way (in an e-mail message of 16
August 2005) to the relevant passage (^Enarr. Ps.~ 6.1): "Qui adventus,
computatis annis ab Adam, post septem annorum millia futurus creditur;
ut septem annorum millia tanquam septem dies transeant, deinde illud
tempus tanquam dies octavus adveniat" (Which coming [the Day of
Judgment], counting the years since Adam, it is believed will occur
after seven thousand years, so that if seven thousand years go by as
seven days, then that time shall arrive as the eighth day).  The sixth
Psalm's rubric, in the Vulgate, refers to the octave (Psalms 4-6 are
all addressed by David to the chief musician of the Temple); the "seven
days" evidently refer to the days of Creation, become the archetype of
the seven millennia of human history; the number eight has a long
history as the number of baptism, and hence of rebirth of the Christian
child (e.g., the octagonal shape of baptismal fonts).  Whether in
denial or not, Augustine's words put into play the concept that Dante
may be borrowing here, and do so in a work that, if not discussed as
being important to Dante (in standard sources, neither by Moore
[^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in
Dante~ {Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]}] nor in the entry "Agostino" by
Alberto Pincherle [^ED~ I {1970}]), he nonetheless was well acquainted
with it, as is becoming ever more clear (see, e.g., Mazzoni ["Un
incontro di Dante con l'esegesi biblica (A proposito di ^Purg~. XXX,
85-99)," in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki,
1988], pp. 207-12).  For Dante's own previous sense of the temporal
location of the end of the world, see ^Convivio~ II.xiv.11-13.  There
he discusses "... the almost imperceptible movement which [the starry
heaven] makes from west to east at the rate of one degree in a hundred
years....  [T]his revolution had a beginning and shall have no end....
For since the beginning of the world [the Starry Heaven] has completed
little more than one-sixth of the revolution, and yet we are already in
the last age of the world and are still awaiting the consummation of
the celestial movement" (tr. R. Lansing).  One-sixth of the revolution
of the stars would be 6,000 years.  A "little more" could be roughly
five hundred years, approximately 1.5% of that number, bringing the
total years since the creation of Adam to 6500 (for Dante, as we have
seen, 6498).  If we accept Russo's reading, as do Steiner (comm. to vv.
39-40) and Giacalone (comm. to vv. 39-40 [without mention of his
precursors]), it would have us believe that Folco's fame on earth will
last, literally, for the rest of time (i.e., 6500 plus 500).  And when
we consider that it is not his poems (never referred to during his
presence here), but his turning to the religious life, which included
his persecution of the Albigensians, that will give him such positive
and lasting renown, some may not be too eager to accept the hypothesis.
 His positive renown for such deeds until the end of time would be
appalling to one who shared John Carroll's opinion of Dante's salvation
of Folco (see his comm. to vv. 106-108).  For a generic rebuke to such
"soft" views, see Mark Balfour ("^Paradiso~ IX," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995],  p. 138): "Those who would characterize
the Albigensian Crusade as somehow being a perversion of the crusading
ideal are largely subscribing to an anachronistic viewpoint."
Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 37-42) tries to move Dante from an
error to dubious taste, suggesting that before even the fourteenth
century had its end, Folco enjoyed no fame at all, even in his own
city, going on to suggest, in one of this great commentator's flightier
moments, that Dante is actually using coded speech to foretell his own
lasting fame.

	|41.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 39)
contrasts this use of the word ^eccellente~ with the ^eccellenza~ of
^Purgatorio~ XI.87, where it has the clear sense of a need to excel
based on pride.  Here (if not all the commentators are in accord with
this view), it clearly refers to extraordinary goodness, which lives on
after one has died, forming a model for others to follow.  St. Francis,
for example, had exactly this effect on the world, galvanizing
countless people to set their lives to doing good.

	|43-45.~  The current inhabitants of the Marca Trivigiana -- its
confines traced (to the west) by the Tagliamento and (to the east) by
the Adige (see Tozer, comm. to this tercet), although they have been
"scourged" by the various tyrants of the region (Ezzelino, his brother
Alberigo, and others) have not, according to Cunizza, learned their
lesson.

	|46-48.~  But they shall learn that lesson, one of obedience to
Cangrande, insisting on his role as imperial vicar even after the death
of Henry VII.  Cunizza first foretells the disastrous defeat of the
Guelph Paduan army in the fall of 1314 in Vicenza, a Ghibelline city
that it had retaken the day before, only to be completely routed in a
surprise attack by a small imperial force led by Cangrande.  For more
on this battle, and the role of Albertino Mussato in it, see the note
to vv. 29-30.  For a lengthy discussion of the nineteenth-century
debate over the incidents referred to in these lines, see Scartazzini
(comm. to this tercet).

	|49-51.~  Next Cunizza prophesies the brutal death of Rizzardo da
Camino, ruler of Treviso (1306-1312).  While playing chess in his own
palace, he was murdered by a peasant wielding a pruning hook.  As he
had married a daughter of Nino Visconti (see ^Purg~. VIII.53) in 1308,
Dante would have probably looked with special disfavor on his notorious
philandering, which may have been the motivating cause for his murder.
As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) point out, Dante nods here in
the present tenses of the verbs in vv. 50-51: Rizzardo was not ruling
the city in 1300, nor was the plot to kill him being hatched in that
year.

The presence of Rizzardo here is perhaps intended to remind the reader
of the high praise lavished upon his father, captain-general of Treviso
(1283-1306), "il buon Gherardo" of ^Purgatorio~ XVI.124.  See also
^Convivio~ IV.xiv.12, with its praise of Gherardo and mention of the
rivers Sile and Cagnano.  Thus we have here another of the examples, so
dear to Dante, of the unpredictability of nobility's being passed on
through the seed of a noble father.  "Good wombs have borne bad sons"
is King Lear's version of this reflection.

	|52-60.~  Finally, Cunizza turns her prophetic attention to Feltro
(Feltre; see ^Inf~. I.105).  Alessandro Novello, a Trevisan, was bishop
of Feltre (1298-1320).  In 1314 he gave three Ferrarese brothers,
Ghibellines, refuge in the city, but then turned them over to the
Guelphs of Ferrara, who cut their heads off.

	|54.~  The word ^malta~ has caused difficulty.  Before Petrocchi, most
texts capitalized it.  (There were at least six prisons in Italy that
bore the name Malta.)  But it is also possible that Dante meant what
Petrocchi thought he did (a generalized sense of "prison").  If,
however, he was referring to a particular place, most recent
discussants prefer the choice of the prison for ecclesiastics situated
in Lake Bolsena.

	|61-63.~  Cunizza concludes her speech by reminding Dante of the actual
location of the angelic order of Thrones, "above," i.e., just below the
Cherubim (and thus third from the highest rank, occupied by the
Seraphim).  For the implicit rebuke to Dante, both here and there, see
the note to ^Paradiso~ VIII.34-39.  Edward Peters ("Human Diversity and
Civil Society in ^Paradiso~ VIII," ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991: 51-70)
points out that Thomas Aquinas associates the order of the Thrones with
theologically correct human governance.

	|63.~  Cunizza is aware that to mortals her three prophecies (vv.
43-60), all of them detailing the just punishment of her "countrymen"
from the Marca Trivigiana, may seem cruel, while to the saved they are
a cause for further celebration of God's justice.

	|64-66.~  As soon as she breaks off her words to Dante (and she has
been speaking quite a while, vv. 25-63), she joins her companions in
dance and, like them, contemplates God.

	|67-68.~  Dante "knew" the next soul from Cunizza's words at vv. 37-42.

	|69.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 67-69) report that the ^balasso~ is a
ruby found in Asia, in Balascam (today Badakhshan, a region including northeastern
Afghanistan and southeastern Tajikistan [see Eric Ormsby, "A mind emparadised,"
^The New Criterion~ 26 {Nov. 2007}: 73f.]), according
to the thirty-fifth chapter of Marco Polo's ^Il milione~.

	|70-72.~  The meaning is fairly clear: Here in Paradise ^(l@a s@u)~ a
living soul, grown more joyful, becomes more refulgent; on earth
^(qui)~, a person, made happier, smiles; in Hell ^(gi@u)~, a damned
soul, caused to feel greater sadness, darkens in its outer aspect.  We
never actually see such change in ^Inferno~.  This is another example
(cf. ^Inf~. XVI.106-108; ^Inf~. XX.127-129) of Dante adding details to
his descriptions of earlier scenes.

	|73-81.~  The protagonist's nine verses indulge in rhetorical flights
and playful reproof.  For "fancy" rhetoric, consider Dante's three
coinages (vv. 73 and 81), which spectacularly turn pronouns into verbs
("to in-him," "to in-you," "to in-me") at either end of his address to
Folco.  And then there is his mock impatience with his interlocutor for
holding his tongue when Folco can surely see, in God, Dante's eagerness
to know his story.  Is this the most "literary" pose we have as yet
watched and heard the protagonist assume?  Whatever its degree of
novelty, it is a delight to observe.

When we look back from ^Paradiso~ XIV.96, we realize that these were
the last words spoken by the protagonist until then.  This is by far
the longest stretch in the poem in which he remains silent, from here
near the end of his stay in Venus, right through his time in the Sun,
until just after his arrival in Mars.

	|75.~  For a consideration of the word ^fuia~, which seems to have
various shades of meaning in its three appearances in the poem (^Inf~.
XII.90 and ^Purg~. XXXIII.44), see Luigi Peirone ("Parole di Dante:
^fuia~," ^L'Alighieri~ 27 [2006]: 151-60).

	|77-78.~  It is probably no accident that Dante speaks here of the
Seraphim, the highest order of angels and associated with the highest
form of affection, spiritual love.  Folco was, after all, a poet of
carnal love, but one who transformed himself into a better kind of
lover when he took orders and then when he became God's flail for
heresy.  Starting with Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 73-79) and the
Ottimo (comm. to vv. 73-78), the early commentators found biblical
sources of the six wings of the Seraphim either in the Apocalypse or in
Ezechiel.  However, beginning with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 77-78), the
consensus had moved to Isaiah 6:2, the only passage specifically naming
them in the Bible: "And above [the Lord's throne] stood the seraphim;
each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he
covered his feet, and with two he did fly."

	|82-93.~  The poet, through the words of Folco, locates the
Mediterranean, the second largest sea on the earth's surface after
Oceanus (verse 84), which surrounds all the land on our globe, on the
map of Europe.  Moving from west to east, Folco makes the Mediterranean
extend 90 degrees in latitude, more than twice its length in modern
cartography.  Folco places his birthplace, the as-yet-unnamed
Marseilles (Vellutello forcefully protests [comm. to vv. 82-87]
against, he says, all the other commentators [but also against Dante],
stating that Folco was actually born in Genova), between the Ebro's
mouth in Spain and that of the Magra in Italy, which separates Liguria
from Tuscany.  Nearly sharing the time of both sunrise and sunset,
Folco continues, his native city and Bougie (on the North African
coast) thus nearly share the same meridian of longitude.  This rebus
leads a patient reader to his city's name.  Carroll (comm. to vv.
82-92), at least in part to excuse the exerted twelve-verse periphrasis
for "I was born in Marseilles," insists that Folco is looking down,
from the epicycle of Venus, with an astronaut's view of the
Mediterranean, and describing what he sees.

	|85.~  For the context offered by the citation of ^Aeneid~ IV.622-629,
see Mark Balfour ("^Paradiso~ IX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995), p. 137.  He points out that IV.628, "litora litoribus
contraria" (shore with opposing shore), recognized by some as the
source of Dante's "tra ' discordanti liti" (between its opposing
shores) is drawn from Dido's penultimate utterance, her curse on Aeneas
and his offspring.  "Dante's allusion to Dido's curse, therefore,
underlines the far-reaching consequences of Aeneas's illicit love, for
the conflict between Islamic East and Christian West is, for Dante, a
continuation of the enmity between Carthage and Rome."
Awareness of this reference is surprisingly limited and no one before
Balfour drew anything like his conclusions.  The only early commentator
to notice the Virgilian provenance of this verse was the Ottimo (comm.
to vv. 82-90).  More than 500 years were to pass before another, the
classicizing Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 85-87), gave the passage a second
chance.  He was followed by Scartazzini, Campi, and only a few others,
including Casini/Barbi and Bosco/Reggio.

	|93.~  For the citation of Lucan here (^Phars~. III.453), see the notes
to ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.101-102 and ^Paradiso~ VI.55-72.

	|94.~  Folchetto di Marsiglia was born ca. 1160 and died in 1231.  His
poems, written in Proven$cal roughly between 1180 and 1195, were known
to Dante, who praises them highly (if the only one referred to is his
canzone "Tan m'abellis l'amoros pensamen" [So greatly does the thought
of love please me]), naming him by his more familiar name as poet
(^Folchetus~ in Latin, which would yield ^Folchetto~ in Italian, as
many indeed do refer to him) in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ II.vi.6.  Dante
"recycles" the opening of the first line of that canzone in the first
line he gives to Arnaut Daniel (^Purg~. XXVI.140, "Tan m'abellis vostre
cortes deman" [So greatly does your courteous question please me]).  At
least several years before 1200, Folchetto left the life of the world
behind (including a wife and two sons), becoming first a friar, then
abbot of Torronet in Toulon, and finally bishop of Toulouse in 1205.
He was deeply involved in a leadership role in the bloody and infamous
Albigensian Crusade (1208-1229).  As Longfellow has it (comm. to this
verse), "The old nightingale became a bird of prey."

One wonders if Dante's use of Folco (rather than Folchetto) for him in
this canto mirrors his sense of the "new man" that eventuated once he
turned from love and amorous poetry to the religious life.  For a
perhaps similar appreciation, if it is not clearly stated, see Alfonso
Bertoldi (^Il canto XII del "Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele"]
[Florence: Sansoni, {1913}], p. 27), noting that St. Dominic was at
Rome in 1216 "in compagnia del vescovo Folco, l'amoroso Folchetto di
Marsiglia...."  On Dante's sense of Folco's two-part "career," see
Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1984], pp. 114-22).

	|95-96.~  Folco's meaning is that the heaven of Venus has its light
increased by the presence of his soul, now wrapped in a sheath of light
because he is saved, just as it once stamped his nature with an amorous
disposition.

	|96.~  While Folchetto's status as poet seems not to be alluded to here
at all, many deal with it as part of the context of his presence,
understandably assuming that Dante is centrally interested in that.
Among those involved in examining the possible Old French and
Proven$cal sources of Dante's poems, Michelangelo Picone has been
particularly active. See, ^inter alia~, his ^"Vita Nuova" e tradizione
romanza~ (Padua: Liviana, 1979); "I trovatori di Dante: Bertran de
Born" (^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~ 19 [1979]: 71-94);

tradizione arturiana" (^Romanische Forschungen~ 94 [1982]: 1-18);

[Milan: Franco Angeli, 1989], pp. 63-86); "Presenze romanzesche nella
^Vita Nuova~" (^Vox Romanica~ 55 [1996]: 1-15); "La carriera del

("Intertestualit@a trobadorico-dantesche," ^Medioevo e Rinascimento~ 11
[1997]: 81-96) for more on Dante's sources in Proven$cal verse.
Opposing the views advanced by Picone (both in "Giraut de Bornelh nella
prospettiva di Dante" and in "^Paradiso~ IX: Dante, Folchetto e la
diaspora trobadorica") and by Rossi ("'E pos d'amor plus no\&middot;m
cal': Ovidian Exemplarity and Folco's Rhetoric of Love in ^Paradiso~
IX," ^Tenso: Bulletin of the Soci$et$e Guilhem IX~ 5 [1989]: 49-102--
also reaffirmed by Antonelli ("^Subsistant igitur ignorantie
sectatores~," in ^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo centenario della morte:
Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo [22-24 aprile 1994]~, ed. M.
Picone [Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995], p. 347) -- Pietro Beltrami
("Arnaut Daniel e la 'bella scola' dei trovatori di Dante," in ^Le
culture di Dante. Atti del quarto Seminario dantesco internazionale~,
ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence: Cesati, 2004], p. 33n.)
argues that Folco is ^not~ to be taken as the highest exponent of
Troubadour lyrics found in the poem, but rather as a poet who has given
over poetry for religion and is saved for that reason alone.  I.e.,
Folco's distinction in Paradise lies in his rejection of poetry, not in
his continued embrace of it.  Cf. the similar opinion of Luca Curti
("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 146): "
...but now [we hear not the troubadour] but only the bishop Folco, in
whose discourse poetry has not even a marginal presence... ."  For a
related point, this time with reference to the chastened poetic
inclinations of Guinizzelli and Arnaut Daniel in ^Purgatorio~ XXVI, see
Claudio Giunta (^La poesia italiana nell'et@a di Dante: la linea
Bonagiunta-Guinizzelli~ [Bologna: Il Mulino, 1998], pp. 56-57).
Stefano Asperti ("Dante, i trovatori, la poesia," in ^Le culture di
Dante. Atti del quarto Seminario dantesco internazionale~, ed.
Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence: Cesati, 2004], pp. 61-92) also
discusses, in a similar vein, Dante's view of the importance of the
conversion of Folco, rather than his poetry, as redeeming him in the
eyes of God (and of Dante).  He sees Dante's turning from the poetry of
human desire to a poetry of the love for God as paralleling Folco's
turning from poetry to the love of God pure and simple.  Asperti (pp.
79n.-80n.) reproduces notice, from a sermon of Robert de Sorbon,
chaplain of King Louis IX, of an occasion on which the penitent Folco,
having heard someone singing one of the songs he had composed in his
pre-monastic life, ingested no more than bread and water for that
entire day (as a form of recognition of his former sinfulness).  See
also Adriana Mastalli's study ("El erotismo como alimento: Cecco
Angiolieri y la negaci$on de la 'Donna Angelicata'," in ^XVIII Congreso
de lengua y literatura italianas: Le candide farine e il rosso vino,~
^12-13-14 setiembre de 2002~ [Asociaci$on de Docentes e Investigadores
de Lengua y Literatura Italianas] [Mendoza, Argentina: Universidad
Nacional de Cuyo, Facultad de Filosof$ia y Letras], pp. 177-86) of
Cecco Angiolieri's rejection of the Guinizzellian tradition of the
^donna angelicata~ and of the ^dolce stil novo~ (p. 178).  Since Cecco
was dead by February 1313, and probably before the phrase was created
or (at least published) by Dante, only the first part of her
formulation is valid, if its essential views seem acceptable.  Cecco's
attacks on Dante reflect the early lyrics and the ^Vita nuova~.  It is,
however, interesting to consider that, from his writings, Folco might
have seemed to Dante as disreputable a figure as Cecco (whom he never
mentions -- this silence being, perhaps, his best revenge), and indeed
not one bound for Heaven.

	|97-102.~  Dido ("the daughter of Belus") was no more aflame with love,
bringing grief to Sychaeus (Dido's dead husband; see ^Aen~. IV.552 and
^Inf~. V.62) and Creusa (Aeneas's dead wife; see ^Aen~.II.736-794 and
the note to ^Purg~. II.79-81) than Folco was.  (However, since the next
two classical lovers are both apparently drawn from Ovid's ^Heroides~,
Dante may be thinking of the portrait of Dido found there [Book VII].)
Nor was Phyllis more in love with Demopho,on, who betrayed her (see
Ovid, ^Heroides~ II); nor was Hercules more in love with Iole (see
Ovid, ^Heroides~ IX).  Paola Allegretti ("Canto IX," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati], p. 142) suggests that Dante wants us to think of
the ^Heroides~ in part because the work insists on the adulterous
nature of most of the loves it recounts, using faithful Penelope as a
counter ^exemplum~ to them.  For Folco's reputation as a lover, see
Antonio Viscardi, "Folchetto (Folco) di Marsiglia," ^ED~ II (1970), p.
955a.

	|103-105.~  The tercet clarifies the similar, but more occluded,
statement of Cunizza (vv. 34-36).  All the pain of sin is utterly
erased from the memory of every saved soul.  On this smile, see Jacoff
("The Post-Palinodic Smile: ^Paradiso~ VIII and IX," ^Dante Studies~ 98
[1980]: 111-22).

	|106-108.~  A problematic passage.  We have followed Bosco/Reggio's
reading of it (see their comm. to this tercet), in which a Florentine
form of the verb ^torniare~ (to turn, as on a lathe) is seen as
bringing the meaning into focus, as follows: "Here, in Paradise, we
contemplate the craft revealed in the creation that God's love makes
beautiful; we also discern the goodness through which the heavens give
form to the world below."

For a lengthy and unapologetic negative response to Dante's saving of
Folco, see the judgment of John S. Carroll (comm. to vv. 82-102), which
concludes as follows: "It certainly gives us a shock to find a noble
spirit like Dante's so subdued to the colour and temper of its time
that deeds which sink Ezzelino to perdition exalt Folco to Paradise,
because done in the name of Christ and authority of His Vicar."

For the other appearance of the phrase "cotanto affetto," see ^Inferno~
V.125, where it applies to carnal affections.  Folco's use of it now is
very different, we may imagine, than it would have been in his flaming
youth.

	|109-114.~  Having read Dante's mind, Folco changes the subject from
himself to the particularly dazzling light ("like a sunbeam gleaming in
clear water") about which he knows Dante is curious.  Once we find out
who it is, we understand why he has tried to create a sense of excited
mystery around this being.

	|115-117.~  The enjambment in the second line of the tercet creates
Dante's desired effect: surprise.  Not only does Rahab's name cause us
(at least temporary) consternation, what Folco goes on to say of her
does also.  Not only is a whore among the saved, she is among the
loftiest souls whom we see here.

Among the first commentators, only the author of the ^Codice cassinese~
(comm. to verse 117) said that by the "highest rank" Dante indicates
the Empyrean, which is what he ^should have~ meant, since none of the
Hebrew (and a very few other) souls saved in the Harrowing of Hell is
anywhere recorded as going anywhere else, not even by Dante.  That
anonymous commentator would wait for nearly five and a half centuries
for company (Torraca in 1905 [comm. to this tercet]).  Torraca also
believes the reference is to the Empyrean.  The passage is, as many
commentators protest, difficult to understand.  Nonetheless, Benvenuto
da Imola (comm. to this tercet) seems quite certain that her highest
"rank" pertains to the hierarchy of the souls gathered in Venus.  Most
of those after him who elect to identify her location also think the
reference is to the planet.  Only in the last one hundred years has the
pendulum of scholarly opinion begun to swing, if only slightly, in the
direction of the Empyrean.  Paola Allegretti ("Canto IX," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 143-44) makes a strong case for
that resolution.  The only problem is that, in the entire passage, all
other references are unquestionably to the sphere of Venus (vv. 113
[^qui~]; 115 [^l@a~]; 116 [^a nostr' ordine congiunta~]; 118-120
[^questo cielo~... ^fu assunta~]; 122 [^in alcun cielo~]).  And so it
would seem that this is yet another instance of an authorial slip (see
the note to vv. 119-123).

	|118-119.~  The point at which ends the shadow of the earth cast by the
Sun, a cone stretching nearly 900,000 miles above the earth according
to Alfraganus, reaches only as far as the sphere of Venus (and thus
marks the planet only when it is on the lower half of its epicyclical
rotation).  Most early commentators, if they cite any astronomical
authority, refer to Ptolemy (for the relevance of his chapter on
eclipses, first mentioned by Jacopo della Lana).  Beginning in the late
nineteenth century, Alfraganus becomes more widely used as Dante
scholars began to understand the extent of the poet's debt to the Latin
translation of the ninth-century Arabian astronomer's work, in fact the
probable source for whatever Ptolemy he knew.  (See Toynbee,
"Alfergano" and "Tolommeo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~].)

In the Old Testament, Rahab has a major role in the second chapter of
Joshua (2:1-21), where she aids and abets two spies from Joshua's army;
then she is rescued during the destruction of the city by a grateful
Joshua (Joshua 6:22-25).  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 118-126) point out
that her salvation is not original with Dante, but is a matter of
biblical record, with such witness as offered by St. Paul (Hebrews
11:31) and St. James (James 2:25), the first of whom insists on her
faith in God, while the second extols her good works.  And see Matthew
1:5, where Rahab is listed as the mother of Boaz, and thus a distant
ancestress of Jesus.  For a figural understanding of Rahab, see
Auerbach ("Figurative Texts Illustrating Certain Passages of Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Speculum~ 21 [1946]: 482-84).

	|119-123.~  Dante slips back into the language of ^Paradiso~ III, where
Piccarda and Constance seem to be located in the Moon on a permanent
basis.  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. on verse 120), who are of the opinion
that Dante does not in fact mean what he seems to, since the souls of
all those who were harrowed from Hell by Christ (see ^Inf~. IV.52-63)
were assumed at once into the Rose, as have been, indeed, all those who
have been "graduated" from Purgatory (not to mention those few [we
assume] in the Christian era who went straight to Heaven).  However, we
may once again be witnessing the trace of an earlier plan (see the note
to ^Paradiso~ III.29-30).  Bosco/Reggio's alternative explanation seems
weak (repeating the explanation of Grabher [comm. to vv. 118-120]):
Dante only means that in the Empyrean their rank corresponded to the
rank of Venus among the planets.  Dante, in fact (and deliberately?),
never clarifies the relationship between the order of the eight heavens
in which he sees the saved arranged for his edification (nor indeed
between the hierarchy among the souls who appear in each heavenly
sphere) and the seating plan in the Rose.  One probable cause of his
avoidance of this question is that there are obvious distinctions among
the degrees of blessedness of the saved who appear in various spheres,
as we have just seen (Rahab is the highest in rank among these visitors
to Venus).  To calibrate ^both~ scales of beatitude probably proved too
much even for a Dante, who thus simply avoided a question that we
sometimes choose to force on him.

	|123.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 118-126) perhaps exhausted the possible
interpretations of this line.  The two "palms" refer to (1) the palms
of Rahab's hands when she lowered her line for Joshua's two spies from
the window of her room so that they could climb down; (2) the palms that
Joshua and those who followed him raised in prayer.  Benvenuto says
these interpretations have been suggested by other readers and
dismisses both of them in favor of (3): the palms of the hands of
Jesus, nailed to the cross.  While there is still a certain amount of
uncertainty, most current commentators support Benvenuto's reading.
The second interpretation has found occasional support: first, among
the moderns, in Andreoli (comm. to vv. 122-123); then in Bianchi (comm.
to this verse), who, however, ends up leaving the question open;
Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 121-123) does a full review of the exegetical
history and decides for Andreoli's version of Benvenuto's second
hypothesis.  Casini/Barbi (comm. to this verse) share this view.  But
Vandelli takes it upon himself to jettison Scartazzini's developed
argument without apology (he never mentions it).  Trucchi (comm. to vv.
121-126) is adamant for the hands-joined-in-prayer hypothesis; and
Giacalone (comm. to vv. 121-123) favors it over the palms of Christ.
The tercet (vv. 121-123) has continued to cause difficulty, perhaps
because of the uncertainty resulting from what Dante says about Rahab
being left as a trophy in Venus, which makes it sound much as though
Dante means that Christ, taking that first group of saved Hebrews to
Heaven, left her off in the third heaven.  Had he had the opportunity
to clarify what he meant, it seems likely that he would have done so.

	|124-126.~  In his ^voce~ dedicated to "Folchetto (Folco) di
Marsiglia," ^ED~ II (1970), p. 955b, Antonio Viscardi makes the
interesting suggestion that parallels exist between Folco's destruction
of the fortified town of Lavaur in the Albigensian Crusade in 1211,
accompanied by the voices of priests raised in song, and the fall of
Jericho, accomplished by the sound of trumpets and shouts; he also
suggests that both Folco and Rahab are humans stained by the sin of
lust and ultimately redeemed by good works.  For an earlier
appreciation of the parallel fates of Jericho and Lavaur, see Carroll
(comm. to vv. 109-126).

	|127-129.~  Satan is traditionally thought of as prideful (in that he
cannot accept being less important than God); but he is also thought of
as envious, particularly in his dealings with Adam and Eve, whose
happiness he cannot abide.  Dante uses the rhetorical figure
periphrasis here to rousing effect, for who does not know the "answer"
to this riddle?  We seem to be invited to shout the name of Lucifer.
But note also the crushing result when we consider the adverb ^pria~
(first): Satan may have been the first to deny his Creator, but he was
hardly the last, dear reader....

The sins of Eve and Adam brought all of us "distress" in that we weep
for our lost immortality.

For Satan's fall as a "foundation myth" of humankind, see the note to
^Inferno~ XXXIV.121-126.  This text would seem to offer another version
of that myth, with Satan's envy as the founding sin of Florence.

	|130-132.~  The gold florin, currency of Florence, has a lily stamped
on its face, and, "accurs@ed flower" that it is, has corrupted the
citizens of the town, whether old ("sheep") or young ("lambs"), because
it had first corrupted the clergy, turned from caretaker ("shepherd")
to greedy marauder of the flock ("wolf").  The avarice of the clergy
caused major complaint in the Middle Ages, even more so than the
runners-up, sexual license and gluttony.

	|133-135.~  The blackened margins of collections of decretals, or books
of ecclesiastical law, tell what interests lure the clergy to study:
the material advantage furthered, or so they believe, by mastering the
ins and outs of canon law.  For this they have given over, not only
consulting the Gospels, but studying the Fathers of the Church.  And in
one of his own letters (to the Italian cardinals gathered in France to
choose a new pope after the death of Clement V), Dante makes the same
charge, mentioning some specific names of those whom these cardinals do
not read: "Gregory lies among the cobwebs; Ambrose lies forgotten in
the cupboards of the clergy, and Augustine along with him; and
Dionysius, Damascenus, and Bede" (^Epist~. XI.16 [tr. P. Toynbee]).

For an attempt to date Dante's first expression of his hatred of
decretalists, see Maurizio Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni dantesche:
"Fiore", "Monarchia", "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003], p. 54).  And
see Anthony Cassell (^The "Monarchia" Controversy: An Historical Study
with Accompanying Translations of Dante Alighieri's "Monarchia," Guido
Vernani's "Refutation of the 'Monarchia' Composed by Dante," and Pope
John XXII's Bull "Si fratrum"~ [Washington, D.C.: Catholic University
of America 2004], pp. 12-13), adducing the fact that all the popes of
Dante's time (except, of course, Celestine V) were canon lawyers, a
fact that may help explain some of Dante's hostility to decretals.

In the early centuries of the Catholic Church, canon law was formed by
the member churches themselves at synods of bishops or church councils.
By the sixth century papal letters settling points in canon law (a
practice dating perhaps to the third or fourth century) began to be
included in collections of the decisions of synods and of councils.
Sometime between the late eighth and late ninth century there was
produced a collection, the so-called ^False Decretals~.  These spurious
documents included "papal letters" that had in common the desire to
strengthen papal authority.  Gratian, a sort of Justinian of canon law,
published his ^Decretum~ ca. 1150.  It codified the laws of the Church
(although it included many documents collected in the ^False
Decretals~) and enjoyed a great deal of authority.  To the surprise of
some, given Dante's dislike of those churchmen who are interested in
studying decretals as a path to maintaining or augmenting their
financial privilege, we find Gratian in the heaven of the Sun (^Par~.
X.103-105).  See J. Michael Gaynor, "Canon Law and Decretals".

	|136.~  "To it" refers, again, to the florin, to which the highest
ranks of the officialdom of the Church, the pope and his cardinals, pay
much more serious attention than their vows of poverty should allow.

	|137-142.~  The two references are, first, to the Annunciation (when
Gabriel "opened his wings" to Mary in Nazareth), second, to all those
martyred in Rome for their belief in Christ, starting with Peter
(buried on the Vatican hill) and filling many a catacomb.  Thus the two
exemplary groups bracket the birth and resurrection of Jesus, the one
preparing the way for Him, the second following his path into a
glorious death (and eventual resurrection).

Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 127-142) suggests that Dante's muffled
prophecy is set in the context of crusading (see vv. 125-126), without
going on to suggest that it calls for a new crusade.  However, that
does seem a real possibility.  At any rate, most commentators have
given up on finding a precise formulation for understanding Folco's
prophecy.  The "usual suspects" have been, more or less in this order
of popularity, the death of Boniface VIII, the removal of the papacy to
Avignon, the coming of a great leader (e.g., on the model of the
^veltro~ and/or the DXV).  It would not seem like Dante to have a
negative prophecy at this point (furthermore, the death of Boniface did
^not~ lead to a rejuvenation of the Church, nor did the "Avignonian
captivity"); nor would it seem like him to repeat a prophecy that he
would then repeat still again in ^Paradiso~ XXVII.145 (the ^fortuna~
[storm at sea]) and which is primarily imperial, not ecclesiastical, as
this one is.  And so it seems reasonable to suggest that Scartazzini
may have been on the right track.  Fallani (comm. to vv. 139-142) comes
close to saying so (without referring to Scartazzini).  And see Angelo
Penna, "Raab," ^ED~ IV (1973), p. 817a, who says in passing that vv.
112-142 reflect crusading.  Mark Balfour ("^Paradiso~ IX," in ^Dante's
"Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor
Wlassics [Lectura Dantis {virginiana}, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 140-41) sees the
desire for renewed crusading in the Holy Land as permeating the
conclusion of the canto, but follows exegetical tradition in seeing its
very last lines as referring to the ^veltro~ or DXV.  The Church (and
the entire context of this passage, vv. 133-142, which we hear in the
voice of a [crusading] churchman, ^is~ ecclesiastical) will reorder
itself only when it returns to its original purpose; for Dante, no
matter how this may trouble modern readers (including Brenda Deen
Schildgen ["Dante and the Crusades," ^Dante Studies~ 116 {1998}:
95-125]) that meant recapturing Jerusalem.
