	|1-12.~  In sharp contrast to both the opening six and concluding nine
verses of the preceding canto, with their visionary taste of a
Trinitarian and ordered love and then the sound made by the singing
souls in the Sun (compared to the harmonious chiming of matins calling
monks to prayer), the opening nine verses of this canto summon images
of ceaseless and futile human activity, from which Dante is happy to
have been, at least temporarily, liberated.  Defending both the
importance and power of this introductory passage, disliked by some for
delaying Francis's appearance in Thomas's narrative, see Mario
Aversano, "S. Francesco nel canto XI del ^Paradiso~" (in ^Il velo di
Venere: Allegoria e teologia dell'immaginario dantesco~ [Naples:
Federico & Ardia, 1984], pp. 169-77).

	|1.~  Dante's reflection of the opening verse of Persius's ^Satires~
("^O curas hominum~, o quantum est in rebus inane" [O wearisome cares
of men, o emptiness of the things we care for]) had an early
twentieth-century notice in Alfonso Bertoldi (^Il canto XI del
"Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni, 1903],
p. 7).  However, it was first observed in the late fourteenth century
by the author of the ^Chiose ambrosiane~, and not, as Ettore Paratore
("Persio," ^ED~ IV [1973]) claimed, by Vellutello a century and a half
later.  Dante does name Persius once (see ^Purg~. XXII.100).  Exempting
those texts with which he obviously has wide acquaintance (e.g., the
Bible, Aristotle, Virgil, Ovid), we should probably be aware that in
medieval ^compendia~ and in references to other works in treatises,
^incipit~s were a customary way in which to refer to a previous
author's work.  Thus, when we come a reference in Dante's pages that
consists only of the first line of a text, we should be careful before
assigning him even a minimal acquaintance with that particular text.
For instance, Mario Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the
^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001), p. 48, suggests that Dante's text here reflects the citation of
the first verse of Persius's first ^Satire~ in Alain de Lille's ^Summa
de arte praedicatoria~.  But see Paratore, "Persio," for a strong
argument that Dante knew the actual texts of Persius.

The word ^cura~ has an interesting history in the poem.  It occurs only
four times in ^Inferno~, and then is never used of the emotions of a
damned soul, and is only used of either Virgil or Dante once (at
^Inf~. XXXIV.135), when they are on their way up to Purgatory.  In
fact, most of its uses are found in ^Purgatorio~ (ca. 21, something
over half its total appearances), with only about a dozen or fewer in
^Paradiso~.  Somehow, it seems quintessentially a word associated with
human life on earth, or in the most related form of afterlife, that
experienced in purgatory.  In both these arenas care is inevitable,
anxiety in the living for whatever threatens human well being or
pleasure, concern in the purging dead lest they not accomplish their
task as quickly and as well as possible.

	|2.~  Depending on whether we have read Paradiso X.138 ^in bono~ or ^in
malo~, that is, whether we have thought Dante meant to praise or blame
Siger's "syllogizing," we decide that the noun form of that word is
here used oppositionally or with the same intonation.  See the note to
^Paradiso~ X.138 for reasons to prefer the first alternative; where
Siger is admirable for his powers of reasoning, the normal run of men
is not, merely using reason to advance their cupidinous designs.

Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 48, suggests
that ^difettivi~ (flawed) is one of the key words of this canto,
calling into question all prideful intellectual acts of humankind,
which contrast with the humility embodied in Francis.

	|3.~  The metaphor of lowered wings suggests that we mortals, born
worms but with the ability to be transformed into angelic butterflies
(according to ^Purg~. X.124-125), nevertheless choose to direct our
cares to the things of this world, lowering the level of our desires.

	|4-9.~  Dante's list of vain human activities starts out with law
(whether civil or canonical); medicine (identified by one of the
earliest known doctors, Hippocrates, author of the medical text that
bears the title, ^Aphorisms~); priesthood (as a position rather than as
a calling); political power (whether achieved by force or guile).  This
list matches up fairly well with the one found earlier (at ^Par~.
VIII.124-126: Solon, Xerxes, Melchizedek, Daedalus) in at least three
out of four categories, if there is no easy match between Hippocrates
(the doctor) and Daedalus (the artisan).  This opening catalogue of
four professions is conjoined to a second one, also of four activities,
now divided into two parts, the lower instincts (robbery [with avarice
at its root] and sexual pleasure [the sin of lust]) and the more
civilized (but equally distracting) behaviors, immersion in civic duty
or in one's idle self.  (Michel de Montaigne would have sharply
disagreed with Dante's harsh view of ^otium~.)

	|5.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) point out that Dante's word
^sacerdozio~ for "priesthood" has the sense of an ecclesiastical office
that yields a good living to its holder, and refer to Dante's previous
attack on those religious (almost all of them, Dante has previously
said) who study only in order to gain wealth or honors (see ^Conv~.
III.xi.10).

	|10-12.~  Punning on the first noun in ^Paradiso~, the glory ^(la
gloria)~ of God, Dante separates himself from the eight activities he
has just catalogued by noting his freedom from such preoccupations as
are caused by them and enjoying his presence here in the Sun, welcomed
by these souls who live, still higher above, ^in gloria~ with God.

	|13-18.~  The spirits moving in this first solar circle, having
surrounded Beatrice and Dante, become fixed, like candles on their
holders, and one of them (Thomas) speaks.

	|19-21.~  Dante here gives Thomas one of the relatively few similes
allowed to a speaker in the poem.  One feels compelled to wonder what,
had he been able to read these cantos of ^Paradiso~, he would have
thought of his inclusion in them.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ X.86-96.

	|22-27.~  Perhaps we are meant to be amused that Thomas's eulogy of
Francis begins as a gloss on two difficult passages in his own "poem"
(see ^Par~. X.96 and X.114), the veiled speech that made the historical
Thomas distrust poetry.

	|28-36.~  This convoluted and difficult passage may be paraphrased as
follows: "God's foresight, with such deep wisdom that none may fathom
it, selected two guides for the Church so that she, married to Him at
the moment when Christ cried out in pain on the Cross [Daniello, comm.
to vv. 28-34: see Luke 23:46] and shed His blood to wed her [Lombardi,
comm. to vv. 31-34: see Acts 20:28], might proceed joyously, and with
greater confidence and faith, following Him."  Thus Francis and
Dominic, the first of whom was indeed often portrayed as a "second
Christ" (see, among others, Auerbach ["St. Francis of Assisi in Dante's
^Commedia~," in ^Scenes from the Drama of European Literature~, tr. C.
Garvin {New York: Meridian Books, 1959 [1944]}, p. 85]), each takes on
the role of Christ in husbanding the Church through her many
tribulations both in his lifetime and thereafter, by instrument of the
mendicant order that he, having founded, left behind him.

	|34-39.~  See Umberto Cosmo (^L'ultima ascesa: Introduzione alla
lettura del "Paradiso"~, ed. B. Maier [Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1965
{1936}], pp. 123-25) for the view that Dante nourished his hopes for
the Church's renewal with the writings of Ubertino da Casale,
particularly his ^Arbor vitae crucifixae Iesu~.

	|37-42.~  The complementarity of the founders of the two orders is
insisted on here, not their distinguishing features.  Thus before we
hear a word about either Francis or Dominic, respectively associated
with the Seraphim (the highest angelic order) and love and with the
Cherubim (the next order down) and knowledge, we are informed in no
uncertain terms that we should not rank one higher than the other.  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XII.46-57.  And see Carroll (comm. to vv. 37-39)
for a similar attempt to bridge what he refers to as "mysticism" and
"scholasticism."

It may have been Bernardino Daniello (comm. to vv. 40-42) who first
brought historical fact into play in interpreting this part of the
canto.  It was a matter of record, he reports, that on Francis's feast
day (4 October) one of the friars of his order would preach the virtues
of Dominic, while on the feast of Dominic (8 August), a Dominican would
do the same for Francis.  Daniello suggests that this practice lies
behind Dante's here.  As many have ruefully noted, that spirit of
fraternity between these two groups of friars did not present an
accurate picture of the relations, in fact emulous, between these two
mendicant Orders in Dante's time.

	|37-39.~  For a likely source in the ^Arbor vitae crucifixae Iesu~ of
Ubertino da Casale for Dante's making Francis seraphic and Dominic
cherubic, see Nicol@o Mineo ("La 'vita' di San Francesco nella 'festa
di paradiso,'" in ^I primi undici canti del "Paradiso" [Lectura Dantis
Metelliana]~, ed. Attilio Mellone [Rome: Bulzoni, 1992], p. 273).

	|43-117.~  Here begins Dante's ^Vita Francisci~.  On Dante's sense of
the life of Francis as a model for his representation of his once
prideful and now exiled self, see Ronald Herzman ("From Francis to
Solomon: Eschatology in the Sun," in ^Dante for the New Millennium~,
ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New York: Fordham
University Press, 2003], p. 323).  For a brief essay on the canto as a
whole, see Bruno Nardi ("Il canto di S. Francesco," in his ^"Lecturae"
e altri studi danteschi~, ed. Rudy Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1990
{1964}], pp. 173-84); for a much longer treatment, see Nicol@o Mineo
("La 'vita' di San Francesco nella 'festa di paradiso,'" in ^I primi
undici canti del "Paradiso" [Lectura Dantis Metelliana]~, ed. Attilio
Mellone [Rome: Bulzoni, 1992], pp. 223-320).  For bibliography, see
Stanislao da Campagnola, "Francesco di Assisi, santo," ^ED~ III (1971).
 For the various lives of Francis known to Dante, see Stanislao da
Campagnola's article ("Francesco d'Assisi in Dante," ^Laurentianum~ 24
[1983]: 175-92).  And for the relationship between the historical
Francis and Dante's portrait of him, see Attilio Mellone ("Il san
Francesco di Dante e il san Francesco della storia," in ^Dante e il
francescanesimo~ [Cava de' Terreni: Avagliano, 1987], pp. 11-73) and
Mario Aversano (^Dante e gli "scritti" di San Francesco~ [Salerno:
Palladio, 1984]), arguing that sources for much of the language
dedicated to portraying St. Francis are found in Francis's own
writings; but his proofs are far from conclusive, given that the texts
he cites from Francis, as will often necessarily be the case, are
frequently themselves citations of the Bible.  For some more recent
bibliography, see Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy":
Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992], p.
334, n. 6).  And now see Nick Havely (^Dante and the Franciscans:
Poverty and the Papacy in the "Commedia"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 2004]) for the overall influence on the ^Comedy~ of
Franciscan writings concerning poverty.

	|43-51.~  These three tercets of Thomas might be paraphrased as
follows: "Between the Topino and the Chiascio, which flows down from
Gubbio, perched on a fertile slope on Mount Subasio, whence Perugia,
some twelve miles to the west, feels both cold air from the mountains
and the heat of the easterly sun, sits Assisi, while farther to the
east the towns Nocera and Gualdo suffer both from the cold and from
being misgoverned by the Guelph Perugians.  From here, where the
mountain is least steep, arose a sun, just as the Sun we are in rises
from Ganges in summer (when it is brightest)."

But see Guglielmo Gorni ("Due note su ^Paradiso~ XI," ^L'Alighieri~ 23
[2004]: 47-51) for an argument, countering that offered first by
Alfonso Bertoldi (^Il canto XI del "Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis
Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni, 1903]), who holds for a political
reading of these verses) and that goes a step farther than E.G. Parodi
(^Lingua e letteratura~, ed. G. Folena [Venice: Neri Pozza, 1957], p.
387), who simply opposes a political reading), that this geography
needs to be understood in religious (and not political) terms, i.e.,
that God smiles upon the place of Francis's birth.

	|44.~  The "bless@ed Ubaldo," canonized in 1192, was born Ubaldo
Baldassini in 1084 and served as Bishop of Gubbio (1129-1160).  Before
he allowed himself an ecclesiastical life, he lived as a hermit on a
hill near that town, along the stream named Chiascio.

	|47.~  Before it was destroyed, Porta Sole was one of the city gates of
Perugia.  Located on the southeast side of the city, it faced Assisi.

	|48.~  Nocera is a town in Umbria, some fifteen miles northeast of
Assisi; Gualdo Tadino is also in Umbria and like it on the eastern
slope of Mount Subasio.  The two towns "mourn beneath their heavy yoke"
perhaps in two senses: literally, they are beneath the peaks of the
Apennine range (and thus overshadowed by them); metaphorically, they
suffer under Guelph rule.

	|51.~  The Ganges, about which we will hear again in ^Paradiso~ XIX.71,
was for Dante the defining eastern limit of his world.  (Seville
[^Inf~. XX.126 and XXVI.110] was close to the western limit, as Ulysses
discovered).  For earlier reference to the Ganges, see ^Purgatorio~
II.5 and XXVII.4.

	|53-54.~  ^Ascesi~: For the phrase describing Francis as "quasi Sol
oriens in mundo" (like the Sun rising on the world) by one of his
chroniclers, Bernardo da Bessa, see Ignazio Baldelli ("Il canto XI del
^Paradiso~," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VI [Florence: Le Monnier,
1973], p. 105); this source was perhaps first cited by Daniello (comm.
to verse 50).  Perhaps the only commentator to be properly puzzled by
what this verse means, whether in Dante's formulation itself or in more
than six hundred years of commentary that have yet to produce a
convincing resolution, is Chimenz (comm. to vv. 52-54).  For a
discussion of the complementary if differing interpretations of Bosco
and Auerbach, see Giacalone (comm. to verse 54).  But no one apparently
has thought of the most simple reason that might have made Dante prefer
"Or,iente" to "Ascesi": the tenses of the Latin verb and participle.
"Ascesi" ("I have risen," certainly a Christ-like enough word) yields
to "Or,iente" (rising) because the second word is present tense, i.e.,
is not confined to the past.  Francis, like Christ, is ^always~ rising,
leading us Heavenward.

The first commentator to turn to Bonaventure's life of Francis for a
source, a practice of many contemporary glossators, was apparently
Lombardi (comm. to vv. 53-54): "Vidi Alterum Angelum ascendentem ab
ortu Solis, habentem signum Dei vivi" (I saw another angel ascending
from the east, having the seal of the living God [Apoc. 7:2]).  We may
note that St. Bonaventure's biblical formula also makes use of a
present participle - two of them, in fact.  Umberto Bosco (^Dante
vicino~ [Caltanissetta: Sciascia, 1966], p. 322) privileges the
Apocalypse over Franciscan writings as compelling Dante's attention,
but not convincingly, since Dante may have been reminded of the
Apocalypse precisely by Bonaventure.

	|55.~  Dante puns on the Sun again, using a metaphoric valence for his
birth (^orto~ [rising]) more readily associated with the rising of a
star or planet in the sky.

	|56-57.~  Again Francis, beginning his career of service to God and
humankind, is seen as the Sun, now preparing the earth to be fruitful.

	|58-60.~  Francis's father raised his son to pursue the life of
commerce, as he himself had done.  Dante has boiled down into a single
tercet the dramatic story of Francis's public rejection of his father's
plans for him, taking the clothes off his back to return them to him in
a public square of Assisi.  This choice is represented here by his
"marrying" Lady Poverty.  (One of the popular Franciscan narratives of
the thirteenth century was the ^Sacrum commercium beati Francisci cum
domina Paupertate~.  For an attempt to establish Dante's acquaintance
with this work as already revealed in passages in ^Purgatorio~, see
Havely ["Poverty in Purgatory: From ^Commercium~ to ^Commedia~," ^Dante
Studies~ 114 {1996}: 229-43].  That conceit gives the controlling image
to the next fifty verses (58-117).  And, while even indirect reference
to the conflict between the Spiritual and Conventual Franciscans will
not confront the reader until the next canto (XII.124), it is clear
from the outset that Dante essentially sides with the Spirituals, whose
central and urgent position was the radical insistence on the Church
owning nothing, a view that happens to coincide with Dante's political
views.  This is not to say that his religious feelings about poverty
were ungenuine, but merely to point out that a secondary reason for
them does exist.  Raoul Manselli, "francescanesimo," ^ED~ III (1971),
pp. 14a-16b, points out that the fourteenth-century struggle within the
Order had its roots in the papacy of Celestino V, in the waning years
of the thirteenth century, when a group of Franciscans received
permission to split off and form their own "sub-order."  They were
fairly soon forced to flee Italy (most of them for Greece).  This group
included John of Peter Olivi and Ubertino of Casale, both of whom
eventually resurfaced in Florence.  For a recent discussion in English
of Dante's views of the Spiritual Franciscans, see Havely (^Dante and
the Franciscans: Poverty and the Papacy in the "Commedia"~ [Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press], 2004).

As Erich Auerbach ("St. Francis of Assisi in Dante's ^Commedia~," in
^Scenes from the Drama of European Literature~, tr. C. Garvin [New
York: Meridian Books, 1959 {1944}], p. 84) points out, the painted
representation of the life of Francis in the lower church at Assisi
contains no reference to this "marriage," which is the subject of
another (allegorical) painting, set apart from the cycle of Francis's
deeds, while Dante treats it as the central act in the Saint's life.

For Dante's possible reaction to the account of the visit to Francis of
the three poverty-stricken women ^(mulieres pauperculae),~ see Edmund
Gardner (^Dante and the Mystics~ [London: Dent, 1913], pp. 240-42).  He
points out that elements in the exilic ^canzone~, "Tre donne attorno al
cor mi son venute" (^Rime~ CIV), represent perhaps the first extensive
borrowing from a Franciscan text in Dante's work, arguing that the
appearance of Poverty and her two companions to Francis on his way to
Siena furnish the basic ingredients of this moving poem.

	|60.~  In the past sixty years there has been dispute over the somewhat
curious phrase "la porta del piacere" (lit., "the door of pleasure"),
generally understood to understate the aversion to poverty, i.e., none
opens the door to her gladly, none welcomes poverty into his heart.
This became "the doorway to pleasure" (^die Pforte der Lust~ [^Neue
Dantestudien~, Istanbul, 1944, p. 80]) in Auerbach's ("St. Francis of
Assisi in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Scenes from the Drama of European
Literature~, tr. C. Garvin [New York: Meridian Books, 1959 {1944}], pp.
88-89) formulation (his translator does not help his case, making
^porta~ plural, while it is singular, and mistranslating ^piacere~ in
her "gates of desire," if one must admit that translating the phrase
presents something of a problem).  If most were scandalized by this
reading, it has found support in some quarters, e.g., Marguerite Mills
Chiarenza ("Dante's Lady Poverty," ^Dante Studies~ 111 [1993]: 153-75).
 The core of Auerbach's interpretation, possibly the most controversial
point in a series of works dealing with Dante that were hardly intended
to be without cause for controversy, may be represented in a single
sentence: "It seems to me absolutely necessary to interpret the opening
of the gates of desire in the proper sense as a sexual act, and thus
^porta~ as the gateway to the feminine body" (p. 88).  For some of the
many counter-arguments, see Ettore Bonora ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura
Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo,
2000 {1987}], pp. 242-43); Emilio Pasquini ("Il ^Paradiso~ e una nuova
idea di figuralismo," ^Intersezioni~ 16 [1996]: 422-23); see also
Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~
[Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], pp. 193-94).  Supporters of Auerbach's
reading fail to take into account that it is the male in the metaphor
who opens ^his~ "porta del piacere" to the lady, thus rendering the
entire genital argument inapplicable.

	|61-63.~  In 1207, before the court of the bishop of his hometown and
^coram patre~ (Latin: "in the presence of his father"), he renounced
his family and the life that had been chosen for him in order to follow
Christ.  In no other figure in the history of the Church does the
concept of the "imitation of Christ" have so obvious and central a
relation as it has in the life of Francis of Assisi.

His "spouse," Poverty, once chosen, becomes increasingly more precious
to him; as we will shortly find out (vv. 64-66), she had been married
once before, and her previous husband had been no one less than Jesus.

	|64-66.~  While at first the reader is perhaps not sure as to the
identity of Poverty's first husband, it will soon (at verse 72) become
clear that she was Jesus' "wife," left a widow by the Crucifixion in
A.D. 34, and remaining "unmarried" for 1173 years, unwanted by any
other suitor, until Francis' vow in 1207.

Dante has outdone himself.  The writings about Francis (who was
practically the cause of the explosion of the biography industry all by
himself [there were at least eight "lives" produced within the century
of his death]) have, except for the Gospels, no antecedents.  Dante's
addition to existing Franciscan material is spectacularly original in
its reworking of the basic narrative found in Bonaventure and others.
Dante expands the role of poverty not so much conceptually (the
devotion to poverty is the keystone of all Franciscan writings) but
stylistically, making his saintly life an allegorical tale of his
relationship to her.  He can, given the abundance of "official lives,"
count on his readers to fill in the by then familiar historical details.

For the influence of Franciscan lyric poetry (and especially that of
Iacopone da Todi) on Dante, see Alessandro Vettori (^Poets of Divine
Love: Franciscan Mystical Poetry of the Thirteenth Century~ [New York:
Fordham University Press, 2004], pp. 120-22).  And for its influence on
a critic, writing on this canto, see Nardi ("Il Canto XI," in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989 {1965}], pp. 313-29), who produced a footnoteless
Franciscan ^lectura~ of this canto, showing the charm of imitation.
Luciano Rossi ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~,
ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002],
pp. 170-72) follows up a suggestion of Lucia Battaglia Ricci ("Figure
di contraddizione: Lettura dell'XI canto del ^Paradiso~," in ^Studi in
onore di Emilio Bigi~ [Milan: Principato, 1997], p. 42) and argues that
Dante's eleventh canto reflects Francis's ^Laudes creaturarum~ (see the
note to ^Inf~. I.117).

It seems possible that the author of the ^Commedia~ has, improbable as
this may seem, gone beyond the prideful bearing that afflicted so much
of his earlier work and attained a kind of humility (see Hollander
["Dante's Pride," in ^Studi sul canone letterario del Trecento: Per
Michelangelo Picone~, a cura di J. Bartuschat and L. Rossi {Ravenna:
Longo, 2003}, pp. 43-55]).  For the crucial role of Francis in the
development of that humility, particularly as counter-force to the arid
intellectual pride that leads to heresy, see Marco Veglia ("Per
un'ardita umilt@a.  L'averroismo di Dante tra Guido Cavalcanti, Sigieri
di Brabante e San Francesco d'Assisi," ^Schede Umanistiche~ 1 [2000]:
75-97).

	|67-69.~  Not content with making Poverty the "wife" of Jesus and then
of Francis, Dante invents her presence in classical epic, adding her to
the participants in that scene in Lucan (^Phars~. V.515-531) in which
Caesar's bellowing, bullying manner cannot impress the poverty-stricken
fisherman, Amyclas (see Dante's earlier treatment, without mention of
Lady Poverty, in ^Convivio~ IV.xiii.12), not evincing fear because he
has nothing of which to be robbed.

Occasionally, a reader (e.g., Carlo Grabher, comm. to vv. 64-75)
complains that this bit of business seems overly cerebral (along with
the next ^exemplum~, the presence of Poverty on the cross with Jesus).
It surely reveals the high regard Dante held for Lucan's text
(^scriptura paganorum~ [the scripture of the pagans] -- see the note to
^Par~. I.16-18), not only putting a moment from its narrative alongside
one from the Bible (a familiar enough Dantean technique), but alongside
one of the supreme moments in the Bible, Jesus' death on the cross; yet
Grabher's point is well taken.

We probably should not attempt to analyze further the exact nature of
Poverty's relationship with Amyclas within the metaphor, i.e., were
they married, sexually involved, or "just friends"?  The point is
clearly that the fisherman's poverty freed him from fearing the
all-powerful and jealous Julius.  Nonetheless, we can make an exactly
similar point about both Jesus and Francis; and so we are left with a
nagging uncertainty about the way in which we should frame this
apparently first relationship between this lady and a lover.

	|70-72.~  If Lady Poverty's loyalty to Amyclas had won her no new
friends for more than a millennium, this result is all the more
surprising in that she was the last one to solace Jesus in His final
agony.

	|72.~  A much debated line, from the earliest days to the present.  Is
the verb in this line ^pianse~ (wept), as Petrocchi has decided, or is
it ^salse~ (climbed), as Benvenuto da Imola insisted (comm. to vv.
70-72)?  Evidently, the shocking and otherwise unheard-of act that is
portrayed if the reader accepts the second option has kept some
commentators on the side of the version of this verse contained in the
^Codice cassinese~, in which we find ^pianse~.  As always, we are
constrained (as we should be) by our decision to follow Petrocchi's
text; on this occasion we would have gladly been governed by
Benvenuto's reading of the line.

	|73.~  Thomas is concerned lest he had allowed his speech to become
^chiuso~ (dark, unclear) and we consequently not understand of whom and
of what he spoke, thus reflecting his characterization (vv. 22-24) of
his figurative speech in the previous canto (most specifically ^Par~.
X.96, his metaphor of fattening sheep, on which he has been expanding
here) as not being ^aperta~ (clear).  Once again one may witness,
behind the text, Dante's desire to deal with Thomas's attacks on the
unreliable nature of poetic speech (see Hollander ["Dante
^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante Studies~ 94 {1976}: 91-136]).

	|74.~  Finally we hear the name of this hero of the religious life.
Ernesto Trucchi (comm. to vv. 55-57) revives the account of a certain
preacher, named Chalippe, who, in town to address the faithful of Lucca
during the Lenten observances of 1689, was shown names engraved in
stone by a canon of Lucca named Moriconi.  These were two Luccan
brothers, one of whom, Bernardo Moriconi, left his native city and
settled in Assisi.  His son, Pietro (Bernardone, after his father)
Moriconi, married a noblewoman by the name of Pica Bourlement.  In 1181
they had a son, baptized (at the mother's instigation, since the father
was away at the time) as Giovanni.  Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro
Bernardone was furious, since he had wanted his son to bear the name of
Francesco (the adjective for "French" in Italian) to honor his own
pleasure in association with France, the country where he had made his
fortune as a merchant.  Accordingly, the day of the boy's confirmation,
Pietro had his name changed.  And that, apparently, is how Francesco
d'Assisi got his name.

	|76.~  See Bruno Porcelli ("Numeri e nomi nei canti danteschi del
sole," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 117 [2000]: 1-5)
for a discussion of the word ^concordia~ (harmony) as a key to
understanding the cantos of the Sun.

	|77-78.~  Indeed, the growing love between Francis and his lady,
Poverty, is a form of ^concordia~ developed out of apparent discord:
the first description of poverty as something, like death, that no one
willingly welcomes.

	|79-84.~  The first followers of Francis, those who were eventually
gathered into the Order of Friars Minor (so called by Francis in his
first Rule, indicating their humility, i.e,, they were "lesser
brothers"), are now presented: Bernard of Quintavalle (a fellow
townsman of Assisi, also from a wealthy family, who was so impressed by
Francis's actions that he sold all his possessions in benefit of the
poor and became his first follower; Francis considered Bernard his
"first born"); Egidio (or Giles) and Silvester, both also of Assisi
(the first was also among the earliest of Francis's followers and lived
until 1262; Silvester was already a priest, who, when he had a dream in
which Francis killed a dragon menacing the city, he joined the group;
he died ca. 1240).

The sensuous delights of going barefoot are portrayed as the freedom of
the soul in unstinting love of Christ.  We note that the heat increases
in these lines: Bernard is described with a past definite ^(si
scalz@o)~ as having taken his shoes off, but then the verb is repeated
in the present tense ^(scalzasi)~ for Giles and Silvester.  Those uses
of the "historical present" intensify the feeling of liberation as, one
by one, Francis's followers begin also to fall in love with this ugly
woman.

	|82.~  The adjective ^ferace~ (literally, fertile, fecund), a hapax in
the poem (as is, more surprisingly, the parallel adjective that
precedes it, ^ignota~ [unknown]), contrasts with the notion of ordinary
life, based as it is in acquiring wealth and possessions, not in living
one's faith.  Like its unique status among the words of the poem, its
unusualness in ordinarily sterile human experience sets it apart.

	|84.~  On this verse, see Ferruccio Ulivi ("San Francesco e Dante,"
^Letture classensi~ 11 [1982]: 22), attacking Erich Auerbach ("St.
Francis of Assisi in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Scenes from the Drama of
European Literature~, tr. C. Garvin [New York: Meridian Books, 1959
{1944}]) for not understanding how changed she is in Francis's eyes.
But see the line itself ("si la sposa piace"): one can almost hear the
suppressed assonantal "spiace" (displeases), the normal reaction of
almost everyone who is forced to contemplate the visage of Poverty.

	|85-86.~  These lines summarize the result of the family struggle
between Pietro Bernardone and his son, once known as Giovanni (Sigmund
Freud must have enjoyed this passage): Francis, having rejected his own
father, has himself become a father and a teacher; having rejected his
own family, he has created a group of apostolic brethren.

	|87.~  The word ^capestro~ refers to the rope used to control horses or
oxen, i.e., a halter, and was used as a belt by Francis and his first
followers as an outward sign both of their inner control and of their
humility before God.  See its other two occurrences as an identifying
mark of Franciscan friars, ^Inferno~ XXVII.92 and ^Paradiso~ XI.132.
And see the note to ^Inferno~ XVI.106-108 for the word ^corda~ (cord),
also used to designate the cincture of a garment worn by a member of a
religious order (of its fourteen appearances in the poem, however, only
two others refer to such a use [^Inf~. XXVII.67; ^Purg~. VII.114]).

	|88-93.~  In 1214 Francis went to Rome and had an audience with Pope
Innocent III, who approved the founding of the Order (he gave it its
"first seal").  See Tozer's paraphrase (comm. to these verses): "On
that occasion he was not shamefaced on account of the meanness of his
origin or his contemptible appearance, but 'like a prince declared to
Innocent his stern intention' of founding his Order: It is a little
difficult to reconcile the statement about the meanness of his origin
with the fact that his father was a well-to-do merchant; but this
appears to be the meaning, for St. Bonaventura in his Life of St.
Francis says that, when the epithets 'boorish' and 'mercenary' were
applied to him, the Saint was wont to reply, that such reproaches were
suitably addressed to Pietro Bernardone's son ('Talia enim licet audire
filium Petri de Bernardone' [^Legenda maior~ VI.2])."

	|91.~  Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della
"Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], p. 241) points out that
words in Dante's narrative at times are at radical odds with their
counterparts in the various ^vitae~ of St. Francis, as here
^regalmente~ (regally) replaces the adverb ^humiliter~ (humbly);
similarly, in verse 101, the Sultan's presence is described as being
^superba~ (prideful) while in the lives of Francis he is presented as
offering a respectful welcome; or, in verse 106, Mount Alvernia is
portrayed as a ^crudo sasso~ (rugged rock) rather than as the ^locus
amoenus~ (pleasant place) of his biographers' accounts.  What these
changes commonly reflect is Dante's desire to make Francis's story more
heroic than did his own biographers, who dwelled on his humility.  As
opposed to those who would only contrast Francis and Dominic, Dante
matches them as "militant heroes" of the Church.  See the note to
^Paradiso~ XII.35.

	|92.~  Dante suppresses reference (because he knows his reader will
supply it?) to the narrative that appears not only in all the early
lives of Francis, but which has a role in Giotto's representation of
his life in the Upper Church at Assisi.  Pope Innocent III at first was
not favorable to Francis's petition and was planning to deny it.  He
had a dream, however, in which he saw Francis holding the tottering
Church of St. John Lateran on his shoulders, and that won him over.

	|94-99.~  In fewer than ten years the order had grown from a relatively
tiny band (those who had joined by the time Francis first went to Rome)
into some five thousand members in 1223, by the time he goes there to
appear before Pope Onorius III and receive the "second seal" of his
mission from him.

	|94.~  The ^gente poverella~ (his followers, sworn to poverty) are to
be distinguished from "ordinary" ^povera gente~ (poor people): Francis
and his followers ^chose~ poverty, not necessarily having been born to
it.

	|96.~  There are three basic constructions of the possible meaning of
this contested line: Francis's life (1) is to be praised only for the
greater glory of God, (2) were better sung in Heaven than by his
(corrupt?) followers down there on earth, (3) were better sung in the
Empyrean than (by me [Thomas]?) here in the Sun.  Jacopo della Lana
briefly and elliptically (comm. to vv. 96-99: "if only they kept to
their leader's example") suggested an early form of (2), while a
version of (1) was proposed by Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 94-99)
and another of (3) by Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 94-105).  A
softer version of (2) was proposed by John of Serravalle (comm. to vv.
94-99), who contrasts the worthy praise of Francis's followers on earth
with the more exalted laudatory outpouring offered by the blessed in
Heaven.  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 96), in his familiar acerbic tone,
dismisses all previous comments and then attempts what he considers
(but see Benvenuto's gloss, referred to above, which includes the
phrase "ad gloriam gratiae divinae") a new interpretation when he
understands the import of "^in~ gloria del ciel" to be "to the glory of
God," considering Dante to have meant "^alla~ gloria del ciel."  His is
the first modern statement of (1), and has a good many followers,
including Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse), even if Scartazzini is
not ever mentioned.  One of the strongest supporting arguments for (2)
is found in Tozer (comm. to verse 96): "That this is the meaning is
rendered probable by the following passage in an early life of St.
Francis by Prudenzano, which Dante may well have seen: -- 'Dai Serafini
(tanta era stata la virt@u del Santo) le Salmodie in onore di lui
^meglio e pi@u degnamente sarebbersi cantate nella gloria del cielo~
[Tozer's italics], anzich@e da' suoi frati degeneri in coro'" (citing
Moore [^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical
Authors in Dante~ {Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]}, p. 86]).  But see
the perhaps even stronger objection to (2) lodged by Porena (comm. to
verse 96): in these paired cantos a Dominican (Thomas) and a Franciscan
(Bonaventure) inveigh against corruption in their own orders, and
praise the founders of the other; thus for Thomas to declaim against
Franciscans would be outside Dante's carefully laid out program.
Sapegno argues (comm. to this verse) briefly and cogently against the
first two hypotheses and makes a convincing case for the third, giving
it its first complete statement: "The life of Francis is more worthy of
being sung in the Empyrean by choruses of angels and of souls in bliss
than it is of being described in pedestrian ways by me alone."  Thus,
in this canto based on praise for Francis's humility, Thomas displays
his own as well.  However, the fact remains that none of the eight
commentaries written after Sapegno's and present in the DDP makes
reference to his hypothesis, except for Bosco/Reggio's, which is at the
very least dubious about its worth, preferring, as we have seen,
hypothesis (1).

	|99.~  The word ^archimandrita~, a word formed out of a Greek
ecclesiastical term meaning "chief shepherd" (from ^arch~ \+ ^mandra~
["sheepfold"]), and thus the head of more than one monastic community,
a hapax in the poem (but which appears, denoting the apostle Peter, in
^Mon~. III.ix.17; it also is present, referring to the pope, in
^Epist~. XI.13).  This word is not, as some might expect, a Dantean
coinage, but may have been found by him in the ^Magnae derivationes~ of
Uguccione da Pisa, as Grandgent (comm. to vv. 97-99) seems to have been
the first commentator to suggest.

	|100-105.~  Drawn by his hope for martyrdom, in imitation of Christ,
Francis, accompanied by twelve of his followers (a number obviously
meant to recall Jesus' twelve disciples), went to Egypt during a
crusade.  He insisted, at great risk to all of their lives, on trying
to convert the Sultan, Malik al-Kamil, and preached before him to no
avail.  The Mohammedan, showing great restraint (and perhaps some
political astuteness), sent Francis and his fellows back to the
Christian army.  Francis, seeing his plans for martyrdom during crusade
foiled by his gracious adversary, returned to Italy.

Dante presents this episode out of sequence, since the Egyptian journey
occurred in 1219, four years before his second trip to Rome, presented
in vv. 94-99.

	|106-108.~  A year after his receiving the second seal from the pope,
Francis receives his third and final seal on Mount Alvernia directly
from Christ, the five stigmata that marked his body as they had marked
His.

	|109-117.~  Francis's death receives more poetic space than any other
element in Thomas's biography.  His soul flies back to its Maker (this
is one of the few specific notices we have that some of the saved
bypass purgation in order to proceed directly to Heaven; see the note
to ^Paradiso~ X.121-129).

The merchant in him, now totally redefined, does what all merchants are
sure to do: make a will in favor of their surviving family or friends.
Thus does Francis leave his "treasure" to his "family," commending them
to love his "wife," Poverty, and commending his body to the dust,
whence we all came.  In good Franciscan fashion, he does not even want
a plain coffin, only the earth itself.

Thomas's narrative has moved first along a vertical axis, beginning in
the mountains above Assisi (vv. 43-45), and descending from there; then
along a horizontal axis, as Francis moves around Italy and the Near
East; and finally ending, once more on a mountain (Alvernia, verse
106), with his soul moving up still higher, to Heaven, while his body's
latent movement is down, back into nothingness, without a containing
bier (^bara~, the last word in Thomas's narrative), in the earth.  He
was canonized within two years of his death (1228).

	|111.~  Marco Veglia ("Per un'ardita umilt@a.  L'averroismo di Dante
tra Guido Cavalcanti, Sigieri di Brabante e San Francesco d'Assisi,"
^Schede Umanistiche~ 1 [2000]: 94-95) points out that there is a
Franciscan sort of magnanimity that is seen by Dante precisely as
^pusillo~ (meek), as St. Thomas also believed (^ST~ II-II, q. 129, a.
3).  Veglia might have referred to John Scott's book (^Dante magnanimo;
studi sulla "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1977]), which is a careful
study of various forms of magnanimity in Dante.  However, reversing a
recent trend in Italian Dante scholarship, which is to pay attention to
the work of foreign scholars, with the exception of E.G. Gardner's book
(^Dante and the Mystics~ [London: Dent, 1913]), Veglia does not mention
in his 60 footnotes any work written in English (nor, with the
exception of several French pieces, anyone who does not write in
Italian).

	|118-123.~  Now our ^archimandrita~, Francis (verse 99) is placed in
relation to Thomas, a ^patr,iarca~.  It is probably not accidental that
Peter, referred to as ^archimandrita~ in ^Monarchia~ (see the note to
verse 99), is mentioned here, as Dante obviously sees the first
^archimandrita~ and the second (Francis), as well as the new
^patr,iarca~ (Dominic), as all playing a major role in the shaping of
the Church, past and present, when the weakness and corruption in the
papacy made the mendicant orders especially necessary in his eyes.

The whole metaphorical passage is developed in nautical terms, in which
Peter is the first captain, followed by Francis and Dominic as
co-captains, of the Church.  She is portrayed as a merchant ship
(surprisingly, perhaps, until one thinks of the commercial metaphors
that are present in some of Jesus' parables), with a precious cargo in
its hold, the true believers who (we must assume) will be numbered
among the saved.

	|124-132.~  And now a switch in metaphor: Dominic's "sheep" are so
hungry for new food that they have become widely scattered; the farther
afield they go, the less milk they produce (i.e., the less their lives
give evidence of having taken in the lessons of life under the
Rule) when they finally return.  And, if a few keep close to
the shepherd, it does not take much cloth to have enough for their
cowls.  Thus does Thomas follow his praise of Francis with a
denunciation of his own Order, as Bonaventure will do for his fellow
Franciscans in the next canto (^Par~. XII.112-126).

For a consideration of the identical elements in these obviously paired
cantos, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XII.142-145.

	|133-135.~  Heavily rhetorical (three "if" clauses in as many lines),
the opening tercet of Thomas's conclusion draws Dante's attention back
to his words in the previous canto (see the note to verse 139).  Note
that Thomas does not say, in the final clause, "what I said," but "what
was said," in a painstakingly modest way of avoiding the use of the
first-person.

	|136-139.~  Thomas reminds Dante that he has been answering the first
of his unvoiced "doubts" (see vv. 22-25), caused by Thomas's phrasing
in the last canto (^Par~. X.96).

	|137.~  The word "plant" ^(pianta)~ introduces still another metaphor,
that of Dominic's Order as despoiled plant, the reason for which
defoliation Thomas has just made plain (vv. 124-132).

	|138.~  A dispute found in the commentaries involves the understanding
of the word ^corregger~, whether it is a noun ^(corregg$er)~, formed
from the noun ^correggia~, the Dominican equivalent of the Franciscan
^capestro~ (see the note to verse 87), and meaning "he who wears the
Dominican cincture," and thus, here, Thomas (a formulation first
proposed by Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv. 133-139], who, however,
believed the noun referred to Dominic, not Thomas).  This reading is
probably more than a little forced (e.g., would the poet have made
Thomas refer to himself as being seen by Dante? the word ^vedra' [=
vedrai]~  is better understood, in both its parallel uses in this
passage [see verse 137] as having the sense of "understand"), and most
today, following the self-styled "first modern commentator," Pompeo
Venturi, who, in the eighteenth century, found an equivalent for the
word ^corregger~ in "reprensione" (rebuke), think it is either a verb
or an infinitive used as a verbal noun, meaning, in the first case,
"correction" (we have translated it "rebuke") and, in the second,
"guidance."  And see Lombardi (comm. to vv. 138-139) for a return to
Buti's interpretation.  For his customary lengthy review (and also a
return to Buti), see Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 138-139).  However, see
the nearly equally lengthy treatment offered by Campi (comm. to vv.
136-139), opting for Venturi's solution, which is much as our own.
Since then, the basic disagreement lies between followers of
Buti/Scartazzini and Venturi/Campi, with most who deal with the problem
falling in behind Venturi/Campi.

	|139.~  Thomas, in good Thomistic fashion, rounds off his "gloss" on
^Paradiso~ X.96 by repeating the entire line here.

It is amusing to think that Dante's revenge on his major intellectual
rival in the debate over the truth-telling capacity of poetry comes
from making Thomas a commentator on Dante's poetry, a role that he
himself, perhaps prodded by Thomas's attacks on his profession, felt
called upon to play in his ^Epistle to Cangrande~.
