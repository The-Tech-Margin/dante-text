	|1-6.~  This simile is perhaps better described as two simple
comparisons combined into a single trope.  (Francesco da Buti [comm. to
vv. 1-21] did, however, describe it as a "similitudine.")  It first
compares Dante to a distressed child running to its mother and then
portrays Beatrice as a mother calming her child.  Poletto (comm. to vv.
1-3) was apparently the first to indicate the nearly certain reference
to ^Purg~. XXX.43-45 (Dante as child ^[fantolin]~ running to his mommy
^[mamma]~), but the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 1-3) pretty
clearly had been thinking of that same text.

These verses continue the action of the preceding canto, which ended
with Dante being unable to make out the meaning of a thunder-like
utterance (one of the loudest noises we hear from the pages of the
poem, perhaps bringing to mind the similarly stunning noise of the
infernal waterfall at ^Inferno~ XVI.94-105).  This shout emanated from
Peter Damian's outraged colleagues, departing from the silent
meditation that marked their presence once they descended toward this
sphere (see ^Par~. XXI.58).  Naturally enough, the protagonist, unable
to make out their words, fears lest their rebuke, so loud as to be
incomprehensible, be aimed at him.  His apparent logic is clear enough:
In this realm, if Beatrice does not smile and if the souls do not sing,
he must be being rebuked for something he has (or has not) done.

	|1.~  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 1-3) was perhaps the first to identify the
citation here of Boethius (^Cons.~ Phil. I.2[pr]): Philosophy appearing
to the befuddled "hero" at the beginning of that work (the two passages
share versions of the phrase ^stupor oppressit~).  Thus the text of the
^Consolatio~ stands behind Dantean expressions at either end of the
canto.  See the note to verse 151 (but also see the note to ^Par~.
XXI.28-30).  Zygmunt Baranski ("Canto XXII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 357) makes the telling point that Boethius
presents the Lady Philosophy's gown as bearing a ladder that moves from
lower practical matters to higher and theological concerns, an emblem
resembling the ladder we see here in Saturn, which configures both
ascent and descent, the life of meditation and of work in the world,
the monastic practices of meditation and labor.  (Benedict's "motto,"
as is reported by Fallani [comm. to verse 40], was "ora et labora"
[pray and work].)

	|4-6.~  Beatrice's increasing feminization (for her "male" attributes,
see ^Purg~. XXX.19, 43-48, 58, and the notes thereto) is, clearly, not
the sign of her sexualization, as some contrive to believe.  Never in
the poem does she appear as other than chaste, here, in simile, as
Dante's mother.

	|7-9.~  Beatrice corrects his misapprehension, explaining that anger in
the heavens cannot be produced by anything but righteous indignation
(^buon zelo~).  Thus the shout he heard could not have been directed
against him, but rather against those on earth who offend in their
desecration of the religious life, "li moderni pastori" (modern
shepherds [^Par~. XXI.131]).  Once again we are made to see how poorly
prepared this mortal is for this higher realm.

	|10-15.~  Beatrice explains that Dante's inability to comprehend the
"prayers" of the visitors to Saturn, prophesying God's vengeance on His
enemies, is in itself proof that he was not ready to bear either
Beatrice's beatific smile or the contemplatives' singing, both of which
were, for that reason, withheld from him.

	|10-12.~  Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-18) restates a passage in St.
Bernard's ^De Consideratione~ (V.xiv) that may throw considerable light
on this tercet: There are four kinds of divine judgments, each one
defined by its breadth, or length, or depth, or height.  Consideration
of God's judgments coincides with "depth."  Carroll continues: "This
kind of contemplation (now in Bernard's words) 'may violently shock the beholder with the
fearful vision, but it puts vice to flight, firmly bases virtue,
initiates in wisdom, preserves humility.'  It is plainly the shock of
this contemplation of the 'depth' which here stuns the Pilgrim.  The
cry is an echo from the Thrones of the Divine judgments who preside
over this Heaven, and the very echo shakes Dante to the soul; and
Beatrice asks how, if the 'depth' so shook him, he could have borne the
'height' -- the lofty ecstatic joy of contemplation represented by her
smile."

	|13-15.~  This sort of righteous indignation is itself a sort of joy,
since it involves, as Beatrice says, the celebration of just
punishment, visible in the vengeance of God, that Dante will be able to
observe on earth before he dies.  This "minor prophecy" (for another
see ^Purg~. XXIII.97-102) about the punishment of the corrupt clergy
resembles the similar promise (^Par~. XVII.98-99), made by Cacciaguida,
that Dante will witness the just punishment of his Florentine enemies.
How are we to take these "personal prophecies"?  It is perhaps best to
understand that both Cacciaguida's and this one spoken by Beatrice are
promissory notes Dante has written to himself.  He surely has in mind
the completion of his hope for the political redemption of Florence;
once this were accomplished, he was certain that his political enemies
and the corrupt clergy who seem to support them (and perhaps often did)
would come to a bad end indeed.  But like all successful prophecies,
this one had to provide at least some sure results in order to be taken
as veracious.  The death of any of Dante's major adversaries, occurring
while he was still alive, would indeed seem to make elements of these
"prophecies" correct.  On the religious side of the roster, major
deaths that succored Dante's hopes included those of the popes Boniface
VIII (1303) and Clement V (1314); in the secular ledger, that of Corso
Donati (1308 [see ^Purg~. XXIV.82-90]).  It may be argued convincingly
that, in fact, Dante did ^not~ triumph over his enemies; nonetheless,
he could, from the vantage point of 1317 or so, count on us to
recognize that some of his greatest foes had died, thus preserving, for
the moment, the possible happy outcome of this essentially botched
prediction.  It comes more as the result of wishful thinking (and the
accompanying conviction that his political views were simply correct)
than of revelation.

	|16-18.~  For Dante's enemies, obviously, this sword will make itself
felt all too soon, while for him it will be slow indeed in coming.

This feeling had already raced through Dante's veins.  Mattalia (comm.
to verse 16) indicates the second of Dante's "political epistles"
(^Ep~. VI.4, written in March of 1311), addressed to Henry VII, for the
sword of God and vendetta.  The text speaks of the "gladius Eius qui
dicit: 'Mea est ultio'" (the sword of Him who says, "Vengeance is
mine").

	|19-21.~  Beatrice's urging would lead us to believe that we shall
learn of the presence of at least a number of great contemplatives in
this sphere.  We shall, however, meet only one more, St. Benedict
(named only by periphrasis at verses 40-42), although he is accompanied
by two other named monastics, Macarius and Romuald (verse 49), who are
merely said to be here and must share a single line of verse.  The
others, of whom we are about to see many dozens, do not receive even
that much notice, a perhaps fitting anonymity in this environment of
self-abnegation.  For whatever reason, Dante has limited his panoply of
great contemplatives to Peter Damian and Benedict of Norcia, with an
assisting cast of only two named supporting players.

The phrasing of her command to Dante reflects similar urgings on
Virgil's part (^Inf~. IX.55, X.31; ^Purg~. XXVII.31-32) and one earlier
one by Beatrice herself (^Par~. XVIII.20).  The ability to turn and
face that which he fears or has not yet understood is what his two
guides both encourage in him.

	|20.~  For the phrase ^illustri spiriti~ (glorious spirits), Tommaseo
(comm. to vv. 19-21) adduces a Virgilian text (^Aen~. VI.758):
"inlustris animas."

	|23.~  These "one hundred little globes" are neither precisely one
hundred in number nor little globes, but a large number of descended
saints who, in their joy (we remember that they are spending eternity
in the most joyful place there is) make one another more joyous, as can
be perceived by their increasing brightness.

	|25-30.~  The protagonist, getting with the spirit of this place,
overrules "la punta del disio" (the spur of his desire) and suppresses
his desire to know who these spirits are -- but of course he has
communicated with them in God, despite his reticence.  One light, the
best and the brightest "pearl" among them, advances to reveal his
identity.

For a study of Dante's adaptation of sexually charged terms to express
the desire for God, see Lino Pertile ("'La punta del disio': storia di
una metafora dantesca," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 7 [1990]: 3-28),
using verse 26 as his point of departure.  And now see his book (^La
punta del disio: Semantica del desiderio nella "Commedia"~ [Fiesole:
Cadmo, 2005]), which includes this essay and builds upon it.

	|26.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 100, draws
this desire and that referred to at ^Paradiso~ XXI.48 into relation
with the ^disio~ mentioned in ^Inferno~ XXVI, first that of the
protagonist (verse 69), then that of Ulysses (his ^ardore~, verse 97),
and finally that of his shipmates (he has made them ^aguti [...] al
cammino~, vv. 121-122).

	|28-29.~  We know, as did those who painted and those who "read"
medieval paintings, that size is a measure of importance; this is,
accordingly, the most important personage of the group (as is also
underlined by his greater brightness among the ^margherite~ [pearls]
who make up his company).  Thus it is that Mary will be the greatest
among the flames (at least once Christ goes back to the Empyrean) seen
in the descended Church Triumphant (^Par~. XXIII.90).

Benedict will make his identity knowable (he will not actually name
himself then or ever) at vv. 40-42.  See the note to vv. 37-45.

	|31-36.~  Once again a personage of Paradise alludes to the fact that
speech is here an unnecessary form of communication (to any
understanding but that of mortal Dante).  The speaker assures him that,
had he only known the inner dispositions of these "globes," he would
have spoken up (even as we remind ourselves that there obviously was no
need to, since they know his thoughts even as he suppresses his desire
to give voice to them).

	|31.~  For the extraordinary number of verbs of seeing in this canto
(twenty-one), all but two of them referring to Dante's sight, see
Baranski ("Canto XXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
344n.).

	|37-45.~  Benedict (480-543), born in the Umbrian city of Norcia,
became the founder of what is considered the oldest monastic order in
the West, which bears his name.  Son of wealthy parents, he went to
Rome to study, and there witnessed the debauchery of the clergy.  His
response was to take up a solitary eremitic life in a cave.  His fame
brought him the attention of those who had chosen to live a cloistered
life.  He agreed to become the head of the convent of Vicovaro, thus
moving from the existence of a hermit to that of a cenobite.  This was
not in all respects a propitious decision on his part, since his fellow
monks, resentful of his extremely strict Rule, tried to poison him.  He
managed to survive the attempt on his life and once again retreated to
his cave.  Monks loyal to him and to his vision of the cenobitic life
eventually followed him to Montecassino, where he destroyed a temple of
Apollo and a grove sacred to Venus (according to Oelsner [comm. to vv.
37-39]), converted the locals (until his advent, still pagans), and
founded his order.  As commentators point out, beginning with Jacopo
della Lana (^Nota~ to this canto), Dante's brief version of Benedict's
^vita~ is indebted to that found in his biographer, St. Gregory the
Great, ^Dialogues~, II.2.  It may seem surprising that Benedict was
canonized only in 1220, nearly seven centuries after his death, while
Francis had to wait only two years for his sainthood (1228).

	|39.~  The adjectives assigned to the indigenous pagan locals pretty
clearly seem to distinguish between, in Tommaseo's view (comm. to vv.
37-39), their confused mental state and their misdirected affections
(in Oelsner's formulation [see the note to vv. 37-45], worship of
Apollo and devotions to Venus).

	|45.~  As opposed to verse 39, which seems to point to two unacceptable
forms of behavior among the locals, this one would rather indicate the
worship of Apollo alone, even if a more universal victory over paganism is probably indicated.

	|46-48.~  Once again (see the note to verse 1) the text indicates the
special nature of the monastic vocation, a combination of prayerful
meditation and labor, in Benedict's own prescription for cenobitic
activity, "ora et labora."

The souls that Dante had in mind as models for this kind of ecstatic
appreciation of God are, according to Claudia Di Fonzo ("'La dolce
donna dietro a lor mi pinse / con un sol cenno su per quella scala'
[^Par~. XXII.100-101]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 {1997}]: 141-75),
Anselm, Benedict, Bonaventure, and (especially) Bernard.

	|48.~  Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 37-51) resolves the metaphoric
^fiori~ (flowers) and ^frutti~ (fruits) into "words" and "deeds."  It
seems at least possible, given Benedict's own division of monkish
occupation into prayer and work, that this is how we should interpret
the "flowers" that Dante has in mind: the words that give shape to
prayer.

	|49.~  Saints Macarius and Romuald were surely also monks, but,
especially with regard to the first, there is little certainty as to
his absolute identity.  For Macarius, the two main candidates were both
dead before Benedict was born.  "It is uncertain which of the several
saints of the name of Macarius is the one intended by Dante.  The two
best known, between whom perhaps Dante did not very clearly
distinguish, are St. Macarius the Elder, called the Egyptian, and St.
Macarius the Younger of Alexandria -- both disciples of St. Anthony.
St. Macarius the Elder (born in 301) retired at the age of 30 into the
Libyan desert, where he remained for sixty years, passing his time
between prayer and manual labour, until his death, at the age of 90, in
391.  St. Macarius the Younger had nearly 5,000 monks under his charge
(d. 404); he is credited with having established the monastic rule of
the East, as St. Benedict did that of the West" (Toynbee, "Macario"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

As for St. Romuald (956-1027), he began (in 1012) the Camaldolese
Order, a reformed group of Benedictines.  It was named for the donor of
its holding, ^campus Maldoli~ (the field of Maldolus), or "Camaldoli."
(Its monastery, in Tuscany, is referred to in ^Purgatorio~ V.96.)  Thus
Benedict is bracketed, chronologically, by a precursor and a follower.
Dante may have learned about Romuald, born in Ravenna, from the ^vita
Romualdi~ composed by his townsman, Peter Damian.

	|50-51.~  It sounds as though Benedict is readying himself to give a
denunciation of the corruption of his order, in the style of Peter
Damian (^Par~. XXI.130-135); however, Dante interrupts him with a
surprising question, one that detains him for some time; he will
deliver his broadside only at vv. 73-96.

See Annibale Ilari ("Il Canto XXII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp. 573-624) for the
view that Dante's sense of the purpose of the monastic life,
particularly in its Benedictine form, was shaped by the sense of
monasticism that he found in the writings of Joachim of Flora.

	|52-54.~  The protagonist allows that he has interpreted (correctly)
his temporary companions' increased brightness as an expression of
their affection for him.

	|58-60.~  Benedict is awarded the role of Dante's penultimate "father"
in this poem, with only St. Bernard to come (for the others, see the
note to ^Par~. XVI.16).

He also has the honor of preceding St. John (see ^Par~. XXV.122-129)
in causing Dante to ask questions about the fleshly aspect of the
condition of the blessed.  There also circulated a medieval legend that
St. John, for his particular closeness to Jesus, was unique among the
rest of the blessed (Jesus and Mary being the sole other exceptions) in
having his resurrected body in Heaven before the general resurrection
(see Rachel Jacoff ["Dante and the Legend(s) of St. John," ^Dante
Studies~ 117 {1999}: 45-57]).  Dante's curiosity about Benedict's
actual appearance, however, has no ascertainable "source," at least none
supported by Dante's commentators.  In the case of Benedict, the
protagonist's question (and his desire) is somewhat different.  He
would like to see Benedict ^now~ as he shall be when he is found again,
seated in Heaven (^Par~. XXXII.35), that is, with his sheathing flame
removed so that his face's features will be utterly plain to a
beholder.  Once in the Empyrean, Dante will see ^all~ the blessed as
though they had already been given back their fleshly selves (^Par~.
XXX.43-45), that is, even before the general resurrection.  Thus he
will there experience the reality of Benedict and of John (and of all
the other saints) in identical ways.

Why, the commentators are left to ask, does Dante introduce this
concern here, one that seems to have no historical footing?  The least
that one can hazard is that, given his "fatherhood" and this
exceptional request, Benedict played a more vital role in Dante's
intellectual and spiritual development than has been ascertained, if in
what precise ways remains unknown.

Kevin Brownlee points out ("Ovid's Semele and Dante's Metamorphosis:
^Paradiso~ 21-22," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991], pp. 227-28) that Dante's desire to
see Benedict in his flesh uncomfortably parallels Semele's request to
Jove, but that he will see Benedict as though resurrected in the flesh
in ^Paradiso~ XXXII.35.  His story, unlike hers, has a happy ending.

	|61-72.~  At some length Benedict corrects the supposition that lay
behind Dante's desire to see him in his true human resemblance.  His
conclusion, with its reference to Jacob's Ladder and its function as
the connecting point between the rest of the time-bound universe and
the unchanging Empyrean, brings his attention back to his monks, last
heard of at verse 51.

	|61.~  This represents the last use of the word "brother" ^(frate)~ as
a term of address in the poem.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ IV.127.

See Carroll (comm. to vv. 61-63) for the notion (attributed only to
Chimenz [comm. to vv. 61-63] by Bosco/Reggio [comm. to this verse])
that Benedict is gently reproving Dante for having called him "father"
(verse 58) by insisting that they are better considered brothers in
Christ.  Compare the desire of Pope Adrian V ^not~ to have Dante kneel
before him in obeisance, since they enjoy a similar brotherhood
(^Purg~. XIX.133-135).

	|64.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 101, points
out that, rather than redundant through some failing on the poet's
part, as some commentators hold, these three adjectives reproduce a
phrase in an apostolic epistle (James 1:4): "And let steadfastness have
its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in
nothing" ^(perfecti et integri, in nullo deficientes)~.  The only other
reference to this passage (if not in this context) in the entire
commentary tradition seems to be found in Bernardino Daniello (comm. to
^Par~. XXV.29).

	|67.~  The Empyrean ^non s'impola~ (does not turn on poles), as does
the terrestrial globe and as do the planets, but is the place that T.S.
Eliot might have described as "the still point of the turning world"
(the phrase occurs once in the second section of "Burnt Norton," the
first of the ^Four Quartets~, and once again in the fourth).

	|68-69.~  This ladder "mounts right up to it," that is, to the
Empyrean, which is why Dante cannot yet see its terminus.

	|70-72.~  The tercet puts into play, in case we have missed it, the
reference to Genesis 28:12: "And he dreamed, and behold, there was a
ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven.  And
behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it."

	|73-87.~  Beginning with the foot of Jacob's Ladder, as it were,
Benedict now rounds on the current members of his order.  Their degeneracy
is reflected in the crumbling physical plant of the monastery; in the
attempt to find ^some~ use for the cowls of the monks (since apparently
those who wear them are few) as bags for flour; in the flagrant usury
employed by them (^quel frutto~, the disgraceful "harvest" of their
misguided lavoro). On this last charge, see Tozer (comm. to vv. 79-84),
describing it as "covetousness in misappropriating the revenues of the
Church, which rightfully belong to God's poor, to the purposes of nepotism
and licentiousness.  This in the sight of God is a worse sin than usury."

Benedict's remarks come to momentary cessation in the image of human
sinfulness quickly undoing even fresh and worthy initiatives; these are
snuffed out soon after inception.

	|77.~  Christ, driving the moneychangers from the temple (Matthew
21:12-13), portrays them as turning His "house of prayer" into a "den
of thieves" ^(speluncam latronum)~, as was noted by John of Serravalle
(comm. to vv. 76-78).  Dante's ^spelonche~ nearly certainly reflects
that passage.

	|85-87.~  Oaks take a while to grow mature enough to produce acorns -
twenty years, according to Jacopo della Lana (comm. to this tercet) and
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 73-87).  However, Dante seems to be
underlining the relative brevity of their acornless state.  Sapegno
(comm. to this tercet) looks forward to a similar sense of the brief
durance, there of innocence among us humans, at ^Paradiso~
XXVII.121-138.

	|88-96.~  In the first of these three tercets, Benedict reviews high
points in the establishments of communities within the Church: the
apostle Peter's first "papacy" (first century); the founding of his own
order (sixth century); the founding of Francis's (twelfth century).
The reader has a clear sense that Benedict does not expect any major
renewal in the Church.  And yet his speech ends with a curiously
optimistic (and typically Dantean) reversal, in the promise of better
days, with which his harangue comes to its close.  If bodies of water
could have been halted in their flow to let the Hebrews cross to
safety, as Psalms 113:3 (114:5) attests, that would still seem a
greater miracle than if God were to intervene in the world now.  In
short, as unlikely as that possibility seems, its odds are shorter than
they were for the miracles of Jordan and of the Red Sea.  In Dante's
scheme of things, there is always room for hope, a view that we will
find again in ^Paradiso~ XXVII.142-148, in a passage that similarly
surmounts a decidedly pessimistic view of human sinfulness with hopes
for a better world in the near future.

	|88.~  See the relevant passage in Acts 3:6: "Petrus autem dicit:
Argentum et aurum non est mihi" (But Peter said, "Silver and gold have
I none"), its relevance first suggested in the ^Chiose ambrosiane~
(comm. to this verse).

	|89.~  A possible ^arri@ere pens$ee~ of Ugolino (^Inf~. XXXIII.75), who
knew ^digiuno~ (fasting) all too well, but prayer too little.  See the
note to ^Inferno~ XXXIII.49.

	|93.~  See ^Paradiso~ XXVII.136 for a similar description of a thing
changed into its opposite, in that case, innocence into sinfulness.

	|94-96.~  God's miracles (Joshua 3:14-17), Jordan turned back and
(Exodus 14:21-29) the crossing of the Red Sea (both remembered in
Psalms 113:3 [114:5]), will have accustomed the eventual witnesses of
His vengeance against these prelates to see that such relatively minor
miracles are also signs of His power.

	|97-99.~ The departure of Benedict and his fellow monastics, headed
back "home," to the Empyrean at the upper end of Jacob's Ladder, where,
we may assume, they will no longer think of the world's many
corruptions, is accompanied by a whirlwind, sign of God's power and of
His love for these saints.

	|100-111.~  In their wake, Beatrice leads Dante up the "ladder," not
yet to Benedict's companions' goal, the Empyrean, but to the eighth of
the nine heavenly spheres, that of the Fixed Stars.  The ascent is
brief and briefly described, but the point of arrival will be treated
at greater length.

	|100.~  This verse lies at the boundary line of the next heaven.  Since
in the Starry Sphere Dante will experience the Church Triumphant, has
the poet used this perfect number as the number of its border
deliberately?

	|102.~  Andreoli (comm. to this verse) paraphrases as follows: "the
natural gravity of my body."  Is this an admission that Dante indeed
visited the heavens in the body?  However, it could suggest that the
protagonist thinks of himself in corporeal terms out of habit.  But see
the note to ^Paradiso~ I.73.

	|106-111.~  Dante apostrophizes us (for the distribution of the
addresses to the reader throughout the poem, see the notes to ^Inf~.
VIII.94-96 and to ^Par~. X.22-27) for the final time in the poem (as
Tommaseo noted).  It comes as a surprise of some magnitude when one
reads Scartazzini on this passage (comm. to verse 106) and finds that
stubbornly thorough assembler of data coming up several addresses to
the reader short in his quick survey.  He undercounts occurrences of
the phenomenon by two in ^Inferno~ and by two again here in the third
^cantica~.  Are we to think it a coincidence that this last occurrence
falls just before the first of the final triad of invocations, now
to higher powers directly (God's creative powers in the stars and
then the Deity Itself in ^Par~. XXX and XXXIII)?  It is as though the
poet is underlining the distance between human and divine experience
by leaving us behind.  After Dante looks down through the planets,
the next sight he will see is the Church Triumphant, which we will see
again in the penultimate canto of the poem.  For all of the next canto,
for the last third of the thirtieth, and for all the final three we are
seeing "face-to-face."	As the space travelers near their eventual goal,
the time taken for the ascent from sphere to sphere decreases, since the
"gravitational pull" of the Empyrean naturally increases as one nears it.
[Note revised 24 August 2013; see the revised note to ^Par.~ IX.10-12.]

	|109-111.~  The poet allows us to learn, inferentially, where his visit
to the Starry Sphere has been situated by Providence, in "the sign
following the Bull" (Taurus), and thus in Gemini, the sign under which,
in 1265, he was born and which shaped whatever genius he possesses.
With Gemini the Sun rose and set the day Dante was born in Tuscany; and
now he comes to this heaven in that constellation.  (Singleton [cited
in the note to ^Par~. XXII.127-154] cites an interesting observation of
Grandgent's: "Thus, in a spiritual sense, [Dante] returns, like Plato's
departed, to his native star: cf. ^Par~. IV.52-57.")  From the stars of
Gemini he invokes aid in acquiring the necessary capacity to tell of
the final things of Heaven, beginning in the next canto with the
appearance of the "hosts of Christ's triumph" (^Par~. XXIII.20-21).

	|109-110.~  The by now fairly familiar trope ^hysteron proteron~ is
used to describe the speed of their upward movement and attainment of
the next sphere.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ I.23-26.

	|112-123.~  Adding to the reader's sense of the poet's
self-consciousness at this moment in his creation, this seventh
invocation also underlines the importance of the visit to the stars
that shaped his human abilities.  In ^Inferno~ II.7, when Dante invoked
^alto ingegno~ for aid, it is at least possible that he was invoking
God's power to help him make his poem (see the notes to ^Inf~. II.7-9
and ^Par~. XXV.2).  Here, especially in light of the equation between
God's powers and that of the heavenly spheres suggested by ^Paradiso~ II.9,
Dante would seem to be aligning his own powers as a poet with those
specifically allotted him by God through the agency of the alignment of
the stars at his birth, when the Sun ("he who is father to all mortal
life") was under the sign of Gemini.

This is the seventeenth (of eighteen in all) appearance of the word
^ingegno~ in the poem.  The next and last (^Par~. XXIV.81), in the
biting phrase "ingegno di sofista," offers us the picture of those who
used their "genius" perversely, and to widely different ends.

	|121-123.~  The actual invocation occurs only now, as the first three
tercets of the passage define the power of these stars and give the
nature and history of Dante's relationship with them.  What is the
specific "daunting task" for which the poet seeks heavenly aid?  Most
commentators are content to see this as a general appeal, called for by
the heightening of the poem's subject, rising above the realms in which
Dante and we are allowed to see the temporarily present souls of saved
mortals and looking forward to the final vision in the poem's final
canto.  This seems a sensible view.  (For a review of the varied [and
rather vague or general] interpretations offered through the nineteenth
century, see Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 122-123].)  Del Lungo (comm. to
this tercet) offers a stronger reading, arguing that the specific
appeal is made for a specific reason: Dante in the next canto must
describe the triumph presided over by Christ and Mary.  Indeed, in
Canto XXIII the protagonist will be seeing "face-to-face."  And what he
will see is the ultimate destination of the justified portion of our
race, the Church Triumphant, which will descend from the Empyrean in
order to make itself visible to a mortal (for the first [and only!]
time in human history, we may embarrassedly consider).  And thus this
invocation is "special" for that reason.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this
tercet) make two questionable gestures, first attributing this
interpretation to Chimenz rather than to Del Lungo, who preceded him;
second, casting doubt upon it.  Having made it, the poet reports first
on his downward glance, as he readies himself to see better things; the
passage describing that vision will complete this canto.  In the next,
the intricate opening simile leads directly into the vision of the
Church Triumphant, the first thing above him that Dante will describe
after the invocation (see ^Par~. XXIII.19-21, Beatrice's words, "Now
look upon the hosts / of Christ in triumph, all the fruit / gathered
from the wheeling of these spheres!").  It is with this immediate
destination in mind that one might want to understand the "clue" to
such an understanding found in Beatrice's earlier statement, a few
lines farther on in this canto, at verse 124 ("You are so near the
final blessedness"), as a reference ^not~ to his eventual destination
in the Empyrean, as most imagine it to be, but in fact to this
immediately proximate vision of the citizenry of that place in the next
canto.  In fact, the vast majority of commentators believe the passage
looks forward only to the last canto, drawn by the phrase ^ultima
salute~, for God, in ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.27.  Only Trucchi (comm. to vv.
124-126) resists this "easy" solution, seeing that the presence of
Christ in the next one is what is at stake.

Of similar effect is Beatrice's ensuing remark (vv. 131-132),
encouraging Dante to look back to see how much heavenly territory he
has already traversed, a journey that makes him ready to appear before
"the triumphant throng / that comes rejoicing to this celestial
sphere."  In light of such indications, it seems more than likely that
the invocation is meant to be read as a preparation for that
near-at-hand experience, not one some ten cantos distant.

	|123.~  The phrase "passo forte" (daunting task) caught Benvenuto's
attention (comm. to vv. 121-123).  Why is it so?  "Because," Benvenuto
says, "here is that which all things strive toward.  In what follows
[Dante] describes God's Church in its triumph, with all the celestial
court, including God."

	|124-129.~  See Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle ("Closure in Paradise: Dante
Outsings Aquinas," ^Modern Language Notes~ 115 [2000]: 3-5) on Dante's
awareness of Thomas's failure to complete his three-part ^Summa~ and
consequent diminution in comparison with Dante's tripartite poem.  She
continues by claiming that the ^Comedy~ uses both agricultural and
navigational metaphors to demonstrate that poetry is more fitting than
philosophy or theology to articulate "the ascent to divine
contemplation."  While her sense of Dante's hostility to Thomas is
surely overblown, she is among those who realize that all is not
peaches and cream in Dante's presentation of his relations with Thomas.

	|124-126.~  Beatrice is not so much admonishing Dante to prepare his
eyes for such exalted vision as insisting that, trained as they have
been, they are now necessarily ready for that vision, and will be so
for the duration of his visit to the rest of the heavens and to the
Empyrean.  This is to agree with Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet).
For the sense in which Dante is at this moment near his "final
blessedness," see the note to vv. 121-123.

	|127.~  Dante's neologism here is close to untranslatable.  The coinage
is possibly to be taken as a verb of the first conjugation,
"inleiarsi," to "in-it oneself," that is, to make oneself one with
something external to one's being.

	|129.~  Beatrice's reference to the great extent of the universe that
Dante can now make out "beneath his feet" reminds us again that we are
still not sure whether we are meant to understand that Dante is in
^Paradiso~ in the flesh.  While something like certainty awaits us, as
will be made clear in a few cantos, here we sense a certain coyness.
Beatrice may be speaking figuratively, meaning "Look down beneath you,
where your feet would be if you were here in the flesh."  Or she may
simply be saying, "Look beneath your feet," feet that are really there,
dangling beneath him in the heaven of the Fixed Stars.

	|131-132.~  Once again Beatrice clearly alludes to what Dante will see
next, in the verses early in the next canto (19ff.), the Church
Triumphant, having left Heaven to appear to Dante in this heaven.

	|132.~  The word ^etera~, literally translated, means "(a)ether," in
Aristotle's sense of the "fifth element," as understood by Jacopo della
Lana (comm. to vv. 130-132), that which composes the "stuff" of which a
celestial sphere consists and in which other bodies (e.g., the stars)
are contained.  It is thus differentiated from both stars (and what we
refer to as planets) and nothingness (what we used to refer to as
"space").

	|133-153.~  This remarkable passage is almost as interesting in its
antecedence as in its immediate progeny.  There are similar scenes in
Boccaccio's ^Filostrato~ and ^Teseida~; Chaucer visits both of these,
in the moment that is perhaps central to the understanding of his
intentions for the ending of the ^Troilus~; and both writers evidently
pay close attention to Dante as well as to his and their classical
precursors.  While there continues to be debate about Dante's
first-hand knowledge of the portion of Cicero's lost ^De re publica~
known as the "Dream of Scipio," it really does seem to most that Dante
knew this text (VI.xvi.16).  On the other hand, there is and can be no
debate about his knowledge of the similar passage in Boethius's ^De
consolatione~ (II.m7.1-6), if that seems less directly resemblant.
(Singleton [comm. to vv. 127-154] presents both texts, with English
translations.)  In Cicero, Dante's great Roman hero Scipio, appearing
in a dream to his grandson after his death, speaks of this paltry
world, seen from the heavens, in much the same tone as we find here; in
Boethius, there is a vision of this narrow earth.

	|134.~  Some readers may benefit from a reminder: For Dante the seven
"planets" circling over our earth are Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn.  All the stars are contained in the next sphere,
the heaven of the Fixed Stars, to which point the protagonist has just
now risen (see vv. 100-111).

	|139-150.~  Dante examines the planets beneath his feet; these
are seen in a somewhat unusual order and are mainly named by their
"parents": (1) Moon (daughter of Latona), (4) Sun (son of Hyperion),
(2) Mercury (son of Maia), (3) Venus (daughter of D,ione), (6) Jupiter
(son of Saturn), (7) Saturn, (5) Mars (son of Jupiter).

Carroll (comm. to these verses) makes a helpful distinction between St.
Bernard's terms ^consideratio~ and ^contemplatio~: "St. Bernard (^De
Consideratione~ [II.ii]) thus distinguishes: '^Contemplation~ may be
defined as the soul's true unerring intuition, or as the unhesitating
apprehension of truth.  But ^consideration~ is thought (^cogitatio~)
earnestly directed to research, or the application of the mind to the
search for truth; though in practice the two terms are indifferently
used for one another' (Lewis' transl.).  Both words are believed to
come from augurial rites: Contemplation, from ^com~ and ^templum~, the
marking out of a ^templum~, or sacred space open to the sky; and
consideration, from ^com~ and ^sidus~ (^sideris~) a star, or
constellation, observation of the stars."  In Bernard's language then,
Dante is "considering" the stars; contemplation of God remains ahead of
him.

	|139-141.~  The reference is, obviously, to the Moon (Latona's
daughter, Diana) and to Dante's earlier misprisions of the reasons for
its differing degrees of brightness (see ^Par~. II.49-51).  Now that he
is seeing her from "behind," from the side turned away from earth, her
surface is uniform in appearance.

	|142-143.~  Dante's improved eyesight (see vv. 124-126) quickly bestows
a new benefit: He can look directly at the Sun, the son of Hyperion in
some classical myths, including Ovid's (^Metam~. IV.192).

	|144.~  Referring to them by the names of their mothers, Dante sees
Mercury (Maia) and Venus (D,ione).  The literal sense of this tercet
has caused problems; Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 143-144) propose a
reading that is mirrored in our translation.

	|145-146.~  Perhaps the best gloss available for these verses was
written by Dante himself (^Conv~. II.xiii.25): "The heaven of Jupiter
may be compared to Geometry because of two properties: one is that it
moves between two heavens that are antithetical to its fine temperance,
namely that of Mars and that of Saturn; consequently Ptolemy says, in
the book referred to [Dante mentions his ^Quadripartitus~ in section
21], that ^Jupiter is a star of temperate constitution between the cold
of Saturn and the heat of Mars~; the other is that among all the stars
it appears white, almost silvery" ([italics added] tr. R. Lansing).

	|146.~  Saturn, the father of Jupiter, thus lent his name to the only
planet that cannot be named by a parent.

	|148-150.~  From his vantage point in the eighth celestial sphere,
Dante is now able to observe the relationships among the seven planets
(see the note to verse 134) with regard to their varying sizes, the
differing speeds of their rotations around the earth, and the distances
between their ^ripari~, that is what medieval astronomers refer to as
their "houses," or their stations in the heavens.

	|151.~  The word "aiuola," frequently translated as "threshing floor,"
is almost without a doubt, as John Scott ("^Paradiso~ 22.151: 'L'aiuola
che ci fa tanto feroci': Philology and Hermeneutics," ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [April 2003]) has argued,
without the biblical resonance of Matthew 3:12 and Luke 3:17 that is
heard by some from the nineteenth century into our own time.  He also
believes that the word reflects its presence in a phrase found in
Boethius's ^De consolatione~, II.7[pr], ^angustissima... area~.  Scott
cites Kay (^Dante's "Monarchia,"~ translated, with a commentary, by
Richard Kay [Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1998],
p. 317, n. 22), glossing ^Monarchia~ III.xvi.11, where Dante uses the
Latin equivalent of "aiuola": "Latin ^areola~ is a diminutive form of
^area~, and hence is 'a little space'" (see also Emilio Pasquini,
"Canto XXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], p. 439).  (For the
long-standing but frequently overlooked knowledge of the reference to
Boethius, see first Pietro di Dante [Pietro1, comm. to vv. 145-150] and
then Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv. 149-154], who are joined by
several later practitioners, including Landino, Daniello, and Tommaseo.
 Longfellow [comm. to this verse] gets the Boethius right but is
responsible [according to Scott] for the invention of "threshing floor"
in his translation.)  This rendering of the word has had a long run,
and may in fact still need winnowing.  Scott continues: "Dante uses it
here in this general, etymological sense, although often both ^areola~
and its Italian calc ^aiuola~ are used for specific small spaces, e.g.
a flowerbed, seedbed, open courtyard, threshing floor, or even a blank
space on a page [...].  Dante probably had in mind Boethius's
description of the inhabitable world as an 'angustissimum [sic]...
area' (^Cons.~ Phil. II.7[pr].3), which Dante echoed in ^Epist~.
[VII.15]: 'in angustissima mundi area' [in such a narrow corner of the
world]." And see Dante's second use of ^aiuola~ at ^Paradiso~ XXVII.86.

However, for a biblical use of ^area~ to mean "threshing floor," see
Daniel 2:35, "aestivae areae": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze,
the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and
became like the chaff of the ^summer threshing floors~; and the wind
carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found.  But the
stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the
whole earth."  This is the stuff of Dante's vision of the Old Man of
Crete in ^Inferno~ XIV.  One can understand the temptation to read this
passage in light of that one.  And see Carroll (comm. to vv. 151-154),
who is aware that the word ^area~ can mean other things, but argues
here for the resonance of Jeremiah 51:33, where it clearly does mean
"threshing floor."  However, on balance, the cooler heads of Kay and
Scott should probably be allowed to regulate the overheated rhetorical
enthusiasm that, as Scott argues, perhaps has its Anglo-Saxon origin in
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Romantic view of this verse.

Gian Biagio Conte (see ^Atene e Roma~ 22, fasc. 3-4 [1977]: 162, his
review of Alfonso Traina's article), citing Traina's previous
observation (in "'L'aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci': per la storia di un
topos," in his ^Poeti latini [e neolatini]: note e saggi filosofici~
[Bologna: P@atron, 1975], pp. 305-35), has suggested that a line in the
proem of Seneca's ^Naturales Quaestiones~ ("puntum... in quo bellatis,
in quo regno disponitis") perhaps furnished the substance of this
thought.  Conte goes on to add his own sense that Lucan (^Phars~.
IX.14) supplied the phrasing for Dante's expression of his scorn for
the affairs of this paltry earth.  However, it seems clear that, in the
this verse (which is what most directly concerns us here), Dante is
closer to Boethius than to Seneca.

	|152-154.~  Because of the high-speed revolution of the celestial
sphere in which he is currently lodged, the protagonist is able to see all of the
physical contour of our earth.  He does so without particular
enthusiasm, and is quick to turn his eyes back to the eyes of Beatrice,
which are undoubtedly to be understood as gazing up toward God and not
down toward Dante's (and our) paltry patch of earth.

For the relationship among this concluding passage of the canto and
^Convivio~ III.v.3-8, Dante's ^Questio~, the ^Somnium Scipionis~, as
well as Honorius of Autun's ^Imago mundi~, see Francesco Mazzoni
("Dante 'misuratore di mondi.'" in ^Dante e la scienza~, ed. P. Boyde
and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], p. 44).

This passage inevitably leads a reader to wonder exactly how much time
Dante spent in the heavens (and in the Empyrean).  He left our
terrestrial globe at noon on Wednesday (either 30 March or 13 April in
the year 1300, as the reader will recall [see the note to ^Inf~. I.1]).
 How long was he in Paradise?  When did he come "home"?  For
discussion, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVII.79-81.
