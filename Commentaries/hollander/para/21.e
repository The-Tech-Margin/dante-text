	|1-4.~  As has always been the case (^Par~. I.64-66 [Moon]; V.88-96
[Mercury]; VIII.14-15 [Venus]; X.37-39 [Sun]; XIV.79-84 [Mars];
XVIII.52-57 [Jupiter]; and in these verses), as he ascends to a new
heaven, Dante fixes his eyes on Beatrice's face so that nothing else
can attract his attention.  And it will be much the same in the three
ascents still before him (^Par~. XXII.97-105 [Starry Sphere];
XXVII.88-96 [Crystalline Sphere]; XXX.14-27 [Empyrean]).  In most of
these moments, Beatrice is either explicitly or indirectly portrayed as
smiling (except in the first, fourth, seventh, and eighth of these
passages).  This time, however, there is something quite different
about the heavenly guide's disposition, as we discover in the following
tercet: For the first time in this situation, an ascent to the next
celestial heaven, Beatrice is rather pointedly ^not~ smiling.  The
little mystery that this fact engenders is left for Peter Damian to
resolve (see vv. 61-63).

	|5-12.~  The reference to Ovid's Semele (^Metam~. III.256-315) may at
first seem out of place in this context (as it did not when it occurred
in ^Inf~. XXX.1-2, where the vengeance of God upon the counterfeiters
is compared to the vengeance taken by Juno upon Semele).  "Semele,
daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes; she was beloved by Jupiter, by whom
she became the mother of Bacchus.  Juno, in order to avenge herself
upon Jupiter, appeared to Semele in the disguise of her aged nurse
Beroe, and induced her to ask Jupiter to show himself to her in the
same splendour and majesty in which he appeared to Juno.  Jupiter,
after warning Semele of the danger, complied with her request, and
appeared before her as the god of thunder, whereupon she was struck by
lightning and consumed to ashes" (Toynbee, ^Concise Dante Dictionary~,
"Semele").  Here, Beatrice, as Jove, withholds her sovereign and
celestial beauty from her mortal "lover" until such time as he will be
able to bear her divine beauty.  Thus Ovid's "tragic" tale, embellished
with a Christian and "comic" conclusion, is rewritten; unlike Semele,
Dante will become capable of beholding the immortals face-to-face.  See
Kevin Brownlee ("Ovid's Semele and Dante's Metamorphosis: ^Paradiso~
21-22," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of
Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford
University Press, 1991], pp. 224-32, 293-94) for a discussion in this
vein, also demonstrating that this myth functions as the "spine" of the
narrative of Dante's spiritual growth in this heaven.  And see Manuele
Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame
University Press, 2005], p. 175) for the view that Semele's mortality
is a sign of the protagonist's similar condition, that is, further
evidence that he is present in the flesh.

Scartazzini (comm. to verse 6) was apparently the first (but hardly the
last) commentator also to refer to Statius (^Theb~. III.184-185), for
the burning of Semele into ashes.  Margherita Frankel reports Colin
Hardie's comment on this verse (from a letter) to the effect that
Beatrice is the anti-Juno protecting Dante, the new Aeneas, while Juno,
who destroyed Semele, was the sworn enemy of Aeneas.

	|8.~  The phrase ^l'etterno palazzo~ (eternal palace) recalls,
according to Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~],
^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 94,
the ^domus Dei~ (house of God) mentioned by Jacob (Gen. 28:17) in a
passage not distant from the one describing his dream of the ladder, so
prominently visited in this canto.  See the note to vv. 28-30.

	|10.~  The verb ^temperasse~ strikes Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses
to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11
September 2001), p. 94, as establishing the thematic core of this
heaven, temperance.

	|13-15.~  Beatrice announces that they have arrived in the seventh
heaven, that of Saturn, characterized, as we shall find, by monastic
silence.  As the tenth canto of this ^cantica~ marked a transition to a
higher realm (from the sub-solar heavens of Moon, Mercury, and Venus),
so does this canto lift the pilgrim into a still higher realm, beyond
that dedicated to the praise of those associated with knowledge, just
warfare, and just rulership, for Dante the highest forms of human
activity in this world.  Contemplation, as a form of direct contact
with divinity, is thus marked off as a still higher form of human
activity, one that itself borders on the divine.  The major exemplary
figures in this realm, Peter Damian and Benedict, are presented as,
even during their lives on earth, having been nearly angelic in their
comprehension, if, however, maintaining contact with the ordinary in
their daily rituals of monastic labor (a monastery was, among other
things, a sort of single-sex farming community).  The eighth sphere
will present us with still holier humans, writers of the Christian
Bible (Saints Peter, James, and John), while in the ninth we find the
reflection of the angelic intelligences.  Thus we are here entering the
final triad in the poet's tripartite division of the created universe.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 14-15) explain that Saturn, in conjunction
with the constellation Leo in March-April 1300, now irradiates its
influence, mixed with that of the constellation, down to the earth.
They go on to say that the image "beneath the burning Lion's breast"
reflects Ptolemy's description of Regulus, the star of first magnitude
in the constellation Leo, as ^cor leonis~ (the heart of the lion).
They conclude by pointing out that, both here and in ^Par~. XVI.39, the
poet would seem to ascribe a certain heat-producing capacity to the
constellation itself, if he might better have confined that capacity to
the Sun.  Was Saturn in Leo in March-April 1300?  Some have argued that
this condition pertained only in 1301 and that the actual date of the
voyage is that year, not 1300.  But see the note to ^Purgatorio~
I.19-21.

For a thumbnail history of contemplation, from Plato to Peter Damian,
with which Dante associates this heaven, see Georges G,untert ("Canto
XXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 325-27).

	|16-18.~  See Carroll (comm. ^ad loc.~) for the following deep
analysis of this innocent-seeming tercet: "'Fix behind thine eyes thy mind,
and make of those ^mirrors~ to the figure in this ^mirror~ (i.e. Saturn)
which shall be to thee apparent.' In plain words, Dante is conscious that even
yet he sees nothing 'face to face,' but only -- to quote the passage
from the Vulgate which was in his mind -- ^per speculum in aenigmate~
['through a glass darkly' -- I Cor. 13.12]. What he has power to see
is the reflection of a reflection from one mirror to another. Nay,
even this is an under-statement. We must remember that this sphere
of Saturn is presided over by the Thrones, the third Order of Angels,
and that Dante expressly calls them 'mirrors,' reflecting the Divine
judgments to all spheres from this downward [^Par.~ IX.61-63]. Hence we
have a succession of mirrors: the mirror of the Thrones sends an image
of the Divine truth into the mirror of Saturn; the mirror of Saturn
reflects it to the mirror of the poet's eyes; and finally, the mirror
of the eyes reflects it to the mind behind the eyes."

	|19-24.~  As Tozer (comm. to these verses) paraphrases: "The man who
could conceive the greatness of my joy in feasting my eyes on
Beatrice's face, would also be able to understand that I felt still
greater delight in obeying her injunctions, when I looked away from her
to the object which she indicated."

	|19.~  It is not unusual for Dante to present his intellectual quest in
terms of metaphors of ingestion.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ X.22-27.

	|24.~  The line "balancing the one side of the scale against the other"
reflects the strength of the protagonist's desire to look at Beatrice
as measured against his even greater desire to obey her.

	|25-27.~  If Saturn is never named in his own heaven, he is clearly
identified in this tercet.  The planet and its homonymous pagan deity
are both referred to here, Saturn proclaimed a beloved monarch under
whom justice, in the form of the Golden Age, thrived.  For a previous
(and similarly circumlocutory) reference to Saturn, see ^Inferno~
XIV.95-96; and, for Dante's overall assessment of this best of the
pagan gods, who presided over a golden age, see Amilcare Iannucci
("Saturn in Dante," in ^Saturn: from Antiquity to the Renaissance~, ed.
M. Ciavolella and A. A. Iannucci [University of Toronto: Dovehouse,
1992], pp. 51-67).

The planet is mentioned by name only once in the poem (^Purg~. XIX.3).
It is a larger presence in ^Convivio~, where it is mentioned several
times, including in the following description: "The heaven of Saturn
has two properties by which it may be compared to Astrology: one is the
slowness of its movement through the 12 signs, for according to the
writings of the astrologers, a time of more than 29 years is required
for its revolution; the other is that it is high above all the other
planets" (^Conv~. II.xiii.28 - tr. R. Lansing).  This makes it
symbolically the most lofty philosophical pursuit of all, since
astrology is the highest and most difficult science for its students to
master.  Theology alone is more lofty - and more difficult.

	|28-30.~  This ladder, as has been recognized at least since the
fourteenth century (see the Codice Cassinese, comm. to ^Par~. XXII.67),
derives from the Bible, the ladder to Heaven seen by Jacob in his dream
(Genesis 28:12), as Dante's reference in the next canto will underline
(^Par~. XXII.70-72).  Further, and as Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 29-30)
point out, both these saints, Peter Damian and Benedict, the latter in
the Rule that he set down for his Order (see Giorgio Varanini ["Canto
XXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan
{Florence: Le Monnier, 1968}, p. 798]) had written of Jacob's Ladder as
emblematizing the purpose of (monastic) life.  However, we probably
ought also to consider Boethius, who presents the Lady Philosophy as
having the image of a ladder on her gown (^Cons. Phil~. I.1[pr]),
connecting the Greek letters ^pi~ (at the bottom, for practical
knowledge) and ^theta~ (at the top, for theoretical or, we might say,
contemplative knowledge [Dante knew enough Greek to realize that
^theta~ is also the first letter of the word for God, ^theos~]).
Singleton (comm. to vv. 29-30) credits Grandgent for the reference to
Boethius.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXII.1.

That the ladder is golden reminds us that Saturn reigned in the golden
age.

	|29.~  See Marco Pecoraro ("Canto XXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], pp.
745-49), for a discussion of this ^scaleo~, which eventually settles on
the traditional interpretation; the ladder, built of rungs of humility,
leads to the contemplation of God.  Pecoraro takes an interesting
detour through the writings of Paolo Amaducci, a neglected figure in
Dante studies, who effectively was the first modern critic (Filippo
Villani was arguably the first ancient one) to apply the fourfold
method of Scriptural exegesis to interpreting Dante (for Amaducci,
without reference to Pecoraro's earlier notice, see Hollander ["Dante
^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante Studies~ 94 {1976}: 128-29, n. 49 and
^Dante: A Life in Works~ {New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001}, p.
187, n. 45]).  (Pecoraro discusses only one of Amaducci's five studies
of Dante's supposed reliance on Peter Damian [^Nel cielo de'
contemplanti: S. Pier Damiano Ravennate; saggio di una interpretazione
nuova della~ Divina commedia {Rome: Alfieri e Lacroix, [1921]}].)
Pecoraro eventually rejects Amaducci's main thesis with regard to Peter
Damian's treatise on the forty-two ^mansiones~ of the Israelites in the
desert (places in which they settled, as recorded in Numbers 33).
Hollander, too, is skeptical about the main theory (involving, among
other things, a forty-two-part ^Commedia~), but does insist that, if
Amaducci were not exactly right (Peter Damian as the specific source
for Dante's typological view of history and his shaping of the
^Commedia~), his work surely merited more attention than it received.
(Amaducci, a historian of Ravenna, had a mid-career "conversion" to
Dante and spent the rest of his life doing work [four monographs and
one ^lectura Dantis~ of ^Par~. XXI] of which at least like-minded
fellow-travelers ought to have been aware.)  When his first book (^La
fonte della~ Divina commedia ^scoperta e descritta da Paolo Amaducci~
[Rovigo: Tipografia Sociale, 1911]) failed to convince many people, he
invested a quarter century (his last publication in this vein was ^La
diretta dipendenza della~ Divina Commedia ^dal "De quadresima et
quadraginta duabus hebraeorum mansionibus" di san Pier Damiano
ravennate~, 4 fascicles [San Marino: Arti Grafiche della Balda,
1934-36]) in trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade Dantists that he was
on to something.  Most of the few reviews he received were brutal (one
dismissed him in a single sentence, to the effect that it were better
not to speak of this book).  But he was on to something important, if
he himself did not properly generalize his discovery.

	|31-33.~  It is eventually clear (e.g., vv. 64-66) that all these
spirits (compared to all the stars in the nighttime sky), descending,
are coming from the Empyrean for the sole purpose of welcoming Dante to
his higher degree of contemplative awareness; that they, like all the
spirits we see in the heavens, are only temporary visitors to these
realms; that all the saved souls and the angels populate the Empyrean
(as far as we can tell, they have never manifested themselves to anyone
in a lower heaven before Dante's most extraordinary visit to the
heavens that concludes his journey through the afterworld).

Jacob saw angels on the ladder in his dream, ascending ^and~
descending.  Dante sees the souls of the blessed only descending, at
least for now.

	|34-42.~  This is the sole "classical" simile in these two cantos
devoted to the monastic sphere of Saturn (but see ^Par~. XXII.1-6) and
perhaps represents the only joyous moment in them.  It describes those
souls who descend from the Empyrean, where such behavior is not only
appropriate but natural, for it is the realm of everlasting joy.

This fairly extended simile is complex enough to have caused
considerable difficulty.  For an interesting and original
interpretation, see Carroll (comm. to these verses).  He argues that
Dante has carefully followed Thomas Aquinas (^ST~ II-II, q. 180, a.
3-6) for every detail of this passage (Torraca [comm. to these verses]
will later cite the same passage without treating it as fully).  Here
is an abbreviated version of Carroll's argument: Thomas is responding
to Richard of St. Victor's six steps of contemplation, reduced by
Richard himself to three: ^Cogitatio~, ^Meditatio~, ^Contemplatio~.
When the descending spirits, the jackdaws in the simile, reach a
certain step, groups of them begin moving in one of three ways (about
which there will be more shortly).  That step, Carroll says, represents
Richard's second step, Meditation, or speculation, an intellectual
activity that draws, in Aquinas's treatment here, on the image of
mirroring (as Carroll points out Dante has done in vv. 17-18).  The
descending spirits, we must remember, are used to seeing in the third
way, Contemplation.  Now, re-entering the protagonist's realm of
experience, which necessarily falls short of seeing face-to-face (as
even he will be able to do shortly, once he enters the Empyrean), these
saved souls behave in three different ways.  Carroll associates each of
these behaviors in turn with Thomas's discussion of Richard of St.
Victor's three modes of intellectual activity: "Some of the souls 'go
away without return,' that is, without doubling back: they represent
the ^straight~ motion which goes direct from things of sense to things
of intellect.  Some 'turn back to where they started from' -- to the
certain step from which their flight began: they represent the
^oblique~ motion, which is composed, says Aquinas, of a mixture of
straight and circular, of reason and divine illumination.  And some,
'wheeling, make a sojourn': they represent the ^circular~ motion, --
that perfect movement by which the intellect turns uniformly round one
centre of Divine truth, the 'sojourn' signifying the immobility of this
motion, as of a revolving wheel that sleeps upon the axle."

Other, later analyses, all apparently without knowledge of Carroll's,
are less convincing.  E.g., Gabriele Muresu ("Lo specchio e la
contemplazione [^Paradiso~ XXI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996], pp. 9-15),
who cites, as source for the discussion (p. 11n.) of Richard's three
modes (which he dismisses), E.G. Gardner (^Dante and the Mystics~
[London: Dent, 1913], pp. 173-74), only thus to deny Carroll's
hypothesis without mentioning its founder, perhaps because he knows it
only indirectly, from Momigliano's gloss to these verses, which
mentions only Gardner and Richard of St. Victor, leaving both Carroll
and St. Thomas out of the discussion.  Carroll's hypothesis, alone
among those heretofore offered, has at least the potential capacity to
deal with this issue.  Zygmunt Baranski ("Canto XXII," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 353-57), like Muresu, refers only
to Richard and Gardner, thus also leaving Thomas and Carroll to one
side.  Baranski also sets off contemplation from its higher
counterpart, mystical vision (rather than Meditation from
Contemplation, as Carroll does).  Christian apologists, however, e.g.,
Thomas, ^In I Sententiarum~ (q. 1, a. 1), tend to link the words
^contemplatio~ and ^Dei~.  And see ^ST~ II-II, q. 180, a. 3, reply to
Objection 1: "But 'contemplation' regards the simple act of gazing on
the truth; wherefore Richard says again (^De Grat. Contempl~. i, 4)
that 'contemplation is the soul's clear and free dwelling upon the
object of its gaze; meditation is the survey of the mind while occupied
in searching for the truth: and cogitation is the mind's glance which
is prone to wander.'"

As for the birds themselves, Carroll cites Benvenuto (comm. to these
verses) to the effect that they love solitude and choose the desert for
their habitation.  ^Pole~, according to some commentators, are
^cornacchie grige~ (gray crows, or jackdaws), having black wings,
silver eyes, and large red beaks encircled by yellow.

For Peter Damian's notice that when Benedict went from Subiaco to
Montecassino the crows he had befriended followed him there, see Marco
Pecoraro ("Canto XXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir.
M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 752); G,untert ("Canto
XXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 333).

	|34.~  For ^costume~ as "natural instinct" or "inner law," see the note
at its first appearance in the poem, where it also seems to have this
sense (^Inf~. III.73).

	|37-39.~  It is perhaps needless to say that there have been several
ingenious attempts to explain these three movements of the birds.  It
is perhaps fair to say that none has seemed ultimately convincing.
Carroll's, based in the texts of Richard of St. Victor and of Aquinas
(see the note to vv. 34-42), remains the most interesting.

	|42.~  It may be fair to suggest that the significance of this "rung"
of Jacob's Ladder has also escaped even the few who choose to discuss
it.  It seems unlikely to represent a mere "realistic" detail, for
example, the "rung" of the "ladder" that is at a level with the heaven
of Saturn.  Again, see Carroll's interesting hypothesis (see the note
to vv. 34-42), that this is the "grade" of meditation, the earthly form
of divine contemplation, as it were.  In other words, Peter has
momentarily desisted from his contemplation of God to minister to Dante.

	|43.~  This soul will eventually identify himself as Peter Damian at
verse 121.  See the note to vv. 106-126.

	|46-48.~  Dante underlines his obedience to Beatrice as the reason he
does not respond more fully to Peter Damian's affection for this
special visitor to the sphere of Saturn.  This tercet casts her in the
role of leader of a monastic community, setting the rules for
conversation and all other aspects of the social life of the "monk"
under her care, Dante Alighieri.

	|49-50.~  Once again we are given to understand that the souls in bliss
are able to know all that may be known in their contemplation of the
mind of God, the mirror of all creation.  The identical nature of such
knowledge with its source is suggested by the three uses of the verb
^vedere~ in these two lines.

	|51.~  Beatrice only now releases Dante to open his mind and heart to
Peter.

	|52-60.~  From Peter, Dante wants to know two things: why he seemed, by
his proximity, so affectionate toward him and why, for the first time
in the heavens, song has yielded to silence.

	|58-60.~  Saturn is marked by an atmosphere of monastic self-denial.
It is the home of the cardinal virtue temperance and of religious
meditation.  The absence of melody in Saturn is singular thus far in
^Paradiso~, for we and the protagonist have become accustomed to
hearing sacred songs as we ascend the spheres: ^Ave Maria~ in the Moon
(^Par~. III.121-122); an ^Osanna~ in both Mercury (VII.1) and Venus
(VIII.29); the singing of the souls in the Sun is referred to a good
half dozen times (^Par~. X.66, X.76, X.146; XII.6, XII.23; XIV.24), but
it is only in ^Paradiso~ XIII.25-27 that we are informed that they
sing, not of Bacchus nor of Apollo, but of the Trinity; next we learn
that the unidentified song in Mars contains the words ^Risurgi~ and
^Vinci~ (^Par~. XIV.125) and that the souls in Jupiter sing of God
(^Par~. XVIII.99).  Underscoring the uniqueness of the silence of this
sphere, the final three heavens are also marked by song: the Starry
Sphere by Gabriel's song for Mary (^Par~. XXIII.103-108) and by the
other members of the Church Triumphant crying out, to the ascending
mother of God, ^Regina celi~ (^Par~. XXIII.128).  In the succeeding
sphere, various moments in Dante's progress among his saintly
interlocutors are punctuated by voices raised in song: ^Dio laudamo~
(^Par~. XXIV.113), ^Sperino in te~ (^Par~. XXV.73), ^Sperent in te~
(^Par~. XXV.98), ^Santo, santo, santo~ (^Par~. XXVI.69), ^Al Padre, al
Figlio, a lo Spirito Santo, gloria~ (^Par~. XXVII.1-2); in the
Crystalline Sphere the angelic choirs resonate with "Hosannah" (^Par~.
XXVIII.94); in the Empyrean we hear once more the ^Ave Maria~ (^Par~.
XXXII.95).  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVII.1-3.

	|59.~  The adjective ^dolce~ (sweet) occurs with some regularity from
one end of the poem (^Inf~. I.43) to the other (^Par~. XXXIII.63), 106
times in all, occurring 19 times in the first ^cantica~, 44 in the
second, and 43 in ^Paradiso~.

	|61-63.~  Peter Damian gives his answer to the second of Dante's
questions first.  It is brutally frank: Dante still thinks as the world
thinks and is not yet ready to experience the higher degree of divinity
that songs at this level represent.  And now we also learn that this
was precisely the reason for Beatrice's withholding of her customary
smile as well (see verse 4).

	|64-72.~  Peter's answer to Dante's first question is more circuitous,
but reflects the same problem: Dante's inability to think beyond the
limits of a human comprehension of love.  Peter's affection for Dante
is not greater than that felt by any others among the saved in
Paradise, that is to say, it is not "personal."  We may remember
Casella, in ^Purgatorio~ II, whose greeting was very personal indeed,
as a kind of control for our measurement of this affection.

	|73-78.~  Still a slow learner, Dante gets part of the message: In the
Court of Heaven, freedom in loving is to follow God's will, a similar
paradox to that developed in Beatrice's lengthy discussion of free will
in ^Paradiso~ V.19-33.  On the other hand, his follow-up question
reveals that he is still eager to understand the ^reason~ for the
choice of Peter Damian as the deliverer of heavenly greeting.

	|77.~  For Aquinas's distinction (^ST~ I, q. 23, a. 1) between
providence and predestination, see Torraca (comm. to these verses).
Carroll, in another context (comm. to ^Par~. XX.130-132), cites this
same passage in the ^Summa~ and paraphrases it as follows: "Hence
Predestination is defined as 'Divine Providence leading rational
creatures to their supernatural end, the Beatific Vision,' the entire
process, from beginning to end, having its reason in the Divine will
alone.  It is not dependent on the foreseen merits of the elect; and
the prayers of saints (such as Gregory's for Trajan) are only part of
the second causes by means of which the decree of Predestination is
worked out."  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 78) also cite Thomas (^ST~
I, q. 22, a. 3): "Two things belong to providence -- namely, the type
of the order of things foreordained towards an end; and the execution
of this order, which is called government."  They go on to suggest that
Dante was in accord with this view in ^Paradiso~ XI.28-30.  Their point
is that the subject here is not predestination, but divine
foreknowledge of the actions of particular individuals.

For more on predestination, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XX.130-148.

	|83-90.~  Peter's preamble tells Dante how he was filled with divine
love for his mission, but ^not~ why, as his final point will insist.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) paraphrase the passage as follows:
"The light of grace descends on me, penetrating the light that wraps me
round, in whose womb I am enclosed, and its power, conjoined with my
intellect, lifts me so far above myself that I can see the supreme
essence, God, from whom this light bursts forth.  From this sight comes
the joy with which I shine, since the splendor of my flame is as great
as the clarity of my vision of God."

	|84.~  Gabriele Muresu ("Lo specchio e la contemplazione [^Paradiso~
XXI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996], p. 30) reports discomfort at the Dantean
coinage ^inventrarsi~ on the part of several commentators.  Among those
he mentions are Tommaseo (comm. to this verse): ^"non bello"~ (not
beautiful) is his laconic reaction.  Andreoli (comm. to this verse) has
this to say: The term is "unfit to describe a heavenly spirit speaking
of his divine light."  But see Mattalia (comm. to this verse) for an
understanding of Dante's sense of the Scriptural relevance of the word,
reflecting the Gospels' references to Mary's womb (e.g., Luke 11:27,
cited by Virgil, as character, at ^Inf~. VIII.45).  As usual,
Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) has a lengthy discussion of the
variant readings.  See also the two appearances of the noun ^ventre~
(womb, belly) in this ^cantica~ (^Par~. XXIII.104 and ^Par~. XXXIII.7
and the notes thereto).

	|90.~  For the word ^pareggio~, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXIII.67.

	|91-102.~  Not even the most exalted soul in Heaven, Peter explains,
possibly referring to Mary (see ^Par~. XXXI.116-117), nor the most
enlightened of the Seraphim, the highest order of angels, can ever know
the reasons for God's decisions.  Thus even angelic intelligence has a
limit.  All those in the Empyrean can know, in God, all relations among
all things, in heaven and on earth, but not the eventual reasons that
might explain their causes.  The urgency of Peter's explanation to
Dante is clearly aimed past him, to us on earth, who so enjoy imagining
that we understand the root causes of events even though our normal
sinful disability should probably deprive us of such baseless optimism
in this regard.  But we are little more mature than babies, forever
asking "Why?"  See, on this passage, Peter Hawkins ("^Paradiso~ XVIII,"
in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~
ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], p. 313).

	|94-95.~  The description of providence (God's foreknowledge, which
alone can account for the causes that lie behind the interrelations of
things) as an "abyss" suggests a "plurality of worlds," this universe
(known by the angels and the blessed) and the vast inner mind of God
that extends (if it may be said to extend) to regions of which we
cannot possess even the slightest knowledge nor indeed verify the
existence.  At least as early as ^Purgatorio~ III.37, Dante should have
understood that such things were beyond knowing.  Virgil then advised
him that humans were not behaving rationally when they hoped to know
the "why" behind things.  Dante is, as we are frequently forced to
acknowledge, a slow learner.

	|103-105.~  Discouraged from pursuing his quest for knowledge beyond
both human and, indeed, angelic potential, Dante contents himself with
asking Peter, in the form of his third question, to identify himself.

	|106-126.~  The seven tercets dedicated to the life of Peter Damian
(1007-1072) are reminiscent of the earlier saints' lives that we have
heard in ^Paradiso~.  Once again we begin with a geographical indicator
(the mountain called Catria, in the Apennines, that rises some five
thousand feet above sea level, near the town of Gubbio).  Peter's
narrative is brief and self-abnegating (those of Francis [^Par~. XI]
and of Dominic [^Par~. XII] are considerably more full, but then they
are narrated by praiseful others, not by their abstemious selves).
Peter's is modesty itself, concluding with the ironic and bitter
reflection on his having been made to give over the life of prayer that
truly pleased him for that of "administration."

"St. Peter Damian, proclaimed doctor of the Church by Leo XII in 1828;
born of an obscure family at Ravenna ^c.~ 1007.  In his childhood he
was much neglected, and after the death of his parents was set by his
eldest brother to tend swine.  Later on, another brother, named Damian,
who was archdeacon of Ravenna, took compassion on him and had him
educated.  Peter in gratitude assumed his brother's name and was
thenceforth known as Peter Damian (Petrus Damiani).  After studying at
Ravenna, Faenza, and Parma, he himself became a teacher, and soon
acquired celebrity.  At the age of about 28, however, he entered the
Benedictine monastery of Fonte Avellana on the slopes of Monte Catria,
of which in 1043 he became abbot.  In this capacity he rendered
important services to Popes Gregory VI, Clement II, Leo IX, Victor II,
and Stephen IX, by the last of whom he was in 1057, much against his
will, created cardinal bishop of Ostia.  He appears to have been a
zealous supporter of these popes, and of Hildebrand (afterwards Gregory
VII), in their efforts to reform Church discipline, and made journeys
into France and Germany with that object.  After fulfilling several
important missions under Nicholas II and Alexander II, he died at an
advanced age at Faenza, Feb. 22, 1072.

"Dante represents Peter Damian as inveighing against the luxury of the
prelates in his day; the commentators quote in illustration a passage
from a letter of his to his brother cardinals, in which he reminds them
that the dignity of a prelate does not consist in wearing rare and
costly furs and fine robes, nor in being escorted by troops of armed
adherents, nor in riding on neighing and mettlesome steeds, but in the
practice of morality and the exercise of the saintly virtues" (Toynbee,
"Damiano, Pietro" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  While he was never
formally canonized, he was venerated as a saint from the time following
his death in several places in Italy and at Cluny.

For possible points of contact between this part of the poem and Peter
Damian's own writings as well as twenty or so of the legends that
accumulated around his life, see Vittorio Capetti ("Dante e le leggende
di S. Pier Damiano," Appendix to his ^Studi sul "Paradiso" dantesco~
[Bologna: Zanichelli, 1906], pp. 111-30).

	|111.~  John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 106-111) distinguishes among
^latr@ia~ (the accent in the poem may be due to the requirements of
rhyme or, as Scartazzini suggests [comm. to this verse], to Dante's
small Greek), ^dulia~, and ^yperdulia~.  The first is defined as
honoring God alone; the second, those who are virtuous (e.g., the
saints); the third, "things excellent" (examples are Mary and the
cross).  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 109-111) mentions the appearance of the
term in both Augustine (^DcD~ X.1) and Aquinas (^ST~ II-II, q. 81, a.
1).  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 106-111) was the first to
cite Isidore of Seville for the term (^Etym~. VIII.xi.11).

	|115-117.~  This tercet contains one (of two) references in the heaven
of Saturn to "contemplative" intellectual behavior or to those who
perform it (see also the word ^contemplanti~ in ^Par~. XXII.46).  In
neither case does it seem to refer to ^contemplatio Dei~, but would
rather seem to indicate monastic rumination, or meditation, thoughts
that lead to God, but not a direct vision of Him.  In fact, of the
seven uses of words derived from ^contemplare~ in the poem, beginning
in ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.132, where Virgil, Dante, and Statius meditate
upon Gluttony, only one would clearly seem to indicate contemplation of
the highest kind, St. Bernard in ^Paradiso~ XXXI.111; but even that may
have been contemplation of the Virgin (as his contemplation referred to
in ^Par~. XXXII.1 clearly is).  For the two other occurrences, see
^Par~. XXVIII.131 and ^Par~. XXIX.68; and see the note to ^Par~.
XXI.34-42.

	|121-123.~  There has been controversy over the reference of the second
Peter in this tercet.  Petrocchi's text has "fu'" (^fui~ [I was]).  And
the logic of the phrasing also indicates a single reference: In place
1, I was called "x," in place 2, "y."  Later historical certainty,
which would make Dante responsible for knowing that there was another
Peter, a monk in the monastery to which he has Pietro allude and who
died there in 1119, may not apply.  Scholars have pointed out that
Dante's knowledge of Peter Damian was itself suspect; he could easily
have conflated these two religious of Ravenna in this passage written,
one assumes, after his settling in Ravenna ca. 1317.  However, since
Peter Damian died in 1072, nearly fifty years before the death of
Pietro Peccatore, Dante's phrasing would seem quite odd: "In that place
(his monastery at Fonte Avellana) I was known as Peter Damian, and
Peter the Sinner was (^fu~, not ^fu'~, abbreviation of ^fui~) in the
House of Our Lady...."  The syntax and logic seem beyond rescue.  The
first version may be historically inaccurate, but it does make
grammatical sense: "In that place I was (^fu'~, not ^fu~) known as
Peter Damian, and as Peter the Sinner in the House of Our Lady."  This
view is in accord with the generally authoritative Michele Barbi (^Con
Dante e coi suoi interpreti~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1941], pp. 257-96)
and with the later discussion in Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi
(^Paradiso, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1997]),
pp. 596-97 - with updated bibliography).

For a review of the history of the issue (and eventual agreement with
Barbi's analysis), see Marco Pecoraro ("Canto XXI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
pp. 771-77).  For strong support of Barbi's views on the single
identity of the two Peters, see Gabriele Muresu ("Lo specchio e la
contemplazione [^Paradiso~ XXI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996], p. 35n.).
That Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 121-123), who knew that part of
Italy well, spoke so forcefully about the "deception" of those who
believe that Dante is talking about two Peters probably should have
concluded the debate long ago.

	|125.~  Like Shakespeare's "hats and clocks" in ^Julius Caesar~ (II.i),
Peter's "cappello," the red hat worn by cardinals, is a gratuitous
anachronism on Dante's part.  As Torraca was the first commentator to
point out (comm. to vv. 124-126, citing an article in ^BSDI~ 6 [1899]),
it was only during the papacy (1243-54) of Innocent IV that this
clerical accouterment began to be worn by the princes of the Church.

	|127-135.~  Peter concludes his words to Dante with a denunciation of
corrupt clergy, culminating in one of the more memorable anticlerical
images in the poem, the pastor on horseback as beast with attendants,
his poor horse sagging under the weight of his flesh and gorgeous robes.

Dante may have known Peter's own imprecations against the corruptions
of the clergy in his ^Liber Gomorrhianus~ (as was often suggested in
the last century, first by Torraca [comm. to vv. 121-123]).  As a
number of commentators suggest, Peter was a man after Dante's heart,
not only for his surprising openness to "imperial" politics, but
especially for his scurrilous tongue for the malfeasance of the clergy,
for which he apologizes but apparently delights in allowing free rein.
That Dante was recognized as anticlerical by the clergy is not a matter
to doubt.  There is the obvious case of the ^Monarchia~ (which spent
some three centuries and one-third [from the first index of prohibited
books until 1881] as unfit for Catholic eyes).   However, and as
Adriano Comollo (^Il dissenso religioso in Dante~ [Florence: Olschki,
1990], pp. 49-50) points out, there were any number of rough spots, for
a cleric respectful of his pope, in the poem as well (particularly
^Inf~. XI.6-9; XIX.106-117; ^Purg~. XIX.106-116; and ^Par~. IX.136-142).

	|127-128.~  Cephas (stone [^pietra~]) is the [Aramaic] name that Christ
gave to Simon (see John 1:42), thereafter known as Simon Peter (Pietro,
in Italian, keeps the pun alive better than does the English "Peter").
The "exalted vessel of the Holy Ghost" is Paul (see ^Inf~. II.28).

	|129.~  Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) points to biblical sources
for this fraternal abnegation: I Corinthians 10:27 ("eat whatever is
set before you") and Luke 10:7 (Christ advising his disciples not to go
from house to house in search of food, but to stay wherever they chance
to be).

	|136-142.~  Peter's collegial souls, as they descend the ladder to
greet him, glow with righteous indignation at these words.  Surrounding
him, having ceased their circular movement, they let loose a cry so
loud and angry that Dante cannot make out the words of what they shout.
 Where earlier in the canto he had been denied both Beatrice's smile
and the singing of the blessed, now he is allowed to hear a superfluity
of sound with a similar net result.  (The canto moves from monastic
silence to monkish outrage, each of them leaving the protagonist
stunned, uncomprehending.)  It is a final reminder of his human
incapacity even now, when he has attained the height of Saturn in the
heavens.

For this "thunder" as resonating with that found in Ovid's description
of Jupiter, preparing to descend to seduce Semele by taking his thunder
and his lightning bolts along (^Metam~. III.300), see Kevin Brownlee
("Ovid's Semele and Dante's Metamorphosis: ^Paradiso~ 21-22," in Rachel
Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil
and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press,
1991], pp. 226-27).
