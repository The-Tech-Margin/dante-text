	|1-9.~  A simile, with the formal markers of the trope suppressed
(e.g., "just as," "so," "like") but with reference to its literary kind
embedded in it (^similitudine~ [a hapax, verse 7]), this comparison of
the sounds of Thomas's voice, at the circumference of the smaller
circle of saints, and of Beatrice's, issuing from near Dante at the
center of that circle, draws attention to the mind of its maker, a
witness of such celestial phenomena.  The meaning is clear enough, if
some have stumbled over the question of how water in the center of a
bowl may be struck (answer: by something falling from above [like the
thought that drops into Dante's mind -- see the last part of the note
to vv. 7-9]).

For the frequency of figurative language in ^Paradiso~, see Luigi
Vanossi ("Figure iconiche del ^Paradiso~," in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco
Folena~, ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma,
1993], pp. 447-62).

	|4.~  The Latinism ^caso~, for "fall," is used uniquely here
(ordinarily in the ^Commedia~ the word means either "chance" or
"instance" [see ^Inf~. IV.136, ^Inf~. XXV.41, ^Purg~. X.66]).

	|6.~  The use of the word "vita" to designate the soul of Thomas echoes
^Paradiso~ XII.127, describing the living soul ^(vita)~ of Bonaventure.
 See the note to ^Paradiso~ IX.7.

	|7-9.~  Just as the previous canto, in order to introduce a new group
of saved souls, had begun with two instantaneously coupled links in a
chain of events, the first of which is Thomas's speaking his concluding
word (^Par~. XI.139 and XII.1-3), so now does this one.  The utterance
of Beatrice here comes hard upon Thomas's last word.  It is probably
not accidental that the Latinism ^caso~ in verse 4 reflects that
particular word, ^cadere~.  Thomas says "fall" and it "falls" into
Dante's mind that the discourse of Thomas and Beatrice are similar.
That similarity is assumed to be obvious by most of the commentators,
who, at any rate, do not trouble to discuss it.  However, it is not
finally clear what is meant.  Thomas has just finished a longish
discourse (^Par~. XIII.112-142) about the limited capacity of human
knowledge.  Beatrice's nine verses insist on the same thing: she knows
what Dante wants to know even before he does.  What these two saved
souls share intellectually is the ability common to those who dwell in
the Empyrean to know all that is knowable, and to know it in God
(including, clearly, as the next tercet demonstrates, the future
thoughts of mortals before they think them).

Dante apparently uses traditional narrative sequencing to present these
nearly simultaneous experiences.  However, upon examination, things are
not quite as "orderly" as they seem.  We can attempt to establish the
timeline for the opening of the canto:

(1)	1-3.  Dante's perception of what has happened, expressed in an
image of movement directed inward from the circumference of a circle
and of movement directed outward from its center.

(2)	4-6.  This fell into his mind after Thomas finished speaking
(^Par~. XIII.142), a moment that occurred between cantos, as it were.

(3)	7-9.  Beatrice spoke immediately upon Thomas's cessation of speech.
Thus, the building blocks of the narrative process are not 1-2-3 but
more like 2/3 (nearly simultaneous) and, only then, 1.  For a
consideration of a related problem, the representation of sequence and
of simultaneity in this heaven, see Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1992], pp. 194-216).

	|10-18.~  These are Beatrice's first words since ^Paradiso~ X.52-54
(her longest silence since she entered the poem in ^Purgatorio~ XXX;
she will not speak again until ^Par~. XVII.7, and then only briefly),
just before Thomas began speaking at ^Paradiso~ X.82.  Thomas and
Cacciaguida are two of the most voluble characters Dante meets in the
afterlife.  While they speak less than do the most present and
loquacious of the guides, Virgil and Beatrice, not even the more mobile
Statius or the presiding figure in the Empyrean, St. Bernard, speaks as
much as either of these within their respective heavens.  They are
allowed to push Beatrice to the periphery of the discourse.

Dante, Beatrice says, will want to know two related things.  She is
addressing her request to all the saints in both the circles (all her
pronouns are plural; we shall see that she is addressing all
twenty-four of them by the plural ^cerchi~ [circles] of verse 23).  One
of them will step forward to deal with Dante's questions; if we expect
Thomas -- we would be excused if we did -- we will be surprised.

The questions she attributes to Dante are: (1) Will the light that you
give off be yours in eternity?  (2) If it will, how will you not be
blinded by one another once you get your bodies back [and become all
the more resplendent]?

	|19-24.~  As opposed to the first simile in the canto (see the note to
vv.1-9), this one is fully expressed in the conventional mode, both
tenor and vehicle keyed by the expected terms of comparison
^(Come...cos@i)~.  As circling dancers here on earth sometimes show
greater pleasure by moving more animatedly and singing, so these
twenty-four souls revealed (by moving more animatedly and singing) that
they were pleased by Beatrice's request (they obviously take delight in
being able to make others feel more joy).

	|25-27.~  Contemporary readers, who think of rain only as an inhibitor
of outdoor relaxation or of light chores on a summer's day, will not
see the point in this exaltation of a cooling shower in the sweltering
Tuscan (un-air-conditioned) summertime.  For the opposite sort of rain,
see ^Inferno~ VI.7-12.

	|28-29.~  Lombardi (comm. to vv. 28-32) points out that none of the
earlier commentators had revealed the plan in the first two lines,
which is to set the "one" of the first verse against the "three" of the
second, and the "three" of the first against the "one" of the second,
thus making dramatic the relations of the Trinity, one-in-three as well
as three-in-one.  He also discusses the significance of the parallel
relation between the two "two"s in the lines, representing the human
and divine united in the Second Person of the Trinity.  Porena (comm.
to these verses) summarizes what is presented here succinctly:
"Theological designation of God, who lives and reigns eternally as a
single Substance, two Natures, and three Persons."

It took a bit longer until the palindromatic structure of these verses
was understood as reflecting Joachim of Flora's structure of history,
with its three great Ages: the first, of the Father; the second, of the
Son; the third, of the Spirit.  See the note to vv. 67-78.  And see one
of the "additional drawings" in the ^Liber figurarum~ (Marjorie Reeves
and Beatrice Hirsch-Reich, ^The "Figurae" of Joachim of Fiore~ [Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1972]) for the three overlapping circles representing
the three Ages.  See also Peter Dronke ("'Orizzonte che rischiari,'" in
his ^Dante and Medieval Latin Traditions~ [Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1986 {1975}], pp. 7-9).

Longfellow points out (comm. to verse 28) that this tercet is imitated
by Geoffrey Chaucer in the last stanza of his ^Troilus and Criseyde~.

Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 2005], p. 27 and n. 34 [p. 199]) points out that
there was current amongst medieval theologians (followed by some
Dantists today) the notion that the Trinity was in a place apart from
(and higher than) the Empyrean.  It was known as the ^coelum
Trinitatis~ (the heaven of the Trinity) and in it God in His three
persons lived apart from manifestations of His creation.  Moevs is
doubtless correct in asserting that Dante simply combined these two
heavens in his Empyrean.

	|30.~  Cf. ^Purgatorio~ XI.1-2: "Our Father, who are in Heaven, /
circumscribed only by the greater love...."

	|31-32.~  This hymn to the Trinity, like that which it celebrates,
blends multiplicity and unity, in this case twenty-four voices heard as
one.

	|33.~  The Latinism ^muno~ (from the noun ^munus~), a hapax in the poem
clearly forced by rhyme, means "gift, reward."  The reader may choose
to honor (or not) the Ottimo's apparent acceptance of the claim (comm.
to ^Inf~. X.85-87) that he says Dante once made to him: Not only did
rhyme never force him to saying other than he intended to say, but he
was able to make words in the rhyme position mean other than what they
had meant in the work of previous poets.

See the note to ^Paradiso~ I.13-15 for the use of ^munus~ in the
^Epistle to Cangrande~.

	|34-36.~  From the earliest commentators on, e.g., Jacopo della Lana
(comm. to verse 34), writers have identified this unnamed figure as
Solomon.  In light of ^Paradiso~ X.109, which says that his light was
the most beautiful in his circle, it is difficult not to.  However,
Francesco da Buti is the first commentator to hesitate to the point of
not naming any one of the twelve in the first circle; perhaps his
hesitation, shared by several, as we shall see, accounts for some of
the continuing doubt about the identity of this singer.  Landino (comm.
to this tercet) advocates the candidacy of Peter Lombard; we find
Vellutello (comm to vv. 34-39) denying that this is he, and joining
those who believe it is Solomon.  Both Gabriele (comm. to verse 34) and
his pupil, Daniello (comm. to this tercet) abstain.  In more modern
times a similar profile describes the debate, with almost all thinking
it is Solomon to whom reference is made.  However, Porena's uneasiness
is perhaps instructive (comm. to vv. 34-35).  He suggests that Solomon
may be here only because he was seen as the brightest star in his
circle in ^Paradiso~ X (one would like to ask Porena why Dante has so
described him if he did not mean anything by the remark).  He goes on
to wonder why Solomon is never mentioned by name -- a worthy question.
It is also clear that he is a bit concerned by the fleshly activities
and celebrations of the king.  Marguerite Chiarenza ("Solomon's Song in
the ^Divine Comedy~," in ^Sparks and Seeds: Medieval Literature and Its
Afterlife [Essays in Honor of John Freccero]~, ed. Dana E. Stewart and
Alison Cornish [Turnhout: Brepols, 2000], p. 206), on the other hand,
insists on Solomon's value, in Dante's eyes, for his heightened sense
of the importance of the flesh.  She also notes that Dante's practice
of not naming him, but always (^Purg~. XXX.10, ^Par~. X.109, and here)
presenting him as a privileged member of a group (pp. 206-7), thus
examining the same phenomenon that makes Porena feel that Dante is
uncomfortable with his own treatment of Solomon.  Chiarenza sees, much
more steadily, that he is playing off ^our~ discomfort.  (For an
example of that discomfort, see Carroll's remarks in the note to
^Paradiso~ XIII.97-102.)

It seems clear that this is indeed Solomon, and that Dante values him
very highly, ranking him even higher than Thomas, both in the
description of his brightness in Canto X and in choosing him to hold
the last and privileged position in the heaven of the Sun.  If we
reflect how surely we expect Thomas to answer Beatrice's formulations
of Dante's doubts (let the reader start reading again at Canto X and
come to this canto innocent of both knowledge and inclination: Will not
he or she expect Thomas to take command once more?), we can recapture
some of our original surprise at finding not Thomas but Solomon here.
And, as Scartazzini (comm. to verse 34) reminds us (Carroll [comm. to
vv. 34-60] allows the same point), a passage in Ecclesiastes (3:18-22)
reveals Solomon's skepticism about the destination of the soul after
the death of the body.  Carroll's treatment, unlike Scartazzini's, goes
on to argue that an expert of no less authority than Aquinas asserts
(^ST~ I, q. 75, a. 6) that in this passage Solomon is speaking "in the
character of the foolish" about an error of others that he states in
order to refute.  Whether Scartazzini or Carroll is right, it does seem
that Dante knows that, even in asserting that Solomon was saved, he was
taking on some pretty estimable adversaries (e.g, Augustine); in making
him an authority on the Trinity and the General Resurrection, he has,
once again, chosen to live dangerously.

	|34.~  The adjective ^dia~ can mean (and it has had both meanings in
the poem) "divine" or "shining."  We have followed Bosco/Reggio (comm.
to vv. 34-35) and many others in believing that here it possesses the
latter meaning.

	|35.~  The word ^modesta~ sent Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 34-36) in a
direction Erich Auerbach would explore more amply in his essay "^Sermo
humilis~" (in his ^Literary Language and Its Public in Late Latin
Antiquity and in the Middle Ages~, tr. R. Manheim [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1965 {1958}], pp. 25-66).  Tommaseo hears the voice
of Beatrice beneath this verse.  See ^Inferno~ II.56-57, where she is
reported by Virgil to have spoken to him on her visit to Limbo "soave e
piana, / con angelica voce, in sua favella" (gentle and clear... -- /
an angel's voice was in her speech).  And see the note to ^Inferno~
II.56-57.  See also Paola Nasti ("The Wise Poet: Solomon in Dante's
Heaven of the Sun," ^Reading Medieval Studies~ 27 [2001]: 120).

	|36.~  The reference to Gabriel and the Annunciation is a brief,
iconographic way to connect this passage to the Song of Solomon, the
wedding song of Christ and his Bride (the Church), as it was
interpreted by generations of Christian exegetes.

	|37-60.~  Solomon's hymn, so different in technique from Thomas's
"Scholastic" verses in these cantos, really does seem intended to
imitate the warmth and poetic quality of the Canticle of Canticles.  He
answers Dante's two questions (vv. 37-57: in the rest of time the saved
shall shine as brightly as we do here and now, until, after the General
Resurrection, the renewed presence of our bodies will make us shine
more brightly still; vv. 58-60: indeed, our restored senses, stronger
than they are now, will be capable of looking on this even greater
brightness).  However, he does so by singing what can only be regarded
as a hymn to the General Resurrection, to borrow from Momigliano (comm.
to vv. 28-33), a passage of critical prose that captures, as well
perhaps as any has ever done, the thread uniting this entire canto, a
celebration that combines praise of the Trinity and of the
Resurrection.  In an only human view, these two moments are registered
as the birth and death of Jesus.

Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della
"Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], pp. 226-28) characterizes
these lines as a spectacular case of Dante's "circolarit@a ritmica e
concettuale" (rhythmic and conceptual circularity).

	|37-39.~  Solomon responds to Beatrice's question on Dante's behalf of
all the spirits gathered in the Sun (see vv. 13-15), the answer to
which is "we shall be resplendent eternally."

	|40-51.~  For a discussion of previous notice (that of Umberto Bosco
and of Patrick Boyde) of the way in which this passage is complementary
to ^Inferno~ VI.106-111, where Virgil tells Dante that after the Last
Judgment and the recovery of their bodies, the sinners will feel more
pain, see Manuele Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame:
Notre Dame University Press, 2005], pp. 154-57).  Solomon's words
clearly state that the reclad soul will have greater powers of sight,
and thus, it would follow, greater joy in seeing both the "soldiery of
Paradise" and God Himself.

For interesting and pertinent remarks about the rhetorical figure
^chiasmus~ in this canto, beginning with its first verse and
culminating in Solomon's speech, in these twelve verses, see Madison
Sowell ("^Paradiso~ XIV," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
{virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], pp. 201-5).  This trope derives its name from the
Greek character transliterated as ^chi~ and expressed as "X"; thus,
like the two major elements in the letter "x" (\> \<), a mirror image,
e.g. "apple baby castle ... castle baby apple."  Depending on its
context, it may also put the reader in mind of the chiasmus-shaped
cross of Christ, as well as of the first letter of His name.

	|40-42.~  In the first of two "interlaced" tercets, Solomon, like
Gabriel in verse 35, is modest, more modest than reading him might
prepare us to find.  The more grace he and his fellow saints
experience, the better they see God; the better they see Him, the more
they love Him; the more they love Him, the brighter they will shine.
The verses run back down the chain of cause and effect.  Cf. the tercet
at vv. 49-51 for a second example of this sort of interlacing.  There
the order is natural, i.e., we move from seeing to loving to shining.

	|49-51.~  See the note to vv. 40-42.

	|52-57.~  In marked contrast to Thomas, who only rarely sounds "poetic"
(but see the note to ^Par~. XI.19-21), Solomon here is granted one of
the few similes allowed a speaker in the poem (we have not encountered
a simile since the one involving Iris in ^Par~. XII.10-21).  This
further identifies him with Dante and the world of poetry, eclipsing
Thomas at least a little.  This is not to say that Dante does not value
Thomas; he values hardly anyone more.  But it is also time for some
good-natured revenge on the man who labored to belittle poetry and
poets.

There are some 628 verses in the heaven of the Sun, nearly half of them
(287) spoken by Thomas, poetry's confirmed enemy.  Further, Dante is
silent in all of this heaven, as though to match Thomas by opposition,
switching roles with him.  This is the only "zone" of the entire poem
in which the protagonist does not say a single word.

	|58-60.~  Solomon concludes by responding to Beatrice's representation
of Dante's second question (see vv. 16-18).  The glorified body will
not be too strongly bright for the eyes of the saved, perhaps because
their own resurrected bodies will possess capacities their earthly ones
did not, in this case superhuman eyesight.  Dante's question was based
solely on a normal human understanding of immortality, i.e., on
ignorance.

	|61-66.~  The twenty-four souls in the first two circles, moved by
Solomon's words, show their desire to put on their resurrected flesh,
and perhaps for the same result for all those other saved souls whom
they love.


The reader who believes that Dante is not sympathetic to our physical
selves will have to acknowledge that this passage establishes his
credibility as a human being who, like Solomon, accepts the fact of our
corporeal existence and finds it good.  For Dante's view of the
resurrected body, see Rachel Jacoff ("'Our Bodies, Our Selves': The
Body in the ^Commedia~," in ^Sparks and Seeds: Medieval Literature and
Its Afterlife [Essays in Honor of John Freccero]~, ed. Dana E. Stewart
and Alison Cornish [Turnhout: Brepols, 2000], pp. 119-37).  See also
Caroline Walker Bynum (^The Resurrection of the Body in Western
Christianity 200-1336~ [New York: Columbia University Press, 1995], pp.
291-305).  And see Picone ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 212-13, n. 21) for bibliography of some European
contributions on this subject.  More recently Wei Wei Yeo has
contributed an essay ("Embodiment in the ^Commedia~: Dante's Exilic and
Poetic Self-Consciousness," ^Dante Studies~ 121 [2003 {2006}]: 67-93)
in which she reflects upon recent work on the increasingly popular
question of "the body in Dante."  One has a certain sense that she and
some of her precursors do not understand that the importance of the
body in this poem is in part a natural concomitance of its
self-presentation as history (rather than as fable).  This is not to
suggest that it fails to be an important concern for Dante (nothing
could be farther from the truth), but that some of its presence is
driven by still more pressing concerns.  Had Dante remained in the
allegorical mode of the first three treatises of ^Convivio~, there
would have been little or no such attention in the resultant work.
Such a perception, mirroring the importance of an incarnational poetic
in both ^Vita nuova~ and ^Commedia~, is a central position advanced by
Erich Auerbach from his first pages dedicated to Dante (in his ^Dante,
Poet of the Secular World~ [^Dante, Poet of the Secular World~, tr. R.
Manheim {Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 [1929]}]) through
his last (^"Sermo humilis,"~ in his ^Literary Language and Its Public
in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages~, tr. R. Manheim
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965 {1958}], pp. 25-66).  Yeo,
whose bibliographical recognition of important predecessors is not
ungenerous, does not mention Auerbach's work.

	|62.~  The Hebrew word "amen" is given here in its Tuscan form, ^amme~,
as part of Dante's program of expressing sacred truth in the low
vernacular.  See the note to verse 64.

	|64.~  The use of the word ^mamme~, although forced by rhyme, is
nonetheless striking.  Such usage of the low-vernacular "mommy" is at
one with the context, a soft-hued family portrait of saved humanity, as
it were.  Our translation deploys the less disturbing "mothers" because
of its pairing with ^padri~ (rather than ^babbi~, "daddies").  See the
notes to ^Inferno~ XXXII.1-9 and ^Purgatorio~ XXI.97-99.

	|67-78.~  This supercharged passage has begun to be understood only in
the past one hundred and one years.  An undergraduate student, Randy
Mamiaro (Princeton '80), caused a stir in class when (in December 1979)
he suggested that this third circle, tacitly parallel in number with
the first two, contained the twelve apostles, who manifested themselves
here as a sign of their approval of Solomon's words.  Were not the
apostles closely associated with the Holy Spirit, referred to in verse
76, represented as descending on them with the gift of tongues (Acts
2:3-4)?  And would not they represent a fitting final group of twelve
to accompany the first two who have come forward?  Mamiaro's might
still be a promising hypothesis, had not Peter Dronke, in an article
("'Orizzonte che rischiari,'" in his ^Dante and Medieval Latin
Traditions~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986 {1975}], esp.
pp. 10-16), demonstrated convincingly that what Dante has built into
his poem is a highly structured reference to Joachim of Flora's "Third
Age," "the Age of the [Holy] Spirit," when the Church shall be taken up
and each Christian living in the Spirit will be his or her own priest
(and thus the numerically unspecified multitude of these many souls [a
problem not well dealt with by Mamiaro's hypothesis]).  Consequently,
the first two circles in the Sun probably are related to Joachim's Age
of the Father and Age of the Son, respectively.  Dronke's thesis should
have found more favor than it has.  But see Picone ("Canto XIV," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 211) and Merlante and
Prandi (^La Divina Commedia~ [Brescia: La Scuola, 2005], in their
commentaries to vv. 28 and 76-78), acknowledging his contribution.  How
often in Dante studies can one say that a new reading has completely
altered our sense not only of the meaning of a text, but of its
intellectual provenance as well?  However, Dronke's discovery (he gives
credit, for a first effort in this direction, to Leone Tondelli [^Il
libro delle figure dell'abate Gioachino da Fiore~ {Turin: SEI, 1940}],
pp. 260-62) had in fact been made by another, some three score and ten
years earlier, John S. Carroll (comm. to these verses).  (And Carroll,
as far as one can see, has also been omitted from the post-Dronke
discussion.)  In a long gloss, a portion of which follows, Carroll
makes his case: "Now, it seems to me clear that Dante in this third
circle wished to show how far his sympathy with these Joachimite views
went.  In general, he accepts the doctrine of a third era of the Holy
Spirit.  If we take the three circles to correspond to the Trinity, we
may say that the first, the Dominican, represents the Father, the reign
of law and fear; and the second, the Franciscan, the Son, the favour of
the grace of Christ, whose image St. Francis bore.  But Dante believes
that these two types do not exhaust the possibilities of Theology.
Joachim and his followers were not mistaken in their hope for a third
era worthy to be called, in comparison with the others, the 'true
sparkling of the Holy Spirit,' far wider in its range, far more
brilliant in its shining.  Dante cannot describe it definitely; it lies
far off on the dim horizon of the future.  It has the mystery of the
evening when the stars are scarcely seen, for it is the passing away of
one era.  It has the mystery of the morning when the dawn whitens, for
it is the beginning of a new day of the Spirit -- perhaps the eternal
day itself."  It is instructive to note that if one searches on
"joachim" (or on "giovacchino") in all commentaries to Canto XIV
contained in the DDP, one gets eleven "hits," all found in Carroll's
single gloss.
(Only two current commentators discuss Joachim with reference to material in this canto.)
John Saly (^Dante's Paradiso: The Flowering of the Self:
An Interpretation of the Anagogical Meaning~ [New York: Pace University
Press, 1989], pp. 14-15) also sees this third circle of souls as
signifying Joachim's Third Age, but seems unaware of his precursors in
this belief.

The only problem inherent in the Carroll/Dronke hypothesis is that,
while the souls in the first two circles have all finished their lives
on earth and assumed their seats in the Empyrean, those in Joachim's
prophetic text have not.  On the other hand, there is no reason to
believe that Dante thought Joachim's Third Age had begun yet.  Thus his
text, like Joachim's, is prophetic, and Joachim is not the only
presence in the poem "di spirito profetico dotato" (endowed with the
spirit of prophecy -- ^Par~. XII.141).  Further, the imprecise nature
of their number and the fact that they are not recognizable to Dante
accords with their status as the unnumbered and unnamed ranks of a
Joachite New Age.  Singleton (comm. to vv. 74-76) correctly notes that
"the context and simile clearly suggest that they are a multitude and
not merely twelve lights."  Picone ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 212), having cited Dronke's argument (p.
211), somehow goes on to transmute the third circle (the first two
representing the canonical Christian "philosophers" [Canto X] and the
canonical Christian mytics [Canto XII]) into a new canon of Christian
poets, including Dante himself, possibly Statius, and those who are
still to be formed (or perhaps still to be born).  He further compounds
this fairly dubious proposal with an impossible one: this third crown
is perhaps the place that Dante will be situated in the afterworld ("la
sede paradisiaca preparata per il poeta della ^Commedia~"), in this
"new Parnassus."  Picone has apparently forgotten that these three
crowns, like all other manifestations of the saved in the heavens, are
only there for Dante's visit.

	|67.~  Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. to this verse) that, as usual, the
phrasing "Ed ecco" (And lo) alerts the reader to a change in focus.  We
might expect, as a result, a change of venue, e.g., the ascent to a
higher sphere.  But this is rather a totally new experience contained
within the current heaven, one that is marked off as being exceptional
in every way.

	|68.~  The word ^lustro~ (the noun "shining") occurs only one other
time in the poem (^Purg~. XXIX.16).  There it describes the brightness
of the Church Triumphant in procession as Matelda and Dante first
behold that pageant.

	|70-75.~  This simile, matching in its sweet tones and glowing, soft
colors the tranquility of verses 61-66, misled Vellutello (comm. to vv.
70-78) into thinking the ^novelle sussistenze~ were angels (as they
were in ^Par~. XIII.59) rather than souls, and Lombardi (comm. to vv.
70-75) into believing this circle is the first thing seen in the sphere
of Mars, rather than the last in the Sun.

	|72.~  For the (indefensible) notion that this third circle of saints
will eventually serve as home to "Virgil and the other honorable
inhabitants of Limbo" (Aristotle, Plato, Homer, etc.), see Maurizio
Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni dantesche: "Fiore", "Monarchia",
"Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003]), p. 133.

	|73.~  The word ^sussistenza~ (see the note to ^Par~. XIII.59) is here
used, by the consent of most discussants, to refer not to angelic
substances but to saved souls.  Tommaseo is quite sure, however, that
even that last use of the word refers to angels.  Benvenuto (comm. to
vv. 70-75) was perhaps the first reader to identify the ^sussistenze~
as "the blessed souls in this third circle."

	|76-81.~  If Dante is unable to look upon the working of the Holy
Spirit, evident in the movements of this circle, he can fix his eyes on
Beatrice's smile -- if he cannot bring that back to mind, for her
increased beauty is beyond the capacity of his memory.

While one can understand the theological reasons that make it
imperative to realize that Beatrice becomes more beautiful both as she
gets closer to God and as Dante's capacity to perceive her true nature
improves, had the poet stinted on the number of occasions he informs us
of their reciprocal progress, the likelihood is that few of us would
have complained.

	|82-87.~  The ascent to Mars is accomplished with relatively little
fanfare and as little poetic space as all but one ascent to a higher
sphere (Venus, at ^Par~. VIII.13-15) before it.  Cf. ^Paradiso~
I.61-81; V.88-99; X.28-39.

	|83.~  This is Dante's only use in his poem of the Latinism ^translato~
(in this context, literally "carried up to").  See Madison Sowell
("^Paradiso~ XIV," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings
III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~,
16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], p.
201) for the recognition of a biblical precursor.  Paul speaks of God's
having snatched us from the power of darkness and ^translated~ us to
His Son's kingdom, where we will dwell in light (Colossians 1:13).  But
see as well the only other presence of ^transferre~ in the New
Testament, also Pauline (as far as Dante knew, Paul was the writer of
the Epistle to the Hebrews): Hebrews 11:5.

	|86-87.~  That Mars is the "red planet" is an ancient tradition.  That
it becomes more red as a sign of welcome to Beatrice echoes the sign
made in response to her arrival in the planet Mercury (^Par~. V.96).

	|88-96.~  If the ascent to Mars is not particularly noteworthy, the
description of Dante's prayer of thanksgiving most certainly is.  There
are nine occurrences of hapax in these nine verses ^(olocausto,
essausto, litare, accetto, fausto, lucore, robbi, El,i@os, addobbi)~, a
sure sign of heightened emotion.  And the passage concludes with
Dante's first spoken words since Canto X (verse 81), as Teodolinda
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1992], p. 334, n. 8) has observed.
Language, as we shall see, is a continuing concern as we move through
this entire sphere.  Those who like to find Dante's identification of
the seven liberal arts with the planets in the ^Convivio~
(II.xiii.8-30) at work in ^Paradiso~ must here justify the prior
identification of Mars with music (^Conv~. II.xiii.20), a relationship
in ^Paradiso~ perhaps more plausibly adduced from the sphere of the Sun.

	|88.~  Portirelli (comm. to vv. 88-96) interprets the phrase "that
tongue which is the same for all" as meaning "the inner feelings of the
mind, the same in all languages," a view that had been widely embraced
as early as in the fourteenth century.  Dante is evidently referring to
mental constructions, pre-verbal thoughts, which match one another
perfectly until they are put into expression in various languages, when
they may have small resemblance to one another.  See John of Serravalle
(comm. to vv. 88-90): "Conceptus mentis sunt idem in omnibus hominibus,
loquela vero non sic" (Mental constructs are identical in all humans,
but not the words [that are used to express them]).  Dante is perhaps
suggesting that there exists an ideal universal vernacular innate in
all of us.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XV.39.

	|89.~  The word ^olocausto~ means, literally, "burnt offering," as
verse 92 makes plain.  For such sacrifice recorded in the Old
Testament, most memorably in Abraham's eventually jettisoned intention
to make a burnt-offering of his son, Isaac, see Genesis 22:2, 22:7,
22:8, 22:13.  See the prior reference in ^Paradiso~ V.29.

Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 88-90), the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 88-89)
and Pietro Alighieri (comm. to vv. 85-90) all say that "olocausto"
involves sacrifice of the whole object, while "sacrificio" involves
only a part of it.

	|94.~  The redness of Mars is insisted on once again, this time
increasing in its glow in response to Dante's offering of his gratitude.

	|95.~  The two beams, as we shall see, in fact constitute the cross of
Mars.

	|96.~  For the meaning of ^El,i@os~, Torraca (comm. to vv. 94-96) may
have been the first to cite Toynbee (^Dante Studies and Researches~
[Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1971 {1902}], p. 112) for Dante's
dependence on Uguccione da Pisa: "Ab ^ely~, quod est deus, dictus est
sol ^elyos~, quod pro deo olim reputabatur" (From ^ely~, which means
'God,' the sun, which once was considered God, is called ^elyos~).  The
protagonist may here be presented as speaking in tongues, or at least a
mixture of two biblical languages.  His first word in particular, the
name of God, reflects Hebrew (^Eli~ [see ^Purg~. XXIII.74]) and Greek
^(Helios)~.

The verb ^addobbare~ (a hapax in the poem, probably meaning "to adorn")
is generally understood to refer to the wearing of ornamental clothing,
since it usually refers to a person as being adorned, with the range of
the verb's meaning here being extended to light.  However, a persistent
temptation in the commentaries is to see the verb as reflecting the
French verb ^adober~ (English "dub"), as in striking a knight on the
shoulder with a sword as part of the ceremony that reflects his
worthiness.  See Giacalone (comm. to verse 96).

	|97-102.~  The first simile in the heaven of Mars compares the small,
nearly invisible, stars that make up the Milky Way (^la Galassia)~ to
the souls who make up the cross of Mars (for Dante's learned discussion
of the conflicting theories accounting for the existence of this
celestial phenomenon, see ^Convivio~ II.xiv.5-8).  Again, those who
want to argue for a correspondence between ^Convivio~'s alignment of
the human arts and sciences with the heavens of ^Paradiso~ face a large
(insurmountable?) problem.  In ^Convivio~ (II.xiv.5), Dante associates
^la Galassia~ with metaphysics.  Here it is associated neither with the
Sun (which may have created it) nor with the Fixed Stars (where Dante
locates it in ^Convivio~) but with Mars, associated with music in
^Convivio~ (see the end of the note to vv. 88-96).

	|101.~  Mars seems previously to have had both negative and positive
associations for Dante (see ^Conv~. II.xiii.20-24), if not the same
positive ones that we find in the ^Commedia~; in the earlier work Mars
is associated with musical harmony as well as the destructiveness of
war.  In the ^Commedia~, as the pagan god of war (e.g., ^Inf~.
XXIV.145; ^Inf~. XXXI.51; ^Purg~. XII.31), he is hardly praised.  In
his second aspect, he is sanitized (as he intrinsically is here) as the
representative of the Christian warrior.  C.S. Lewis (^The Discarded
Image~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1964], p. 106) pegs
Dante's positive sense of the pagan god to the term ^martire~ (martyr),
as derivative of "Mars."

	|103-108.~  These tercets contain the second set (of four) triple
identical rhymes on ^Cristo~ found in the poem (for the first, see
^Par~. XII.71-75; also see the note to that passage).

Beginning with the notice of the fact that the ^Cristo~-rhymes in
Cantos XIV and XIX of the ^Paradiso~ appear in exactly the same lines
(104, 106, and 108), Thomas Hart performs a series of calculations to
demonstrate that Dante had employed ratios used to calculate the
circumference of a circle to predetermine the precise locations in the
poem of all four of these rhymes; these ratios in turn suggest the
quadrants of a circumscribed Greek cross (formed by two diameters at
right angles to one another).  For more on the question of Dante's
numerical composition, see Thomas Hart's various studies, as referred
to in what may serve as a sort of compendium of them ("'Per misurar lo
cerchio' [^Par~. XXXIII 134] and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some
Thoughts on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la
scienza~, ed. P. Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp.
265-335).  And see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.136-141.

	|103.~  The ineffability of what the narrator has seen will become
increasingly a theme of the poem as it nears its (ineffable) vision of
God.  His poetic ability (and here ^ingegno~ clearly refers to Dante's
art, not God's [see the note to ^Inf~. II.7-9]) is simply not able to
represent adequately the amazing things that he is indeed capable of
holding in mind.  By the end of the poem, he will not be able to do
that, either.

	|106.~  Dante's phrasing follows closely the words of Christ in Matthew
16:24: "Let him who wishes to follow me deny himself and take up his
cross and follow me" (see Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 106-108] and
many others).

	|108.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) for a summary of the
debate over this line.  We have followed them in thinking the gerund
^vedendo~ describes Dante, and not the Christian soldier he is
addressing indirectly.  One of the main justifications for their
argument is the fact that no soul on its way to God should come by this
route (we are allowed to assume that all go directly to the Empyrean).
Further, and perhaps more tellingly, this cross of Christian soldiers
will no longer be here, since all who appear in all the spheres are
there only temporarily, for the sake of Dante's education.  On the
other hand, the passage does read more readily the "wrong" way.  And it
was only fairly recently that anyone objected to that understanding
(e.g., Torraca [comm. to vv. 106-108]), if that objection is both well
founded and fairly common, especially after Porena's final note to this
canto (found in the DDP at his comm. to vv. 106-108), entitled "una
distrazione di Dante."  Is this another instance of the unfinished
quality of Dante's last ^cantica~?  See the notes to ^Paradiso~
III.29-30 and IX.119-123.

For the verb ^balenare~ (to flash [said of lightning]), Carroll (comm.
to vv. 103-108) points to Matthew 24:27: "As the lightning comes out of
the east, and shines even unto the west, so shall also be the coming of
the Son of Man."  Carroll goes on to say that this is the first of
three visions of Christ in ^Paradiso~, the second occurring in Canto
XXIII.28-39, amidst the Church Triumphant.  The final vision occurs, of
course, in the concluding tercets of the poem.

Singleton's gloss to this verse follows this modern view (the gerund
[mistakenly referred to as a "present participle"] refers to Dante, but
he does not adapt the translation he is using, which reads "when he
sees Christ," while he translates the gerund in his commentary as "when
I beheld."

	|109-117.~  The first of two consecutive similes, this one has armies
of admirers for its small detail drawn from ordinary daily life, an
experience that all have known but never expected to find in an
"important" poem, the motes suspended in air irradiated in the streaks
of sunlight making their way through shutters.  We can almost observe
Dante observing them (see the note to ^Inf~. XXXII.70-72) and wondering
how to use them in his poem.  The range of this poet, his ability to
move back and forth between the lofty and the simple, is perhaps
unparalleled.  One is content to be counted among his admirers.

	|109.~  Singleton (comm. to this verse) reminds us that in Italian
(and, one might add, in Latin) the word ^corno~ can refer to the flank
of an army.  The observation is well taken, given, as Singleton says,
the "military context" of the setting here (of which there will be more
in the notes to the next canto).

	|110-111.~  The rapid movements of the souls along the two bands of the
cross have certain logistical implications, as we learn from these
verses, i.e., there seems to be more than one file of saints along each
band, since these souls catch up to and pass one another.  We remember
that in the preceding heaven, also, the souls, in their circles, were
both dancing and singing as, we are about to learn, those in this new
group are also.

	|114.~  Whether these ^minuzie~ (tiny motes) are, as we think, motes of
dust or, as some of the early commentators believe, "atoms," is not a
matter easily resolved.

	|117.~  This is the fourth (and final) appearance of the conjoined
pair, ^ingegno~ and ^arte~.  See the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.

	|118-126.~  See the note to ^Purg~. XXXII.61-62.  This melody, like the
"hymn" in that earlier passage, leaves Dante (at first) unable to make
out its words.  Here, however, he almost immediately does make out two
of them, "Resurgi" and "Vinci" (Arise and Conquer).  Landino (comm. to
vv. 124-126) points out that these two "Scriptural" words are sung to
Christ: "Arise and conquer," i.e., "Arise from death and conquer the
devil."  Grandgent (comm. to verse 125) finds a source in the missal
for Thursday of Easter Week (a most appropriate day, since it coincides
with the beginning of the poem), the sequence "Resumpta carne
^resurgit~ ^victor~ die in tertia" (He rose again, having taken on once
more His flesh, victorious on the third day).

For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

	|118-123.~  The second simile in this set (eighth and last in the
canto) captures the sonorous condition of the souls in Mars
accompanying their rapid movement along the arms of the cross.  This is
a canto that is more characterized by simile than perhaps any other.
See Picone ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
205), who counts nine (including one that may not be considered
formally a simile, if it does involve comparison, at vv. 34-36),
differing from Luigi Blasucci ("Discorso teologico e visione sensibile
nel canto XIV del ^Paradiso~," ^La Rassegna della letteratura italiana~
95 [1991]: 5-19), who enumerates ten because he includes the simple
comparison (see the note to ^Inf~. I.22-27) at verse 126.  Picone's
nine occur as follows: ^Paradiso~ XIV.1-9, 19-24, 34-36, 52-57, 67-69,
70-75, 97-102, 109-117, and here.)  For bibliography on the Dantean
simile, see Madison Sowell ("A Bibliography of the Dantean Simile to
1981," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]: 167-80) and, for more recent Italian
work, see Picone, ^op. cit~., p. 205n., including reference to
Pagliaro, "similitudine," ^ED~ V (1976), esp. 254a-57b, and Baldelli,
"lingua e stile," ^ED~ VI (1978), esp. pp. 94a-97b.

Dante habitually uses similes in profusion at moments of heightened
emotional or conceptual challenge, typically when the protagonist
experiences stress (e.g., when he meets Beatrice and is castigated by
her in ^Purg~. XXX) or when the poet requires expanded intellectual
powers (e.g., arriving in the Empyrean from the lower heavens in ^Par~.
XXX).

In ^Paradiso~ X.143 we have seen an earlier occurrence of the phrase
^dolce tintinno~ in the poem.  There it refers to the sound issuing
from a distant clock tower, here of two differing stringed instruments
playing in harmony.  The pleasure that a listener may take from music
without recognizing the tune was like the pleasure Dante took from
hearing the song these souls were singing without being able to make
out most of its words.

	|127-129.~  The tercet concludes with a playful but meaningful
identical rhyme: ^vinci~ (verb form derived from the Latin noun
^vinculum~ [shackles, bond]).  Christ conquered death, we conquer by
being bound to Him.  This is the highest recognition that Dante has yet
achieved, based on the experience of his selfless love of God.

	|130-139.~  Dante realizes that his reader may object to his apparent
slight of Beatrice.  These final ten verses of this extraordinary canto
function as a commentary on the previous tercet (vv. 127-129),
detailing Dante's increased love of God.  Here is Tozer's explanation
(comm. to vv. 133-139) of this convoluted, witty passage: "Dante here
justifies himself for having said that the melody which he had just
heard delighted him more than anything he had hitherto met with in
Paradise, by doing which he had assigned the second place to the joy of
seeing Beatrice's eyes.  In order to justify himself ^(Per escusarmi)~,
he accuses himself of not having looked at Beatrice's eyes since his
arrival in the Heaven of Mars (l. 135); and his excuse for this
^(Escusar puommi)~ is that he was attracted by the delights of that
Heaven, which surpassed those of the previous Heavens, according to the
system of Paradise, in which the beauty and joy increase in ascending
from sphere to sphere (ll. 133, 134).  Consequently, what he had said
about the delight of the melody of this Heaven surpassing all previous
delights was true, inasmuch as it is reconcilable with the superior
attractions of Beatrice's eyes, for their beauty had increased since
the Heaven of Mars had been reached, but Dante was not aware of this
because he had not seen them (ll. 138, 139)."  Tozer and most other
commentators take the verb ^dischiudere~, which usually (in the
^Commedia~ as well as in Italian generally) means something like its
English cognate, "to disclose," to signify, as they argue it also does
once earlier (^Par~. VII.102), "to exclude."   (But for disagreement
with this generally accepted variant meaning in both cases, see
Lodovico Cardellino ["'Dischiuso' in ^Paradiso~ 7.102 e 14.138: ha il
senso usuale di 'aperto' o 'espresso,' non di 'escluso,'" ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ {January 2006}].)  Our
understanding of most of the literal sense of these verses coincides
with that of Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 133-139).  That the word
"here" ^(qui)~ refers to the poem is nearly guaranteed by its
distinction from the "there" ^(l@i)~ of line 135.  (See the similar
situation addressed in the note to ^Inf~. XXIX.54-57).

For an English paraphrase of this difficult passage, see Tozer (comm.
to vv. 133-139).

For the argument that the final thirteen lines of the canto comprise a
sort of "pseudo-sonnet," revisiting in corrective ways the sonnet on
the Garisenda tower (^Rime~ 51), in which Dante curses his eyes for
looking at a tower in Bologna, thereby missing the passing form of his
lady, see Picone ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], pp. 215-17).

	|133.~  There has been continuing debate about the question, to what do
"i vivi suggelli" (living seals) refer?  See Scartazzini (comm. to this
verse) for an exhaustive presentation of the state of the question at
the close of the nineteenth century.  And now see Lodovico Cardellino
("I 'vivi suggelli' in ^Paradiso~ 14.133," ^Electronic Bulletin of the
Dante Society of America~ [February 2006]), bringing the history of the
debate up to date and giving strong reasons for not believing that the
"suggelli" refer exclusively to the beauty of Beatrice, but to all
things that Dante gazes on in the heavens, whether spheres or souls,
all "sealed" by God with an aspect of His beauty.
