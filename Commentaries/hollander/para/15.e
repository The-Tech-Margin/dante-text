	|1-6.~  Perhaps it is the result of the only necessary relative absence
of narrative in ^Paradiso~, but the opening passages of many of its
cantos show contorted construction and convoluted phrasing, an
authorial self-consciousness that is more present than it had been in
the first two ^cantiche~.  Narrative has its own excuse for being;
theology at least seems to require justification, perhaps nowhere more
so than in a poem.  These two tercets are among those least afflicted,
but still are not exactly easy.  A possible paraphrase is: "The will
that would perform good deeds and that always reveals itself in
well-purposed love (as does evil will in a love of the things of this
world) silenced the singing that God Himself makes harmonious."  That
is, the dancing choir of saints (see ^Par~. XIV.109-123) grew quiet
(and ceased moving) in order to welcome Dante to this heaven and to
invite his questions.  Their "harmony" is, in Dante's metaphor, the
result of God's "hand" having tuned the "strings" of the "instrument"
that their voices represent.

	|1-2.~  The themes of love and will may remind us of the discourse in
the middle cantos of ^Purgatorio~, Marco Lombardo's lofty praise of the
(free) will.

	|1.~  A question here involves the verb, whether it is a form of
^liquare~ (to liquify) or ^liquere~ (to be manifest).  Most choose the
latter alternative, believing Dante treated the second-conjugation
Latin verb as though it were among those of the first conjugation and
also made it reflexive.  Since it occupies the rhyme position, thus
preparing the reader to grant the poet a perhaps larger amount of
license, it is difficult to fault this view, and we have followed it in
our translation.  See, however, Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to
the ^Paradiso~, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001], p. 64) for several related arguments in favor of the minority
view, among which are: (1) the conceptually related words ^liquor~
(^Purg~. XXII.137 and ^Par~. XXI.115) and ^liquefatta~ (^Purg~. XXX.88)
establish a context that supports the less popular reading; (2) since
at the beginning of cantos Dante tends to cite other texts, the sense
of "liquefy" would then point to the Song of Soloman (Cant.5.6: "anima mea liquefacta est"); (3)
the good love that St. Augustine identifies as the love of God (^DcD~
XII.ix.2) is what Dante is speaking of here.  Some of these arguments
are less trenchant than others, but his views are worth study.

Singleton (comm. to ^Par~. XV.1) once again has one thing in his
commentary ("manifests itself") and another in the translation it
accompanies ("resolves itself").  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XIV.108.

	|4-6.~  For the recent deployment of a similar image (of a stringed
instrument that has been tuned), see ^Paradiso~ XIV.118-120.

	|7-12.~  Resembling an indirect address to the reader, this passage
begins with a rhetorical question (vv. 7-9) and ends in an apothegm.
The courtesy of these saved souls in ceasing their joyful celebrative
behavior in order to attend to a still-mortal being is adduced as
evidence for the efficacy of prayer and as a rebuke to all on earth who
think present pleasures exceed in value such exalted ones as these.

	|8.~  The word ^sustanze~ here, like ^sussistenze~ in the last canto
(see ^Par~. XIV.73), does not refer to angels but to saved souls.  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XIII.59.

	|12.~  This is the third time the word ^amor~ (love) appears in these
verses: see also verses 2 and 11.  After ^Inferno~ V, with ten
appearances in 68 lines (and two "triplets" at vv. 61-69 and 100-106,
occurring in nine and seven lines, respectively), this is one of the
densest groupings of the word in the poem, with three occurrences in
eleven lines (but see the identical phenomenon in ^Purg~. XVII.104-114
and the even more compact threesome in ^Par~. V.1-10 and the
"champion," ^Par~. XXI.67-82, with three occurrences in eight lines and
four in sixteen).  And see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVI.18-62.

	|13-24.~  Only the first nine verses of this passage formally
constitute a simile.  From the first (e.g., Jacopo della Lana [comm. to
vv. 13-18]), commentators have insisted that the celestial phenomena
are not falling stars, but ignited vapors, referring to Aristotle's
^Meteora~ as their authority.  Beginning with Daniello (comm. to vv.
13-15), later commentators have sought a classical poetic source for
this "shooting star" in one of three places: in Ovid (^Metam~.
II.319-322 [Phaeton]) or in Virgil (^Georg~. I.365-367 [stars falling
from the skies] and ^Aen~. II.692-703 [the portentous shooting star or
-- more likely -- comet that appears to Anchises' request for an omen
of Jupiter's approval of his flight from Troy]).  Since the neighboring
tercet's context (vv. 25-27) aligns Anchises with Cacciaguida, that has
seemed to some the more likely source.  However, it is only in Ovid
that we find words that seem to be mirrored in Dante's description of
the celestial phenomenon: the star has not in fact fallen, if it seemed
to have fallen ("etsi non cecidit, potuit cecidisse videri").

	|22-24.~  That is, in its approach before its descent, this "star"
follows the right angle made by the "arm" and the "stem" of the cross.
For Dante's earlier treatment of the cross of Mars, see ^Convivio~
II.xiii.22: "This is also why in Florence, at the beginning of its
ruin, there was seen in the sky in the shape of a cross a great
quantity of these vapors which accompany the star of Mars" (tr. R.
Lansing).

The apsidal chapel dedicated to the local martyr of Ravenna, St.
Apollinaris, in the church dedicated to his memory, S. Apollinare in
Classe, displays over the altar a mosaic cross that has jewels depicted
as being embedded in it, with Christ's face as the central jewel,
located at the transverse of its two elements.  Is it possible that
Dante was thinking of that particular cross?  We do not know whether he
visited Ravenna before he moved there, ca. 1317-19, nor when he
composed these cantos (but see the last paragraph of the note to ^Par~.
IX.29-30, reporting on the possibility that that canto reflected the
pressure of the recent past, the years 1314-1315).  Petrocchi's dating
of the composition of the last ^cantica~ would have it begun ca. 1317.
And so it is at least possible that the greater portion of ^Paradiso~
was composed in Ravenna.  At any rate, Jeffrey Schnapp (^The
Transfiguration of History at the Center of Dante's "Paradise"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986], pp. 171-203) offers
detailed arguments that locate various architectural features of
Ravenna in the texts of the central cantos of ^Paradiso~, including the
mosaic found in this chapel, with its jeweled cross (pp. 180-85).  And
see Giovannella Desideri ("Riscontri iconografici nell'^Epistola a
Cangrande~," ^Critica del testo~ 4 [2001]: 575-78) for another effort
to document the influence of Veronese artifacts on Dante.

	|24.~  Alabaster is a creamy white stone, softly translucent, so that
it could, when hollowed in such a way as to contain wax and a wick, be
used as a light (particularly for votive purposes).  Dante goes
existing technology one better, imagining the cross of Mars as hollow
and somehow having moving lights within that space.

	|25-27~.  All are in agreement about the Virgilian provenance of this
simile.  Itself representing paternal affection, it is perhaps the most
obvious and filial affection shown by the poet to ^his~ poetic father,
Virgil, since he left the poem in the earthly paradise (^Purg~. XXX).
See ^Aeneid~ VI.684-686, a description of the shade of Anchises
welcoming his living son to the Elysian Fields.  (See the note to
^Purg~. II.79-81.)  What exactly we are to make of the reference is a
matter of some dispute and more than a little complexity.

On this passage see Schnapp ("'S@i p,ia l'ombra d'Anchise si porse':
^Paradiso~ 15.25," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991], pp. 145-56, 279-80).  And, for his
earlier consideration of it, see Schnapp (^The Transfiguration of
History at the Center of Dante's "Paradise"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1986], pp. 203-15).  He had in that earlier study (p.
69) discussed the cross-pollination of "the Virgilian thematics of epic
sacrifice" and Dante's "new epic of Christ and of His cross" (see also
pp. 143-49, 215-31).

Surprisingly, this may be the first obvious citation of Virgil's text
(^Aen~. VI.684-686) in quite some time, and it is surely the most
vibrant one so far in ^Paradiso~.  While there have been several at
least generally Virgilian contaminations, this is the first pellucidly
precise one since ^Paradiso~ VIII.9.  Before that, the last great
Virgilian flowering occurred in ^Purgatorio~ XXX (vv. 21, 48, 49-51,
52, 59-60 -- see Hollander ["Le opere di Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di
Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia: Autorit@a e sfida
poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci {Ravenna: Longo, 1993}], pp. 317-18).
From the beginning of the ^Paradiso~ it may have seemed that Virgil had
been left behind as the main classical source in favor of Ovid (see the
last paragraph of the note to ^Par~. I.68).  For discussion see
Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1983], pp. 134-35).

See Giorgio Brugnoli ("Dante e l'^interpretatio Vergiliana~," ^Critica
del testo~ 5 [2002]: 471-76) for his most recent (and, unhappily,
final) insistence that Dante's Virgil needs to be read through the
filter of intervening lenses.  In this case Brugnoli is discussing the
erroneous translation of Virgil (^Aen~. VI.664-666) found in ^Convivio~
(II.v.13-14), observed as being possibly caused by the versions found
in Servius and Proba's ^cento~.

	|25.~  Anchises' affectionate gesture of welcome to his son, a visitor
in the Elysian Fields (^Aen~. VI.684-686), is clearly recalled here.
Less clear is the validity of the Schnappian claim (^The
Transfiguration of History at the Center of Dante's "Paradise"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986], pp. 203-6) that the
gesture is taken by Dante to be an unconscious Virgilian representation
of the Christian posture of prayer, the so-called "orant pose" (both
hands raised, open toward one stationed in front of the figure) as seen
in Saint Apollinaris beneath the mosaic of the bejewelled cross in the
apsidal chapel of his church in Ravenna (see the note to vv. 22-24).
Schnapp's thesis is appealing; however, Anchises holds his hands out
toward his son, not upwards with palms raised, as far as we can tell
from Virgil's text.

	|26.~  It is a commonplace in the commentaries to say that "musa" here
means "poet."  See, among others, Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to
vv. 25-27): "qui major musa, idest poeta, latinorum est" (who was the
greatest muse, that is, poet, among the Romans).  And see ^Convivio~
IV.xxvi.8, where Dante refers to Virgil as "lo maggiore nostro poeta,"
and ^Monarchia~ II.iii.6, where the Latin master is "divinus poeta
noster Virgilius."  However, Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Par~. XVIII.33)
offer strong reasons for taking ^musa~ to mean the text of the ^Aeneid~
rather than its author.

The first commentator apparently even to sense the possible
condescension toward Virgil in this verse was Carlo Steiner (comm. to
vv. 26-27), who attempts to downplay its significance.  That it took
seven hundred years for a reader to say that this compliment might even
seem to be backhanded is, one might say, remarkable.  Dante could
easily have avoided introducing this concern about how much faith we
should give to Virgil's poem as a record of event.  Merely to lodge the
doubt is enough to identify Dante's motive, which is to call into
question Virgil's final authority when faced with the certainties of
the world of Revelation, in which the protagonist now finds himself.
(Of course, we can turn the same question back onto Dante, whose poem
also may not merit our belief, either; it is a dangerous game that he
has chosen to play.  And he knows that.)  Mattalia (comm. to verse 26)
is a good deal more firm than Steiner, and sees the point of Dante's
insistence on the fictitious nature of Virgil's account, but goes on to
claim that Dante believed in the historicity of the events he narrates
(a difficult position to accept as soon as one asks the inevitable
question, "Do the events narrated as taking place in the Elysian Fields
have any verifiable reality outside Virgil's text?").  The firmest
sense of the failing being lodged against Virgil found in contemporary
commentaries is perhaps that of Singleton (comm. to this verse),
sending the reader to his earlier comment (to ^Inf~. II.13).  And see
the note to ^Inferno~ II.28.  Nonetheless, the first clear statement of
the problematic aspects of these dubiety-creating references to the
^Aeneid~ is probably Grandgent's (^Inf~. II [Nota]): "It is worth
noting that in introducing the example of Aeneas, Dante begins with 'tu
dici che ... ,' and a few lines further on he uses the phrase 'questa
andata onde gli dai tu vanto'; so in ^Par.~ XV, 26, referring to the
same episode, he adds 'se fede merta nostra maggior Musa,' meaning
Virgil.  These expressions seem to imply a mental reservation with
regard to the literal veracity of Aeneas's adventure."  And see
Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1983], pp. 135-36).

	|28-30.~  This is the only tercet in the poem entirely in Latin: "O
blood of mine, O grace of God poured down from above, to whom, as to
you, shall the gates of heaven have ever been opened twice."  Indeed, only
St. Paul is, alongside of Dante, in such glorious company, as far as we
(or Dante) can know.

While it has pronouncedly Virgilian and biblical elements, the tercet
is also Dante's brief answer to an unspoken challenge (until Giovanni
del Virgilio, around 1320, had the dubious taste to offer him a chance
at the laurel from Bologna in exchange for a truly worthy poem, a
political one cast, more nobly than was this lowly ^Comedy~, in Latin
[see the note to ^Par~. IX.29-30]).  He undoubtedly earlier had come
into contact with others who thought that he should have eschewed the
vernacular to write his poem in Latin, in the tradition of classical
poetry.  That, after all, is what Albertino Mussato had done.

For an overview of the situation of Latin writing in relation to the
formation and development of the European vernaculars, see Marc Van
Uytfanghe ("Le latin et les langues vernaculaires au Moyen Age: un
aper$cu panoramique," in ^The Dawn of the Written Vernacular in Western
Europe~, ed. M. Goyens and W. Verbeke, in ^Mediaevalia Lovaniensia~
[2003], Series 1, Studia 33, pp. 1-38).

The Virgilian elements in the tercet include the words ^sanguis meus~,
widely recognized as a citation of the ^Aeneid~ (^Aen~. VI.835).
Anchises is addressing Julius Caesar and asking him to cast away his
sword (rather than put it to use in bloody civil war): "proice tela
manu, sanguis meus!"  That speech ends with Anchises's fervid hope that
Rome will spare the defeated and bring down the prideful (^Aen~.
VI.853: "parcere subiectis et debellare superbos").  If that was her
mission, Virgil knows how badly she failed in it.  But there is a much
less frequently cited possible second citation, in verse 30, a
reference to the Sibyl's admonition; if Aeneas is so eager for his
perilous journey, she will guide him.  She expresses the danger
awaiting him in two examples of passage into the land of the dead and
back (^Aen~. VI.134-135), twice crossing the Styx, twice seeing black
Tartarus ("bis Stygios innare lacus, bis nigra videre / Tartara").  It
can certainly be argued that what Dante has done here is to take the
fairly glum passage in Virgil and brighten the context considerably,
the futile challenge to civil discord in Rome become the crusader's
welcome to his "son," Aeneas's journey through Hell become this son's
unique voyage to salvation.

See Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with understanding~,"
Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance
Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and
Studies, 1992], pp. 36-39) for the possibility that this tercet
involves an elaborate response to Paul's concern with our speaking
"five words with understanding" (I Cor. 14:19) rather than "ten
thousand in tongues."  All three Latin verses contain five words, and
are pronouncedly ^not~ the nonsense that we heard in the five words
shouted by Plutus and Nimrod (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.1).

That Cacciaguida's first words are in Latin, both biblical (at least
generically) and Virgilian, accomplishes one of Dante's aims.  It
establishes his ancestor as speaker of the doubly significant
"grammatical" tongue, that of God and man, Church and empire.  As
Dante's spiritual and fleshly father, he is perfectly fitted to meet
his son's needs.

	|28.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 66) points
out that the protagonist has himself once used ^sangue~ in this precise
sense (i.e., to denote bloodline), referring to Geri del Bello (^Inf~.
XXIX.20).  And now his ancestor uses the word, in Latin, to identify
Dante as his seed.  All but ten of the forty-seven occurrences of the
noun ^sangue~ in the poem in fact refer to blood in its physical sense.
 In all, five speakers other than the protagonist refer to this
definition of family with the word ^sangue~: Virgil speaks of families
in general (^Inf~. VII.80); Dante the poet speaks of the ruling house
of Thebes (^Inf~. XXX.2); the poet curses the bloodline of "Alberto
tedesco" (^Purg~. VI.101); Omberto Aldobrandesco speaks of his family
line (^Purg~. XI.61); Pope Adrian V refers to his (^Purg~. XIX.102);
Hugh Capet twice refers to his dynasty with the word (^Purg~. XX.62 and
^Purg~. XX.83); the poet reflects on the paltry nobility conferred by
bloodlines (^Par~. XVI.1).

Aversano also gives biblical passages establishing the meaning here as
"pour down from above."

	|29.~  Some readers have reflected that this verse would seem to put
Dante in a class by himself, since Paul claims (II Corinthians 12:2) a
celestial ascent only as far as the third heaven.  But see the note to
^Paradiso~ I.73 for notice that traditional understanding of the
passage identified Paul's "third heaven" with the Empyrean.

	|30.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 28-30) says that this, Dante's first
visit to the realms of Paradise, is made in the flesh, while the next
one will not be (i.e., Dante's soul will fly up without his body after
his death).  Of course, he is destined to get that body back at the
general resurrection.

	|31.~  While this "light" does not choose to identify himself until
verse 135, it is perhaps good to have some sense of Dante's
great-great-grandfather, who is speaking in this scene, "of whose life
nothing is known beyond what Dante himself tells us; viz. that he was
born in Florence (^Par~. XV.130-133) in the Sesto di Porta san Piero
(^Par~. XVI.40-42) about the year 1090 (^Par~. XVI.34-39); that he
belonged (possibly) to the Elisei, one of the old Florentine families
which boasted Roman descent (^Par~. XV.136; ^Par~. XVI.40); that he was
baptized in the baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence (^Par~.
XV.134-135); that he had two brothers, Moronto and Eliseo (^Par~.
XV.136); that his wife came from the valley of the Po, and that from
her, through his son, Dante got his surname of Alighieri (^Par~.
XV.91-94, ^Par~. XV.137-138); that he followed the Emperor Conrad III
on the Second Crusade, and was knighted by him (^Par~. XV.139-144), and
finally that he fell fighting against the infidel about the year 1147
(^Par~. XV.145-148)" (Toynbee, "Cacciaguida" [^Concise Dante
Dictionary~])

	|32-33.~  The protagonist makes up for his previous "failure" to look
at Beatrice in the last canto (XIV.127-132).

Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 66) claims
that stupefaction is experienced only twice in the Bible, both times in
the responses of those who beheld a holy event, citing Mark 9:14
(regarding the populace after the Transfiguration) and Acts 9:6-7
(regarding those who witness what is to them strange behavior on the
part of Saul on the road to Damascus).  But see also Acts 2:7-12, which
perhaps contains a more relevant context than those two passages.
After the apostles found they were able to "translate" words spoken in
tongues into their own language, they were amazed.  This is the first
use of the word ^stupefatto~ in the poem.  It will twice be used again
(^Par~. XXVI.80 and ^Par~. XXXI.35).  On the last of these it will
refer to the reaction of the pilgrim approaching Rome who sees the city
for the first time.

	|34-36.~  Her smile shows that Beatrice recognizes that Dante has
understood his identity better than ever before, biologically, but more
importantly in terms of his family's heritage, and, still more
importantly, as a "Roman" and a Christian, assured of his salvation.

	|36.~  For a recent disagreement with Petrocchi's support for the
less-favored variant "gloria" (rather than the more usual "grazia"),
see Lodovico Cardellino ("La gloria @e 'lo fondo de la ... grazia'
[^Par~. 15.35-36]," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of
America~ [July 2007]).  While Cardellino is probably correct in
criticizing Petrocchi for believing that "gloria" is ^difficilior~, his
argument for "grazia" (as is that of the precursors whom he names) is
possibly based on a misprision of what the verse refers to.  For those
of us who follow Petrocchi in this detail, the text refers precisely to
Dante's sense of "prelibating" his future bliss.  This seems a
perfectly reasonable interpretation, even the more natural one.  Those
who argue that one can only sense the force of God's glory in the
afterlife, in other words, fail to understand that Dante is conflating
his present bliss with that which he expects to feel in the afterlife
-- and, indeed, in a very few hours, when, as Beatrice has promised
him, he will experience "l'ultima salute" (^Par~. XXII.124) in his
flesh (when Christ and his Church descend in Canto XXIII).  Sometimes
philological correctness is hyper-correct.

	|37-42.~  This is Cacciaguida's second kind of speech, one that the
protagonist is unable to understand.  For some reason Andr$e P$ezard
("Les trois langues de Cacciaguida," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 16
[1967]: 217-38) does not include this passage in his consideration of
the "tongues" spoken by Cacciaguida (he deals with items 1, 3, and 4 in
the listing below).  This list is found in Hollander ("Babytalk in
Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], pp.
125-27 (for some further consideration, see Hollander [^Dante and
Paul's "five words with understanding~," Occasional Papers, No. 1,
Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Texts and Studies
{Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992}, pp.
38-39, n. 57]).  However, it seems clear that the reader must consider
four languages as spoken by Cacciaguida: (1) vv. 28-30, Latin; (2)
37-42, speech that the protagonist could not recognize; (3) vv. 47-48,
the Italian of Dante's time; (4) ^Paradiso~ XVI.34-36, the vernacular
of Cacciaguida's day.  For support for this view, see Claire Honess
("Communication and Participation in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^In
amicizia: Essays in Honour of Giulio Lepschy~, ed. Z.G. Baranski and L.
Pertile [^The Italianist~ 17 {1997 -- special supplement}], p. 130).

	|39.~  Poletto (comm. to vv. 37-39) seems to have been the first
commentator to notice the closeness of this line to the tenth verse of
the last poem of the ^Vita nuova~ (XLI.12): "io non lo intendo, s@i
parla sottile" (I cannot understand the subtle words it [his pilgrim
spirit, having visited Paradise and seen Beatrice] speaks [tr. M.
Musa]).  Benvenuto explains (comm. to vv. 37-42) that Cacciaguida was
speaking of pure mental constructs ^(conceptiones mentales)~ that
transcend mere humans' ability to understand.  (See the note to ^Par~.
XIV.88.)  On the other hand, Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 37-48) and
Cristoforo Landino (comm. to vv. 37-39) both think the context of his
first words in Latin, regarding Dante's status as one of the elect (vv.
28-30), point to the issue of predestination, a position that Sapegno
(comm. to vv. 37-42) brings back into consideration, as several others
do also.  Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in
Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], pp. 115-29)  is of the opinion that this
linguistic behavior on the part of Dante's ancestor may reflect either
Adamic vernacular or the apostles' speaking in tongues.  There is, in
short, no consensus about how to read this verse.  But see the note to
vv. 43-48.

	|40-42.~  Benvenuto's hypothesis (see the note to verse 39) concerning
"mental constructs" would seem to be certified by these lines, which
tell us that Cacciaguida was not trying to hide his words from Dante
but that the language he employed simply overshot its human target,
that is, Cacciaguida had momentarily forgotten that Dante was not yet
"immortal," that, in other words, his intelligence still was limited by
his humanity.

The word ^concetto~ represents an important element in Dante's
vocabulary of consciousness.  Used as a singular noun for the first
time in ^Inferno~ XXXII.4 (where it refers to the mental construct
Dante has in his brain of the lowest landscape of Hell), it does not
reappear until here (for the rest of its "career" in the poem, see the
note to ^Par~. XXXIII.127).

	|43-48.~  These six lines perhaps offer some clarification of the
nature of Cacciaguida's ununderstandable utterance (vv. 37-42).  First,
he seems to have been addressing God, and certainly not Dante; second,
if the words he speaks now flow from the ones he uttered then, they,
too, were words of thanksgiving for God's grace to his descendant.

	|44.~  See Tobias Leuker ("Sfoghi e sospiri in Dante," ^L'Alighieri~ 20
[2002]: 121-22), arguing that the word ^(sfogato)~ here means "deprived
of energy, weakened, exhausted."

	|48.~  This is the last appearance in the poem of the adjective
^cortese~ (literally, "courtly" [i.e., of the court], and hence
"courteous" [i.e., behaving as a courtier does -- or should do]).  It
transforms the usual sense of the word, which often associates it with
"courtly love," into heavenly affection, a rather pronounced
Nietzschean "transvaluation of values."  Dante had already availed
himself of a similar strategic displacement at the end of the ^Vita
nuova~, when he refers to God as the "sire de la cortesia" (the Lord of
graciousness [tr. M. Musa]).  The first time we hear the noun for
"court" in ^Inferno~ (II.125), it is used to indicate "la corte del
cielo" (the court of Heaven); human courts are characterized (^Inf~.
XIII.66), on the other hand, by ^invidia~ (envy), the "whore" found,
according to Pier della Vigna, at courts.  The "court of heaven" is
referred to three times in ^Purgatorio~ (XVI.41; XXI.17; XXXI.41) and
nine times in ^Paradiso~ (III.45; VII.51; X.70; XXI.74; XXIV.112;
XXV.43; XXVI.16; XXX.96; XXXII.98).

	|50.~  For ^volume~, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XII.122.  To what
"volume" does Cacciaguida refer?  Where today commentators are
unanimous in their opinion, it is amusing to read Jacopo della Lana on
the problem.  According to him (comm. to vv. 49-50) and to perhaps one
other (the Anonimo Fiorentino [comm. to vv. 49-51]), it is the
^Aeneid~.  The ^Codice cassinese~ (comm. to this verse) is perhaps the
first to deliver the standard gloss: the mind of God.  With few
exceptions, this is the common opinion during seven hundred years of
commentary.  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 49-51) suggests that the reference
may also be to the Apocalypse (3:3), the Book of Life, in which the
names of all the saved are recorded.  Insofar as we are supposed to
think of God's mind as containing this book (and, since it contains
infinity, it must), we realize that Cacciaguida has read in it Dante's
salvation.

	|50-54.~  Cacciaguida is using lofty diction to say that Dante's
arrival has satisfied the long craving he has experienced (dating, we
assume, from his arrival in the Empyrean ca. 1147) to see his
descendant's arrival in the heavens, about which he read in God's mind,
credit for which he gives to Beatrice.

	|51.~  That is to say, the words in this "book" are unchanging, unlike
those in human manuscripts, where scribes variously blot, erase, add
to, and cross out previous texts.  Cf. ^Paradiso~ XVII.37-39.  And see
Torraca (comm. to vv. 49-51) for a reflection of this verse in the
opening line of Dante's first ^Eclogue~ to Giovanni del Virgilio:
"Vidimus in nigris albo patiente lituris..." (In letters black, upon
receptive white, I saw...).

	|54.~  It is not difficult to believe that Dante is here revisiting a
theme dear to him, the ill-fated flight of Icarus (see ^Inf~.
XVII.109-111 and XXIX.113-116; ^Par~. VIII.125-126), but now starring
Beatrice as a better-artificing Daedalus and Dante as non-falling
wonderboy.  See the note to verse 72.

	|55-69.~  "Cacciaguida tells Dante that he understands the reason why
he does not inquire his name and the cause of his interest in him,
which is, that he (Dante) is aware that the denizens of Heaven see the
thoughts of others through the medium of the mind of God which reflects
them in every detail; and consequently that it is unnecessary for him
to state in words what he wishes to be told him, because his wishes are
already fully known to Cacciaguida.  Still, he encourages Dante to
speak, because his (Cacciaguida's) love will be increased by complying
with his request" (Tozer, comm. to these verses).

	|56-57.~  See Grandgent (comm. to verse 56): "^Raia~, 'radiates.'
Unity is the beginning of number, as God is the beginning of thought;
from the conception of unity is derived the conception of all numbers,
and in the divine mind all thought is contained."  In support of his
remark he refers to the work of Helen Flanders Dunbar (^Symbolism in
Medieval Thought and Its Consummation in the "Divine Comedy"~ [New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1929]), p. 336.  Cf. ^De vulgari~
I.xvi.2.

	|68.~  Will and desire are the hallmarks of the soul's affective
knowing and wise loving in Paradise.  As Tommaseo pointed out long ago
(comm. to vv. 67-69), the ^cantica~ will conclude with these two
spiritual movements in Dante operating harmoniously (^Par~. XXXIII.143).

	|72.~  Dante apparently could not resist a second reference to Beatrice
as Daedalus (see the note to verse 54).  And see Hollander (^Il
Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki,
1983], p. 135n.), pointing out that there seems to be a "Daedalus
program" in this part of the poem: ^Paradiso~ VIII.125, X.74-75,
XIII.77-78, and here, representing, according to him (p. 136n.),
something bordering on the obsessive.

	|73-84.~  This tortured preamble to a simple question ("what's your
name?") is paraphrased by Tozer (comm. to these verses) as follows:
"Dante here excuses himself for being unable to thank Cacciaguida as he
would wish to do for his benevolence.  The ground of his excuse is
that, whereas in Heaven a feeling ^(affetto)~ is accompanied by an
equivalent power of thought ^(senno)~, through which that feeling can
find expression, this is not the case with mortal men, for in them the
means ^(argomento)~ of expressing feeling fall short of the wish to do
so ^(voglia)~."

	|74.~  The term ^equalit@a~, a hapax, has considerable theological
weight.  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 68) cites
Richard of St. Victor, ^De Trinitate~ VI.xxi: "Quid summa aequalitas
sit in illa Trinitate, ubi oportet omnes aeque perfectos esse" [What
very great equality there must be in that Trinity, in which it is
necessary for all the elements to be equally perfect].  And see,
Aversano goes on, St. Bernard (^PL~ CLXXXIII.646).  See also Apoc.
21:16, where the new Jerusalem is described in the following terms:
"The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."  Aversano
continues by adducing the gloss of Alain de Lille (^PL~ CCX.445) to his
fourth ^regula theologica~: "in Patre unitas, in Figlio ^[sic]~
aequalitas, in Spiritu sancto unitatis aequalitatisque connexio" [in
the Father, uniqueness; in the Son, likeness; in the Holy Spirit, the
link between uniqueness and likeness].  Aversano also cites Richard of
St. Victor, quoting Augustine, on this relation between the first two
Persons in his ^De Tribus appropriatis personis in Trinitate~ (^PL~
CXCVI.992).

If one thinks about the "aesthetics" of the Christian religion (and of
Dante's poem), one has a sense of the centrality of both uniqueness and
of likeness.  This is nowhere more readily apparent than in the Second
Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ, a uniquely human being (because he
is also the immortal God) and yet a commonly human being (because He
was also mortal).  And, it is perhaps fair to suggest, this theme has
nowhere before in the poem been quite so evident or so important as it
has become in this canto.

	|81.~  The phrase "pennuti in ali" (feathered wings) picks up (from
verse 54 ["vest@i le piume"] and verse 72 ["crescer l'ali"]) to make
this one of the densest insistences on Dante's heavenly flight in the
poem.  See Hugh Shankland's two studies ("Dante 'Aliger,'" ^Modern
Language Review~ 70 [1975]: 764-85; "Dante 'Aliger' and Ulysses,"
^Italian Studies~ 32 [1977]: 21-40) for discussion of the pun on the
poet's surname (Alighieri) available in the Latin adjective for
"winged," ^aliger~.

	|85.~  The protagonist addresses his ancestor as "topaz."  The
gemological term, in the plural, will be used only once more (^Par~.
XXX.76), and then to refer to the angels.  Aversano points out (^Dante
daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the
author on 11 September 2001], p. 68) that the ninth of the twelve
foundations of the walls of the new Jerusalem (Apoc. 21:19-20), which
is characterized by its ^equalitas~ (see the note to verse 74), was
constructed out of topaz.  Alain de Lille, cited by Aversano, ^ibid~.,
says that there are two colors of topaz, sky-blue and golden.  Aversano
goes on to argue that the latter color is reflected again when
Cacciaguida is referred to (^Par~. XVII.123) as a golden mirror.

	|87.~  We perhaps have already forgotten the elaborate preparation for
this simple question.  Cacciaguida says that he already knows what
Dante wants to ask but wants him to ask it anyway, to bring him greater
pleasure (vv. 55-69); and then Dante spends nearly as much poetic space
(vv. 73-84) explaining why he cannot express his gratitude for
Cacciaguida's welcome.  That the inquiry about Cacciaguida's identity
took so long to make it from Dante's lips is, perhaps, amusing, a sort
of Scholastic joke, the sort of thing that would offer Rabelais, two
centuries later, endless opportunity for spirited (and antagonistic)
amusement at the expense of medieval modes of expression.  However,
Dante may have felt that the reader (even the fourteenth-century
reader) may have needed to be reminded of the gulf that separates souls
that have come to God, enjoying an eternal and quasi-angelic spiritual
existence, and even ultimately favored mortals, like Dante Alighieri.
When we consider this aspect of the third ^cantica~, we probably all
agree that the poet manages to present himself as feeling proper
humility at finding himself prematurely among the blessed, something
that is not perhaps as often observed as it might be.  For a useful
presentation of what is known about Cacciaguida, see Fiorenzo Forti,
"Cacciaguida," ^ED~ I (1970).

	|88-135.~  For the perhaps surprising presence of so many virtuous
women representing "the good old days" (for this phrase see Davis, who,
in an article entitled "Il buon tempo antico" [in ^Florentine Studies:
Politics and Society in Renaissance Florence~, ed. N. Rubenstein
{Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1968}, pp. 45-69,
republished in ^Dante's Italy and Other Essays~ {Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984}], takes that nostalgic American
phrase and recasts it in Italian so that some American readers wrongly
assume, as Davis was pleased to recount in informal conversation, that
it is in fact found in the poem) in Florence, see Claire Honess
("Feminine Virtues and Florentine Vices: Citizenship and Morality in
^Paradiso~ XV-XVII," in ^Dante and Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1997], esp. pp. 108-14).

	|88-89.~  Cacciaguida's presentation of a genealogical "tree"
(Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 88-90] point to the presence of the image
of the family tree in ^Purg~. VII.121, ^Purg~. XX.43, and ^Par~. IX.31)
of Dante's family, of which he declares himself the root, begins his
wider exploration of the history of Florence, the subject of some forty
verses (88-129).  Beginning with Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 88-90), there
has been appreciation of the fact that Cacciaguida's words remember
those attributed to God the Father (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke
3:22): "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."  Schnapp
("'S@i p,ia l'ombra d'Anchise si porse': ^Paradiso~ 15.25," in Rachel
Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil
and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press,
1991], p. 150) argues for a reflection of Anchises' greeting of Aeneas
in these verses (^Aen~. VI.687-688).

	|91-94.~  Cacciaguida refers to his son Alighiero (Dante's
great-grandfather) as the source of the poet's surname (since
Alighiero's own son, Dante's grandfather, was known as Bellincione
degli Alighieri).  Alighiero was perhaps given a Christian name
reflecting his mother's maiden name, Alaghieri (see the note to vv.
137-138).  We know from documentary evidence that he was alive in 1201,
which means that Dante was misinformed as to the date of his death,
since the poet has Cacciaguida represent him as having spent more than
one hundred years in Purgatory purging his pridefulness (there results
a certain family resemblance [see ^Purg~. XIII.136-138]) and the
calendar in the poem stands at 1300.

	|95-96.~  The news of Alighiero's presence on the terrace of Pride
comes with an admonition of Dante's family duty, to pray for the
deliverance of his soul from torment.  There is a parallel moment in
^Inferno~ (^Inf~. XXIX.18-36), Dante's discovery of his ancestor, Geri
del Bello, a cousin of his father, among the sowers of discord, an
apparition that causes him to feel guilty for not having avenged a
relative's violent death.  For another similar distribution of a
family, consider the case of the Donati (Corso in Hell, Forese in
Purgatory, and Piccarda in Heaven [see the note to ^Purg~.
XXIII.42-48]; but there are several other examples as well).

See the note to ^Paradiso~ I.35-36 for the understanding that the
purpose of the poem is to affect its readers' prayers.  Here is an
internal example of precisely that effect.

	|97-99.~  "The old line of walls dated from 1078 A.D. (Villani, iv. 8);
it was now 'old,' because the wall of Dante's time was commenced in
1284....  The Badia [the church of S. Stefano in Bad@ia], the chimes of
which are here referred to, stood just within the ancient walls; the
Florentines took their time from these....  The factions and civil
dissensions in Florence did not commence until 1177" (Tozer, comm. to
this tercet).

In his commentary to these lines, Benvenuto, discussing the three
enclosing structures of walls, says that within the first one stands
the church of S. Stefano in Badia, wherefrom once came regular chimes
telling the hours, but which is now in ill repair, as he knows from
personal experience, because it was there that he listened to the
lectures on Dante's poem given by his teacher, Giovanni Boccaccio.

	|100-102.~  Dante, in Cacciaguida's voice, has harnessed his wagon of
complaint about a typical target of medieval moralizers, luxurious
living, to a misogynistic diatribe against costly female overdecoration
(for a cry against related but opposite behavior in Florentine women,
see ^Purg~. XXIII.98-105).

	|103-105.~  The tirade now turns toward marriage contracts, with their
two related ills, the lowering age at which fathers feel forced to
"sell" their daughters to a man and the rising cost of doing so,
represented by the dowry the girl's family had to put up.  The two
details manage to make the Florentine institution of marriage sound
more like sexual bondage than matrimony.

	|106.~  The line has caused difficulty.  The early commentators thought
it referred to thirteenth-century Florentine luxurious housing, the
early Renaissance equivalent of McMansions, showier houses than family
life required; later ones believed that Dante was referring to
marriages that were only for show, allowing the couple to lead
dissolute lives.  Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), reviewing the
dispute, sides with the older view, because it better accords with the
context, which is unnecessary luxury, as the following two lines
demonstrate.

	|107-108.~  "Sardanapalus, last legendary king of the Assyrian empire
of Ninus, noted for his luxury, licentiousness, and effeminacy.  He
spent his days in his palace, unseen by any of his subjects, dressed in
female apparel, and surrounded by concubines.  The satrap of Media,
having determined to renounce allegiance to such a worthless monarch,
rebelled against him, and for two years besieged him in Nineveh, until
Sardanapalus, unable to hold out any longer, collected all his
treasures, wives, and concubines, and placed them on an immense funeral
pile, to which he set fire destroying himself at the same time"
(Toynbee, "Sardanapolo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  The identity of
Dante's source here is debated; those most commonly proposed are
Juvenal (^Sat~. X.362), Cicero (^Tuscul~. V), Justinus (^Hist~. I.3),
Orosius (^Hist. contra paganos~ I.xix.1), and Aegidius Colonna (^De
regimine principum~ II.xvii), this last favored by Toynbee (in the
entry from which the opening passage is cited) because it specifically
refers to Sardanapalus's nefariously luxurious activity as being
confined to a single room.  For discussion of the likely sources of
Dante's Sardanapalus, see Brugnoli ("Sardanapalo in camera," ^Rivista
internazionale di onomastica letteraria~ 1 [1999]: 55-76).

For a specifically scabrous interpretation of Sardanapalus's nefarious
sexual activity, see Massimiliano Chiamenti ("Pietro Alighieri e il
lessico della ^Commedia~," in ^The Dante Commentary Tradition: Critical
Discourse in the Making~, ed. Paola Nasti. [Oxford: Legenda, 2007 {in
process}]), arguing that this passage backs up to that in I^nferno~
XVI.45 (and see the note to ^Inf~. XVI.28-42); it is his view that
Florence is in Dante's day deprived of children because the citizens of
the city had begun to practice birth-control by limiting themselves to
anal intercourse.  However, this view overrides the larger sense of
effeminate living that Dante was likely to have been upset about.

	|109-111.~  The thought here is that Florence after Cacciaguida's day
rapidly eclipsed Rome in urban splendor, but its fall from supremacy
will be even more swift.  In synecdoche, Monte Mario and Uccellatoio
represent Rome and Florence respectively.  Explaining these lines,
Carroll has this to say (comm. to vv. 97-120): "Montemalo (now Monte
Mario) is the hill on the way from Viterbo from which the splendour of
the Eternal City is first seen; and Uccellatoio is the point on the
road from Bologna from which the first flash of the greater splendour
of Florence breaks on the traveller's view."

	|112-113.~  Bellincion Berti is exemplary of the citizenry of "the good
old days" of Florence.  Giovanni Villani (^Cronica~ IV.1) speaks of him
in similar terms.  He was father of the "good Gualdrada" of ^Inferno~
XVI.37.  While males, with the exception of the effeminate Sardanapalus
and the corrupt Lapo (see verse 128), are not used to exemplify
improper municipal behavior, they surely are present in the rest of the
canto as representatives of Florentine virtue.

	|114.~  A good woman, as we would expect in this context, eschews
facial cosmetics.

	|115-117.~  The heads of noble Florentine families (the Nerli and the
Vecchietti) are, like Bellincion Berti, content with simple clothing,
without adornment; their wives exhibit their virtue by what they take
pleasure in doing: household chores.

	|118-120.~  Two different sorts of ills befalling Florentine wives are
referred to here: Some were taken along by their husbands when they
were exiled and eventually died in foreign lands; others, married to
men who took themselves off to a life of trade in France (cf. the first
story in Boccaccio's ^Decameron~), led lonely lives at home.

	|121-123.~  This vignette from "Scenes from Florentine Family Life, ca.
1125," by Dante Alighieri, features babytalk (see Hollander ["Babytalk
in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ {Ravenna: Longo, 1980},
p. 127]), a phenomenon that Dante is (perhaps surprisingly) most
interested in.  Florentine babies, goo-gooing in their cribs, are
represented as teaching their mommies (and daddies, too) to speak in
that "idiom."  That word, which first appears here and then will be
used only once more in the poem (^Par~. XXVI.114), where it is used to
delineate Adam's first speech, is unmistakably "vernacular" Hebrew (or,
perhaps more accurately, pre-Hebrew).  And thus the word ^id,ioma~,
here, may offer an insight into Dante's theory of the history of
language: Each infant recapitulates the primal linguistic moment,
speaking a version of Adamic vernacular, until, in the push and pull of
maternal and paternal instruction and the infant's response, that
vernacular takes on a local flavor, in this case Florentine.  See
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 121-126): "scilicet, maternum linguagium,
scilicet, ^la ninna nanna~."  Vellutello regularly uses the word
^idioma~ to refer to various Italian vernaculars.  See his commentary
to ^Inf~. IX.78 (Florentine), ^Inf~. XII.91-99 and ^Inf~. XIV.28-30
(Lombard), ^Inf~. XX.130 (Tuscan), ^Inf~. XXVI.70-75 (Latin), ^Inf~.
XXVII.16-21 (Lombard), ^Inf~. XXVIII.70-72 (Latin), ^Inf~.
XXXI.109-111, ^Purg~. IV.67-72, and ^Purg~. XXIV.61-63 (Florentine),
^Purg~. XXVI.139-148 (Proven$cal).

	|124.~  A second female presence is probably the husband's mother, also
doing useful chores, working at her loom.

	|125-126.~  This grandmother narrates for the children in the family
(but heard by all) the pre-history of Florence, with its roots in Troy,
Rome, and Fiesole.  Torraca (comm. to vv. 121-126) explains the
details, common to many chronicles of the time, as follows: "The
Florentines told of the origins of their city in the following way.
After the linguistic division made as a result of the attempt to
construct the tower of Babel, Atlas built the first city, which thus
^fu sola~ [stood alone] and was therefore called Fiesole.  Another of
Atlas's sons, Dardanus, traveling in the East, built Troy there.  From
Troy Aeneas came to Italy.  One of his descendants founded Rome.  The
Romans destroyed Fiesole.  Romans and Fiesolans founded Florence."

	|127-129.~  Dante alludes to two of his Florentine contemporaries,
first Cianghella, daughter of Arrigo della Tosa.  She married a man
from Imola, after whose death she returned to her birthplace and
behaved in such fashion as customarily gave widows a very bad name (cf.
Boccaccio's ^Corbaccio~), leading a life marked by lust and luxury.
The profile of Lapo Salterello sounds a good bit like that of Dante (to
what must have been the poet's dismay).  He was a jurist and poet who,
in 1294, represented his city to the papacy, and was then elected prior
of Florence; further, in 1300 he denounced several of his townsmen for
collaborating with Pope Boniface VIII; in 1302 he, like Dante, was sent
into exile (for fomenting discord and for barratry) by the victorious
Black Guelphs.  In chiastic order, Cianghella and Lapo are compared
with two virtuous figures from the era of the Roman republic,
Cincinnatus and Cornelia (see ^Inf~. IV.128), the mother of the
Gracchi.  For Dante's overwhelming admiration of the Romans of those
days, see Hollander and Rossi ("Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante
Studies~ 104 [1986]: 59-82).  And for a revisionist (and convincing)
analysis of the republican roots of Dante's imperialist views, see
Peter Armour ("Dante and Popular Sovereignty," in ^Dante and
Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse [Oxford: Clarendon, 1997], pp. 27-45).

	|129.~  See Diana Glenn ("Women in Limbo: Arbitrary Listings or Textual
Referents?  Mapping the Connections in ^Inferno~ IV and ^Purgatorio~
XXII," ^Dante Studies~ 117 [1999]: 112) on Cornelia's presence in
^Inferno~ IV.

	|130-148.~  Cacciaguida's self-narrative, the longest in ^Paradiso~,
nonetheless seems brief when compared to some of the epic
autobiographical performances of characters in ^Inferno~, e.g., Ulysses
(53 lines), Ugolino (72 lines).  (The very length of their utterances
should have warned Romantic readers to regard them with more skepticism
than they apparently desired to bring to them.)  For discussion of the
nature of speeches in ^Paradiso~, see the fourth section of the
Introduction.

For a global study of these three canti dedicated to Dante's ancestor,
see Fernando Figurelli ("I canti di Cacciaguida," ^Cultura e scuola~ 4
[1965]: 634-61).

	|130-132.~  This ^terzina~ repeats a theme that we have encountered
before (the "good old days"), but does so with such emphasis and
fluidity (both lines are enjambed, so that the entire tercet has the
feeling of a single line of thought, with four iterations of the adverb
^cos@i~ upping the emotional effect), as to leave us in suspense,
wondering about the subject and predicate that it introduces.

Dante's radical notion of the responsibility of the citizen, based on
ethics more than on politics, may have been shaped by the "radical
corporationalism" of Remigio dei Girolami; the characterization is that
of Ernst Kantorowicz (^The King's Two Bodies~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1957], p. 478), cited by Claire Honess ("Feminine
Virtues and Florentine Vices: Citizenship and Morality in ^Paradiso~
XV-XVII," in ^Dante and Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse [Oxford:
Clarendon, 1997], p. 104).  For an overview of the still
under-investigated question of Remigio's possible influence on Dante,
with bibliography (including three important essays in English by
Charles Till Davis), see Ovidio Capitani, "Girolami, Remigio dei," ^ED~
III (1971).

	|133-135.~  The first three words of the line offer subject, verb, and
object: "Mary gave me."  The tercet is based on the moments of birth
and baptism, the crusader's mother calling out for the aid of Mary in
the pain of parturition, and the ceremonial pronouncing of the child's
name at his baptism (in the Florentine Baptistry, where Dante himself
would also receive his Christian identity and name); the last word of
the tercet, reflecting its first word, also a name (Maria), is
Cacciaguida.  (He has delayed Dante's gratification for some time now;
Dante asked to know who he was at verse 87.)

	|136.~  Cacciaguida now names his brothers, Moronto and Eliseo, of whom
we know absolutely nothing.  There has been some dispute over the years
about the exact content of the line and some speculation that Dante
means to associate himself with the great Florentine Ghibelline family,
the Elisei, with no convincing result to the process.

	|137-138.~  Cacciaguida's wife came, he says, from the valley of the Po
(over the years, Ferrara remains perhaps the favorite location among
the discussants, but, since there is a lot at stake [as, for some
Americans, there is with regard to George Washington's dining and
sleeping habits], the debate goes on).  It was from her, he continues,
that Dante got his surname, Alaghieri or Alighieri.  Since one of her
and Cacciaguida's sons was named Alighiero, it seems more than likely
that he was named for his mother.

	|139-144.~  He follows the emperor, Conrad III, on the (disastrous)
Second Crusade (in 1147) against Islam, against which the popes even
now in Dante's day fail to take up arms (not even ^preaching~ crusade,
much less fighting one).  There still remains some debate over the
question of which emperor Dante really means, Conrad II or III.  But
see Carroll (comm. to vv. 130-148): "Some doubt has been thrown on the
commonly accepted view that the Emperor whom Cacciaguida followed to
the Crusades was Conrad III of Suabia, but without reason.  Founding on
a passage in Villani (IV.9), Cassini suggests Conrad II, the Salic, who
was Emperor from 1024 to 1039.  According to Villani, this Emperor
(whom he calls Conrad I and misdates) visited Florence frequently and
knighted many of its citizens.  The only crusade he undertook was
against the Saracens in Calabria, so that on this view Cacciaguida
never was in the Holy Land, and his birth must be pushed back at least
a century before the generally received time.  It is obviously
impossible that he could in that case be the father of the Alighiero
whom he calls his son, who died more than a hundred and sixty years
later.  There is no reason for giving up the ordinary view that the
Emperor referred to is Conrad III, who in 1147, with Louis VII of
France, undertook the disastrous Second Crusade, so enthusiastically
preached by St. Bernard of Clairvaux.  (Bernard's defense for the
failure of this Crusade which roused all Europe against him is that it
was due to the sins of the Crusaders themselves.  They fell as the
Israelites fell in the wilderness, and from the same cause.  His remedy
is -- faith and a third Crusade [^De Consideratione~, II.1]".)

	|145-148.~  He died in the Holy Land and came from martyrdom to this
peace (cf. the words for Boethius' similar journey [^Par~. X.128-29]).
While some twentieth-century commentators seem to be open to the idea,
no one before Chimenz (comm. to vv. 145-148) states clearly that the
text surely accommodates the view of medieval clergy that those who
died on crusade in the Holy Land went straight to Heaven, bypassing
Purgatory.
