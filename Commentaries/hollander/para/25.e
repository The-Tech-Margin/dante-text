	|1-9.~  This passage is surely one of the most personal statements
Dante makes in the entire poem.  However, it tends to cause
disagreement, the central issue of which is whether Dante presents
himself as vigorous in his hope for laureation or as sardonic about its
likelihood.  As representative of the first school of thought, which
has its roots in Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 1) and, more
vociferously, in the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 1-12), one might choose the
recent treatment of John Scott (^Understanding Dante~ [Notre Dame:
Notre Dame University Press, 2004]).  His "optimistic" reading, one
which it is at least apparently in keeping with Dante's "hopefulness,"
the subject, after all, on which he is being examined by St. James) is
found both in Scott's translation and in his paraphrase of these lines.
 In the first, he supplies the following (the square brackets are in
his text): "If it comes [and may it come] to pass that the sacred poem
to which both heaven and earth have lent a hand..." (p. 98); in the
second, he offers his eventual sense of the passage, intrinsically
denying to Dante a proper Christian sense of the contingency of all
earthly things.  Scott considers the two subjunctives in vv. 1 and 4
optative (as do others, including Edoardo Fumagalli ["Canto XXV," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone {Florence: Cesati, 2002}, p. 393], who goes on to
remind us that Petrocchi's punctuation of the text supports this
reading; however, as we know, it is probable that Petrocchi's
interpretation dictated his choice of punctuation), expressing "what
the exiled poet longs for with all his being, a burning desire that
opens the canto dedicated to the theological value of hope" (p. 395).

On the other hand, see, among others, Gian Roberto Sarolli
(^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp.
384-89), Marguerite Mills Chiarenza ("Time and Eternity in the Myths of
^Paradiso~ XVII," in ^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in the
Italian Trecento in Honor of Charles S. Singleton~, ed. A. S. Bernardo
and A. L. Pellegrini [Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and
Studies, 1983], pp. 147-48) and Anna Chiavacci Leonardi ("'Le bianche
stole': il tema della resurrezione nel ^Paradiso~," in ^Dante e la
Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki, 1988], p. 268) for
appreciations of the ^contingent~ nature of Dante's hope for laureation
in Florence, which they find in the passage.  Such an attitude is
typified by a resigned tone rather than the hopeful one that most
readers, like Scott, assign to him.  A playful paraphrase in tune with
this second view of the passage might run as follows: "Should it ever
fall out [even if it seems most unlikely to do so] that I return to
Florence [but those bastards will ^never~ allow me to come back home]
and then [perhaps equally implausibly] that those fools decide to give
me the laurel [which Giovanni del Virgilio has already offered me if I
write a Latin poem for those sharing his dreadful Bolognese taste in
poetry]...."  In such a view, where the first two verbs are
circumspectly (and correctly) dubious, and thus in the subjunctive
mood, the last two are triumphantly (and illogically) indicative ("I
shall return," "I shall take").  (The subjunctive in a dependent clause
almost necessarily causes a reader or a listener to expect the
conditional ["I would return," "I would take"].  Human behavior being
what it is, however, one must admit that practice in this regard is
various.  See Franca Brambilla Ageno, "Congiuntivo" and "'Consecutio
temporis" in ^ED~ VI [1978], pp. 233-61 and 426-38.)  Indeed, in one
sense Dante already has crowned himself (he allows St. Peter to be the
agent of his heavenly "laureation" at the conclusion of Canto XXIV, an
"event" he refers to in verse 12.)  In this reading, the desired but
improbable hometown laureation is represented as being both totally
unlikely and as inescapable, were the world (and particularly Florence)
only honest; thus the truculently aggressive tone of the indicatives.
To summarize, to those of this persuasion, Dante seems to be saying,
"Well, I do not think it is really likely to occur but, if I do make it
back home, I'm going to take the laurel (since I deserve it and since
no one else is going to give it to me)."  It is notable that Dante, on
both occasions on which he considers the prospect of his own laureation
(see ^Par~. I.26, ^coronarmi~ [crown myself]), imagines the wreath, not
as being bestowed upon him by some benevolent figure, but as being
taken by himself.  (For this appreciation, see Mattalia [comm. to verse
9].)

Scott (p. 296) observes that the ^vello~ (fleece) in verse 7 aligns
Dante, as well as with Jason, with the biblical prophet John the
Baptist, that patron of Florence and figure celebrated by its
Baptistry, who wore camel skins as his garment in the wilderness, his
fleece.  For the only slightly more widely recognized reference here,
to Jason's search for the Golden Fleece, see Gian Roberto Sarolli
(^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], p.
401) and Marie Catherine Pohndorf ("Conceptual Imagery Related to the
Journey Theme in Dante's ^Commedia~" [Doctoral dissertation, University
of Denver, 1965], p. 189), the latter in particular supported by
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969]), pp. 223-24.  (It is a perhaps surprising fact
that no commentator in the current version of the DDP seems to have
associated this ^vello~ with Jason, although their connection here
seems obvious.)

	|1-6.~  The rhyme words in vv. 2, 4, and 6 had appeared in the ^envoi~
of the canzone known as "La montanina" (^Rime~ CXVI.76-84).  According
to Scott (^Understanding Dante~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University
Press, 2004], p. 97), this conscious visitation of the past (the
"mountain song" is thought to have been composed ca. 1307), of the
sadness of his exile, is put forward here in a bittersweet mood.  For
Dante's letter to Moroello Malaspina accompanying the poem, see Emilio
Pasquini ("Il ^Paradiso~ e una nuova idea di figuralismo,"
^Intersezioni~ 16 [1996], p. 427).

	|1.~  We may do well to remember the offer made to Dante by Giovanni
del Virgilio, that he should follow his vernacular ^Commedia~ with a
more worthy instrument of procuring the laurel (see the note to ^Par~.
XV.28-30), a Latin poem with a political subject.  If the hypothesis
shared by John Carroll and Lino Pertile is correct (see the note to
^Par~. XXIII.130-132), Dante composed his answering eclogue soon after
he was writing that canto.  It is inviting to think that this
insistence on his poem's being, on the contrary, dedicated to sacred
things, is a defiant answer to that invitation, even if that may
stretch chronological possibilities a bit much.  However, for Dante's
sense of a recent (1315) Italian laureation and its impact on him, see
the note to ^Paradiso~ IX.29-30.  And see Hollander ("Dante's Pride,"
in ^Studi sul canone letterario del Trecento: Per Michelangelo Picone~,
a cura di J. Bartuschat and L. Rossi [Ravenna: Longo, 2003], pp. 54-55)
for the poet's handling of the temptations of fame.

Claudia Villa ("^Comoedia: laus in canticis dicta?~  Schede per Dante:
^Paradiso~, XXV.1 e ^Inferno~, XVIII," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1
[2001]: 325-31) considers both the term ^poema sacro~ and the related
phrase "sacrato poema" at ^Paradiso~ XXIII.62.

This is the only presence in the poem of the verb ^contingere~.  For
the occurrences of the noun ^contingenza~ (^Par~. XIII.63; XIII.64;
XVII.37) and the participial adjective ^contingente~ (^Par~. XIII.99;
XVII.16), see the entries for those terms, both prepared by Alfonso
Maier@u, ^ED~ II (1970).

	|2.~  In response to this challenging verse, Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e
le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno
Mondadori, 2001], pp. 145, 147) moves away from the traditional
exegesis, which has it that the words ^cielo~ and ^terra~ both refer to
what God has created, the twin subject of the poem, as it were, heaven
and earth.  That is, he realizes that the verse is not about the
subject of the poem but about its heavenly agency.  However, while an
improvement in one respect, his reading seems deficient in the main
one.  For what may seem a radical (but perhaps only a necessary) view
of the matter, see Hollander ("'Al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra'
[^Paradiso~ 25.2]," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of
America~ [January 1997]) and, for a similar view, Baranski ("Canto
XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001], pp. 393-94).  Such a
reading of this line has it that Dante insists, however covertly, that
the poem has two makers, God (the divine "dictator") and himself (the
human "scribe").  The notion that he thus portrays his own hand writing
the poem finds support in ^Rime~ CXIV.8, Dante's answer to a sonnet
from Cino da Pistoia, in which he portrays his tired fingers grasping
the pen with which he writes his own responsive sonnet.  Recently (25
Feb. 2006) John Scott was kind enough to call the present writer's
attention to the following relevant passage from an encyclopedist whose
work Dante nearly certainly knew.  His self-presentation is remarkably
similar to what is here being proposed as Dante's in this tercet: "Si
quis querat huius operis quis autor, dicendum est quia Deus; si querat
huius operis quis fuerit instrumentum, respondendum est quia patria
pisanus, nomine Uguitio quasi eugetio, idest bona terra [...].  Igitur
Sancti Spiritus assistente gratia, ut qui est omnium bonorum
distributor nobis verborum copiam auctim suppeditare dignetur, a verbo
augmenti nostre assertionis auspicium sortiamur" (Uguccione da Pisa,
^Derivationes~, ed. Enzo Cecchini and others [Florence: SISMEL -
Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2004], vol. II, p. 4).

	|3.~  For the sense of this verse, Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-9) looks
back to the ^fami, freddi o vigilie~ that Dante claims to have suffered
on behalf of his poem.  See ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.37-38: "O sacred Virgins,
if fasting, cold, or sleepless nights / I've ever suffered for your
sake...."

	|4.~  For ^fuor mi serra~ (locks me out), see the envoy of ^Rime~ CXVI,
the so-called "Montanina": "My mountain song, go your way.  Perhaps you
will see Florence, my city, that shuts me out from her ^[che fuor di
s@e mi serra]~, void of love and stripped of compassion" (tr. Foster
and Boyde).  The self-citation was first noted by Tommaseo (comm. to
vv. 4-6).

And see Giuseppe Velli ("Petrarca, Dante, la poesia classica: 'Ne la
stagion che'l ciel rapido inchina' [^RVF~, L] 'Io son venuto al punto
de la rota' (^Rime~, C)," ^Studi petrarcheschi~ 15 [2002.1]: 88), first
demonstrating a clear dependency of elements in ^Rime~ C, "Io son
venuto," very likely the first among the ^rime petrose~ to be composed,
on Ovid's ^Tristia~, and then, p. 92, for the curious relationship
among Virgil (^Georgics~ III.365), several lines of Ovid's in the
^Tristia~ and ^ex Ponto~, "Io son venuto" (^Rime~ C.60-61), ^Inf~.
XXXIII.22, and this verse.

	|5-6.~  The figurative speech is oversimplified and dramatic: Florence
as "sheepfold," youthful Dante as "lamb," his enemies (Black Guelphs,
others) as "wolves."

	|7.~   ^altra voce... altro vello~: lit., deeper voice and facial hair
or gray hair (see Dante, ^Eclogue~ I.42-44) of the mature man;
metaphorically, with prophetic speech and this book, written on
^vellum~ (?); in addition, new "golden fleece" (see Ovid, ^Metam~.
VI.720: "vellera," and Dante, in his first ^Eclogue~ [II.1]:
"Velleribus Colchis" [Colchian fleece]) -- Dante as Jason (cf. ^Par~.
II.16-18; XXXIII.94-96).

See Giuseppe Velli ("Dante e la memoria della poesia classica," ^Annali
della Facolt@a di lettere e di filosofia della Universit@a di Macerata~
22-23 [1989-90], pp. 36-38) for the possible echo in Dante's ^voce~ and
^vello~ of Statius's use of these two words in ^Thebaid~ II.96.

	|7-9.~  Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) was perhaps the first to point
to a passage in Dante's first ^Eclogue~, which is addressed to Giovanni
del Virgilio, who had made a conditional invitation that he come to
Bologna to receive the poet's crown there.  In that poem Dante says
(vv. 42-44): "Nonne triumphales melius pexare capillos, / et, patrio
redeam si quando, abscondere canos / fronde sub inserta solitum
flavescere, Sarno?" (Were it not better my triumphant locks should hide
beneath the green their hoariness, erst auburn-glowing, by the
ancestral stream, should ever I return to deck them there, of Arno?
[tr. Wicksteed and Gardner]).  It seems evident that either this
passage is reflected in that one -- unless, as seems less likely, this
one was written after that one.  In any case, it seems clear that Dante
was much involved with thoughts reflecting both Mussato's laureation in
1315 and his own desire for that reward, whether before Giovanni's
goading offer or after it.  See the note to verse 1.

	|8-9.~  "in sul fonte... battesimo": John Scott, in an e-mail in 2005,
points to an observation made by Augustine Thompson (^Cities of God:
The Religion of the Italian Communes 1125-1325~ [Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005], pp. 26-27: "Baptism, above all
else, identified the first church of the city.  For thirteenth-century
Italians, too, the religious heart of the commune was not the cathedral
but the baptistery. [...] Until the mid-1900s, all Florentines received
baptism [there]."

	|8.~  In this use of the word ^poeta~, we have the closest Dante ever
comes to calling himself "poet" outright, though he has been issuing
statements that all but said as much as early as ^Vita nuova~ XXV.  No
vernacular writer of lyric had ever used this term for himself before;
it is traditionally reserved for the classical (Latin and Greek) poets.

	|9.~  Exactly what Dante means by this word has been a matter of some
dispute.  See Paola Rigo (^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in Dante~
[Florence: Olschki, 1994]), pp. 135-63) for a complex meditation on
possible meanings of the poet's putting on the ^cappello~ ("crown,"
according to her, in the sense of "reward for accomplishment in
poetry"), in which she advances the theory that it refers most
significantly to Dante's desire to be given back his Florentine
citizenship.  Edoardo Fumagalli ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 395-96) resuscitates Francesco Novati's
study of this passage ("La suprema aspirazione di Dante," in his
^Indagini e postille dantesche.  Serie prima~ [Bologna: Zanichelli,
1899], pp. 73-113).  Novati had argued that Dante could not have hoped
to be granted the laurel for a poem written in the vernacular, citing
Mussato's Paduan coronation in 1315 for a ^Latin~ work that was deemed
appropriate for such reward, while Dante must have realized that his
vernacular poem would not be (a very weak argument, one wants to add).
What he really wanted, Novati continued, was an "advanced degree" from
the as yet unfounded Florentine university.  Apparently, Novati has a
precursor down this errant path.  Scartazzini (comm. to this verse)
cites from G. Todeschini at some length and to the same effect (Dante
longed to be "Professor Alighieri") before canceling his ticket.

For an earlier self-laureation, see Horace, ^Odes~ (III.30: "Exegi
monumentum aere perennius," which, the last poem in the third book of
the collection, ends (vv. 14-16) with "Sume superbiam / quaesitam
meritis et mihi Delphica / lauro cinge uolens, Melpomene, comam.  The
word ^cappello~ is now generally acknowledged to derive from OF
^chaplet~, "garland"; cf. ^Decameron~ I.i, the name of the scandalous
protagonist Cepparello transmogrified by the Burgundians into
Ciappelletto, from ^chaplet~.  Whatever one may eventually decide
^cappello~ may mean, one will probably not admire or accept Giuseppe
Mazzotta's phrasing: "poetic hat" ("Dante and the Virtues of Exile,"
^Poetics Today~ 5 [1984], p. 645).

Kevin Brownlee ("Why the Angels Speak Italian: Dante as Vernacular
^Poeta~ in ^Paradiso~ XXV," ^Poetics Today~ 5 [1984]: 597-610) finds a
pattern of authorial strategy in the ^Commedia~ marked by an increasing
use of the vernacular in religious contexts, in order to endow Italian
with the authority to stand beside Latin for serious purposes and,
along with this, an exaltation of Dante's status to that of ^poeta~.
Brownlee argues that this concern first surfaces in ^Vita Nuova~ XXV,
then in ^Inferno~ XXV, in ^Purgatorio~ XXV, and culminates here in
^Paradiso~ XXV.

	|10-12.~  Whatever we make of the first nine verses (e.g., do they
present Dante's hunger for a not truly Christian poetic immortality or
his shrugging it off?), this tercet says the "right" things about the
"right" kind of immortality.  He wants to be "crowned" in the Baptistry
because it was there he entered the Catholic faith.  His belief in
Jesus Christ has just now (^Par~. XXIV.152) been celebrated when his
temples were thrice circled by St. Peter, named for the first time
since his appearance in the last lines of Canto XXIII.

	|13-15.~  While James is never named, he is clearly identified (the
same will be true of John at the end of this canto and in XXVI).

The ^spera~ (circle) referred to is surely that most precious one among
those making up the Church Triumphant (see ^Par~. XXIV.13-18 and note),
the one containing at least some of the apostles.  For ^primizie~
(first-fruits), see James 1:18: "Of his own will he brought us forth by
the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
creatures."  James is speaking of all the apostles; here Dante uses his
word in the singular to refer to Peter alone.

	|17.~  For the term ^barone~, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXIV.115.

	|18.~  "St. James, to whose tomb at Compostella, in Galicia [Spain],
pilgrimages were and are still made.  The legend says that the body of
St. James was put on board a ship and abandoned to the sea; but the
ship, being guided by an angel, landed safely in Galicia.  There the
body was buried; but in the course of time the place of its burial was
forgotten, and not discovered again till the year 800, when it was
miraculously revealed to a friar" (Longfellow, comm. to verse 17).
Compostella, after Rome, was the most popular goal of pilgrims inside
Europe's borders.  See Dante's divisions of pilgrims into three groups
in ^Vita nuova~ XL.7: "palmers" (to the Holy Land), "pilgrims" (to
Galicia), "romers" (to Rome).

What was Dante's knowledge of the distinctions between the two saints
named James?  Historians distinguish between James the Major (son of
Zebedee) and James the Minor (son of Alpheus).  For the undeveloped
claim (and death has deprived us of such development) that Dante here
deliberately conflates the two James, see Karl Uitti ("The ^Codex
Calixtinus~ and the European St. James the Major: Some Contextual
Issues," in ^"De sens rassis": Essays in Honor of Rupert T. Pickens~,
ed. Keith Busby ^et al~. [Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2005], p. 650n.).

	|19-24.~  See R.A. Shoaf ("Dante's ^colombi~ and the Figuralism of Hope
in the ^Divine Comedy~," ^Dante Studies~ 93 [1975]: 27-59), who argues
for the presence of a "dove program" in the poem, moving from the
damned sinners Francesca and Paolo in ^Inferno~ V.82, through the
muddled saved souls on the shore, unable to distinguish between wheat
and tares in ^Purgatorio~ II.125, to these brotherly apostles,
redeeming earthly affection by turning it toward heavenly nourishment
(see ^Par~. XXIV.1-2, "the elect invited to / the glorious supper of
the bless@ed Lamb"), thus tacitly rebuking the careless eating habits
of the freshly saved souls on the shore of Purgatory.  There are only
these three presences of doves in the poem, each in a carefully turned
simile, one to a canticle; it is difficult to believe Dante was ^not~
paying close attention to their distribution and significance.

	|26.~  The reader has once before encountered the first word of the
Latin phrase ^coram me~ (in front of me): See ^Paradiso~ XI.63: ^coram
patre~, when, "in the presence of his father," Francis "married" Lady
Poverty.

	|28-33.~  Tozer (comm. to vv. 29-30) says that the passages in St.
James's epistle that are referred to are 1:5, "If any of you lacks
wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach,
and it will be given him"; 1:17, "Every good gift and every perfect
gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights"; other
commentators add 2:5, "Has not God chosen those who are poor in the
world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom?"  Tozer continues,
"It is to be remarked that Dante has here and in vv. 76-77, by a
strange error, attributed this epistle, which was written by St. James
the Less, to St. James the Greater; the same mistake is found in
Brunetto Latini (^Tesoro~, Bk. II, Ch. 8)."  For the favor of Jesus,
Grandgent (comm. to vv. 32-33) offers the following: "Three of the
disciples (Peter, James, John) were chosen by Jesus to be present, and
to receive the clearest revelation of his character, on three different
occasions: at the Transfiguration (Matth. 17:1-8), in the Garden of
Gethsemane (Matth. 26:36-38), and at the raising of the daughter of
Jairus (Luke 8:50-56).  On these three occasions Peter, James, and John
stand respectively for Faith, Hope, and Love."

	|30.~  The Greek word "basilica" is defined by Jacopo della Lana (comm.
to vv. 29-30) as ^Domus regia~ (royal palace).  Benvenuto (comm. to vv.
28-30) says that Beatrice is referring to the Church Triumphant (in the
Empyrean, if it is now present here).

	|32.~  For James as the "figure" of Hope in the technical sense (i.e.,
he is said to "figure" it), see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 64-66).
For his more general association with hope, see Achille Tartaro ("Il
Canto XXV," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro
[Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 680), referring to the earlier arguments of
Davide Conrieri ("San Giacomo e la speranza: osservazioni su ^Paradiso~
XXV, vv. 13-99," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 148
[1971]: 309-15) and Lucia Battaglia Ricci ("^Paradiso~ XXV, 86-96,"
^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 149 [1972]: 333-38).

	|37.~  James, lending his presence to that of Peter, is the one who
speaks.

	|38-39.~  The plain meaning of this circumlocution is that, at the
invitation of James, Dante looked up at both apostles, since he had at
first lowered his gaze in respect.  See Psalm 120:1: "Levavi oculos
meos in montes, unde veniet auxilium mihi" (I have lifted up my eyes to
the hills, whence shall come my help).

	|40-45.~  One might paraphrase the apostle's words as follows: "Since
the Emperor, in his grace, wants you to see his counts in his most
secret hall while you still live so that, experiencing the truth of
this court, you may make yourself stronger in Hope -- and others, too."
 For the language of worldly titles, used of the members of the "court"
of Heaven, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXIV.115.

	|46-48.~  James asks the protagonist three questions: (1) "What is
Hope?" (2) "How does your mind blossom with it?" (3) "From where did it
make its way to you?"

	|49-51.~  In the poet's barely suppressed reference to Daedalus,
Beatrice is portrayed as having done well in guiding Dante's pens/wings
to such lofty flight.  She now intervenes for him, answering James's
second question -- perhaps because it would have been awkward for Dante
to have responded, since his answer might have seemed self-praising.

	|52-57.~  Giuseppe Mazzotta ("Teologia ed esegesi biblica [^Par~.
III-V]," in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki,
1988], p. 98) sees this passage as confirming the pattern of Exodus as
a model for the poem, as has already been made explicit in ^Purgatorio~
II.46.  It also contains two (of only three) uses of the verb
^militare~ in the poem.  We are dealing here with an armed exodus, a
Christian militancy.  The other text, ^Paradiso~ XII.35, refers to the
conjoined militancy of Dominic and Francis.

Beatrice presents Dante's claims to the theological virtue of Hope.
Inscribed in Christ, he has been chosen to come from "Egypt" to
"Jerusalem" and to this vision before he finishes his militancy
(Daniello [comm. to vv. 55-57] was apparently the first commentator to
cite Job 7:1 in this connection: "Militia est vita hominis super
terram" [Man's life on this earth is a warfare]; Lombardi [comm. to
verse 57] and Scartazzini [comm. to verse 57] also cite these words.
It has since become fairly commonplace to do so).

	|58-63.~  Beatrice continues: As for the first and third questions,
which you put to him not to know the answer but so that he may please
you in his responses (cf. ^Par.~ XXIV.40-45), and which will not be
difficult for him, let him reply.

	|67-69.~  See Singleton (comm. to this tercet): "The definition of hope
given by Dante here is that of Peter Lombard in ^Sentences~ III.xxvi.1:
'Est enim spes certa expectatio futurae beatitudinis, veniens ex Dei
gratia et meritis praecedentibus' (Now hope is a certain expectation of
future beatitude proceeding from God's grace and antecedent merits).
He adds: 'Sine meritis aliquid sperare non spes sed praesumptio dici
potest' (Without merits, to hope for something is not hope but
presumption)."

	|70-78.~  See Psalm 9:11: "And those who know your name shall put their
trust in you ^[sperent in te]~)."  The protagonist credits David with
being the first who had instilled hope in his heart, and then James
(James 1:12) instilled it there, too, so that Dante is filled with it
and "rerains" both of these "rains" on others.

	|73-78.~  William Stephany ("^Paradiso~ XXV," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 377-78) invites a closer examination
of these two tercets, which reveal, first, hidden in the words
describing David's ^t,eodia~, Augustine's association of the name of
God and hope; second, in the very words of the Epistle of James (see
the note to ^Inf~. XXVI.32 for the presence of James 3:4-6 behind that
tercet), the imperative to be a maker of words producing a love for
God, an imperative fulfilled by Dante's ^t,eodia~ as well.

	|73.~  See Michel David ("Dante et sa th$eodie," in ^Omaggio a
Gianfranco Folena~, ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale
Programma, 1993]), pp. 441-44) on ^t,eodia~ as a "chant provenant de
Dieu" (song deriving from God) and as being, ^sub rosa~, a generic
denominator of the poem.  But see Teodolinda Barolini's earlier (and
fuller) exposition of this theme (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1984], pp. 276-77).

	|79-81.~  James responds to Dante's formulation with an accepting
lightning flash.

	|82-87.~  See Tozer (comm. to vv. 83-84) for a paraphrase and
explanation: "St. James is still kindled with love for the virtue of
Hope, though the Blessed can no longer feel hope themselves, because
they have fruition; ^la palma~: the palm of martyrdom, ^l'uscir del
campo~: his quitting the field of battle was his death.  St. James was
put to death by Herod Agrippa the Elder, Acts 12:1-2."

	|89-96.~  Tozer (comm. to vv. 91-93): "Isaiah 61:7: 'Therefore in their
land they shall possess the double; everlasting joy shall be unto
them.'  Dante interprets 'the double' as meaning the blessedness of
soul and body; cf. ^doppia vesta~ here with ^due stole~ in l. 127."
And see John (in Apoc. 3:5 and Apoc. 7:9-17), speaking more directly of
the general resurrection.

Stephany ("^Paradiso~ XXV," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
{virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 381) suggests that, although not cited directly in
this canto, Isaiah 61 offers an indirect gloss on it.  In Luke 4, Jesus
reads from this chapter of Isaiah in the temple; when he sees that his
words are offensive he insists that "no prophet is honored in his
native land" (Luke 4:24), words that certainly must have seemed to the
exiled poet to fit his own condition as well.

	|89.~  Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi ("'Le bianche stole': il tema
della resurrezione nel ^Paradiso~,"  in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G.
Barblan [Florence: Olschki, 1988], p. 266n.) writes that ^segno~ here
means, not ^termine a cui si tende~ or ^meta~ ("goal"), as is
supposedly the "general understanding among exegetes" of this verse,
but "sign," citing Torraca (comm. to vv. 88-90) as her precursor.
However, consultation of the full and sensible review of the problem by
Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 88-90) would have revealed an earlier,
better, and more convincing understanding of the line, taken in
precisely this sense.  Further, examination of the commentary tradition
reveals that as long ago as the early fourteenth century readers like
the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 88-89) possessed exactly such an understanding.

	|91-93.~  For a meditation upon resurrection, so clearly referred to
here, as being the central concern of the entire poem, see Chiavacci
Leonardi ("'Le bianche stole': il tema della resurrezione nel
^Paradiso~,"  in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence:
Olschki, 1988], pp. 249-71).

	|93.~  For the two previous appearances of the phrase ^dolce vita~, see
the note to ^Paradiso~ IV.35.

	|94-96.~  For the "shining robes," see Apocalypse 3:5 and 7:9-17.  And
for the concept of the glorified body, see Manuele Gragnolati
(^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press,
2005], p. 198; also pp. 165-66, discussing St. James).

	|97-99.~  Among the commentators, only Carroll (comm. to these verses)
looks up from this Latin "translation" of the vernacular version of a
line from the ninth Psalm, which we have heard in verse 73, to think of
Psalm 30, also involving hope in the Lord.  This is what he has to say:
"It is probably meant to be the reversal of the incident in the Earthly
Paradise....  There, when the Angels, pitying Dante's distress, sang
'^In te, Domine, speravi~,' they were promptly silenced by Beatrice --
he had then no title to hope.  Now everything is changed.  Beatrice
herself proclaims him a child of hope."

	|98.~  The identity of the singer(s) of the words of the Psalm is not
given.  The commentators are universally puzzled (if only Chimenz
[comm. to vv. 97-99] has the good sense to complain that Dante had left
the issue unresolved and problematic).  It is thus perhaps necessary to
assume that angels, whether in the ninth sphere or, as seems more
likely, in the Empyrean, are their source.  The only human souls above
them now are Jesus and Mary.  And while one cannot rule out the
possibility that it is one of them that we hear (or even both of them),
that does not seem likely, nor has anyone, perhaps, ever argued for
that solution.  And so an angelic voice or group of voices is probably
an acceptable solution, but not one that there is consensus about.
However, the inhabitants of the "spheres" (circles) of the Church
Triumphant are probably ruled out, since they are now here in the
eighth heaven and not up above.  It is as though whoever, singular or
plural, is doing that singing, were answering Dante's Italian version
of the Psalm in Latin, as though to underline his acceptance as a
hopeful member of the Church.

	|100-102.~  For the dazzling brightness of John's transfigured body,
Paget Toynbee ("Of the Legend of St. John the Evangelist [^Par~.
XXV.100-2; 112-24]," in his ^Dante Studies~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1921
{1905}], pp. 92-95) refers to the legendary accounts found, for
instance, in Vincent of Beauvais (whom he cites), Petrus Comestor, and
Jacopo da Varagine.

He is so bright that were the constellation Cancer (which shines all
night from mid-December to mid-January) to have in it a single star as
bright, it would turn one month into unbroken "day."

	|103-108.~  See Grandgent (comm. to vv. 103-111): "The three
representatives of the Christian virtues dance before Beatrice, as the
Virtues themselves did (in allegorical form) in ^Purg.~ XXIX.121-129."
Grandgent's words are repeated ^verbatim~, if without attribution, by
Singleton (comm. to vv. 103-111).

	|109-111.~  John joins his fellow apostles (Peter and James) in song as
Beatrice, as bride, looks on.

	|112-114.~  The references are to the disciple who leaned on Jesus
(John 13:23) and who was chosen by Christ on the cross to care for Mary
(John 19:27).  The pelican seemed a fitting image of Christ because the
bird was supposed to feed its young by piercing its own breast with its
beak to feed them with its blood.  The bird is mentioned (if not with
these characteristics) in Psalm 101:7 (102:6).  For a fairly extensive
note devoted to Christ as pelican, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 100-114).

	|118-121.~  Dante's blindness, as Carroll observes (comm. to these
verses), is a form of punishment for his vain curiosity about the
bodily condition of the apostle's soul; he goes on to note that it is
curious that Thomas (^ST~ suppl., q. 77, a. 1, ad 2) supports the truth
of the legend.

	|122-129.~  John says that his body has returned to earth as clay, and
will so remain until the general resurrection; only Christ and Mary are
in Heaven in the flesh, as Dante is instructed to tell those "back
home" whom he shall meet when he returns.  Tozer (comm. to vv. 127-129)
claims that Dante has ignored Enoch and Elijah, of whom Scriptures
affirm a presence in the Empyrean in the flesh; however, and as others
point out, the texts involving Enoch (Gen. 5:24; Heb. 11:5) and Elijah
(IV Re [II Kings] 2:3) make a less dramatic claim: both of them are in
a place apart (the earthly paradise in some medieval legends), but not
in Heaven.

	|124-126.~  Rachel Jacoff ("Dante and the Legend[s] of St. John,"
^Dante Studies~ 117 [1999]: 52) believes that Dante cancels the version
of the tale that has John being in Heaven in his flesh in order to
privilege Mary.  (When one considers that we are probably meant to
share the understanding that the protagonist ^is~ on this journey in
his flesh, one has to stifle a chuckle at his temporary "superiority"
in this regard to St. John.)

	|127-129.~  John, who is the very model of the biblical scribe (see,
e.g., Apoc. 22:18-19) here has become the dictator, with Dante acting
as ^his~ scribe.  He specifically licenses Dante to write the words he
has just written.

	|130-135.~    Poletto (comm. to these verses), citing Casini, is the
first commentator to find the original of this simile in Statius,
mentioning ^Thebaid~ IV.804-807 and VI.799-801.  But see Porena (comm.
to these verses [actually his second "nota finale" to this canto in the
printed version of his commentary]), who attacks such attributions as
"scholarship" run amok.  (Torraca [comm. to these verses] had
previously suggested as much, if a bit more gently.)  Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to vv. 133-135) are in accord with Porena.  However, it should
be pointed out that Porena does not discuss the Statian simile that is
closest to Dante's text (that in the sixth book), but deals with the
one in ^Thebaid~ IV and another not adduced by Poletto (^Theb~.
X.774-777).

	|131-132.~  Our translation reflects James Gaffney's suggestion
("Dante's Blindness in ^Paradiso~ XXV-XXVI: An Allegorical
Interpretation," ^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973]: 111) that the verb, ^si
quiet@o~, preserves the ambiguity between sound and movement.  In May
of 2003 Mike Addis, Princeton '05, suggested that these imagined and
orderly oarsmen seem opposed in some way to those who propelled Ulysses
on his ^folle volo~ in ^Inferno~ XXVI, careening wildly across unknown
seas.

	|136-139.~  See Acts 9:7, when Saul's companions, "hearing a voice but
seeing no man," try to see Jesus.  We may want to remember that John,
as visionary, was frequently portrayed as "blind" (see, e.g., ^Purg~.
XXIX.143-144), a familiar iconographical representation of inner sight.
