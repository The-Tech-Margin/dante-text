	|1-24.~  If the punctuation here is as Dante left it, this is
the longest single-sentence canto-opening in the poem.	See the note to
^Paradiso~ VIII.1-12 for other cantos marked by lengthy openings.  This is
also the longest address to the reader in the entire poem, if it is an
indirect one (marked by the thrice-uttered hortatory subjunctive "imagini"
[let him imagine] in vv. 1, 7, and 10). (In its triple exhortation
it mirrors the third address to the reader at ^Par.~ X.7-15. See the
note thereto.) And thus here we have another (cf. ^Par~. XI.1-3)
"pseudo-apostrophe" beginning a canto in the heaven of the Sun.

See Alison Cornish ("I miti biblici, la sapienza di Salomone e le arti
magiche," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario dantesco
internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence: Cesati,
1999],  pp. 391-403) on this passage and its relation to Solomon's
association with the "magical arts"; see also her related study
(^Reading Dante's Stars~ [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000]), pp.
93-107.

	|1-18.~  Dante's reconstruction of two perfect twelve-studded circles
(each of which he has already seen and described in the immediately
preceding cantos [^Par~. X.64-69; XII.1-21]) into apparently fanciful
constituent groupings has, understandably, drawn some perplexed
attention.  (It is perhaps difficult not to think of the role that the
poet assumes as being analogous to that of the geomancers, ^Purg~.
XIX.4-6, who similarly construct their "Fortuna Major" out of existing
constellations.)  What is the reason, we might wonder, for the
numbering of the three sub-groups as fifteen, seven, and two to equal
twenty-four?  For Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses), this is a rare
case of Dante's taste for arid preciosity ^(un preziosismo tutto
intellettualistico)~.  On the other hand, we may see in it a playful
emblem for what Dante flirts with admitting he is up to: building a
synthetic poetic universe, parallel to the real one, but expressible in
new terms.  In any case, the fifteen brightest stars found in the
eighth heaven are to be imagined as being conjoined with all the seven
that make up the Big Dipper and with two from the Little Dipper (see
the note to vv. 13-15), thus representing the twenty-four "stars" to
whom we have already been introduced.  In order to formulate a reason
for the fifteen in the first group, Francesco da Buti points out (comm.
to vv. 1-21) that Alfraganus, in the nineteenth chapter of his
^Elementa astronomica~, says that in the eighth sphere there are
precisely fifteen stars of the first magnitude (i.e., in brightness and
size).  Niccol@o Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 4-6) cites Ptolemy's ^Almagest~
for the same information (first referred to in this context by Jacopo
della Lana [comm. to vv. 1-6]), adding the detail that these fifteen
may be found situated variously in either hemisphere.  However, that
there should be nine in the last two groupings, both of which are
associated with locating the position of the North Star, may reveal the
design of a plan.  As we have seen (^Par~. II.7-9), the Pole Star
stands in for divine guidance; thus here the twin circles of Christian
sapience are associated both with divine intellectual purpose and with
the number that represents Beatrice, who is more clearly associated
with the Wisdom of God, Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, than
with anything else.

For a probably over-ingenious attempt to "allegorize" the details of
Dante's three groups of stars into nine "Italian" theologians and
fifteen of "European" birth, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-27).

	|2-3.~  This self-conscious literary gesture seeks to involve us as
co-conspirators in manufacturing a substitute solar system.  We, as
"secondary artists," are asked to collaborate, making ourselves
responsible for literalizing the details of Dante's vision and keeping
them in memory.  It is really a quite extraordinary request, even in a
poem that perhaps asks for more involvement on the part of its reader
than any fictive work in Western literary history before ^Don Quijote~.

	|7-8.~  The Wain is Ursa Major, the Big Dipper, close enough to the
Pole Star never to leave the Northern Hemisphere.

	|10-12.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) for the following
explanation of what is surely the most convoluted element in an already
convoluted passage: Dante asks us to imagine two stars of the Little
Dipper farthest from its tip as the bell of a trumpet for which the
Pole Star (at that tip) is the mouthpiece.  This last point intersects,
according to Dante (forcing the issue to his own purpose, according to
Porena [comm. to vv. 10-12]), with the Primum Mobile.  The universe is
thus conceived as a gigantic wheel, with a diameter running between our
earth and the Crystalline Sphere (even if, as Porena points out, the
situation of the North Star in the eighth sphere precludes its having
contact with the ninth).

	|13-15.~  The daughter of Minos here referred to is Ariadne.  Her
"crown" refers to the garland taken from her head by Bacchus after she
died, having been abandoned by Theseus.  Bacchus placed it in the
heavens, where it is known as the Corona Borealis (see Ovid, ^Metam~.
VIII.174-182).  Dante compares it, a single thing, to a double rainbow.
 That the poet refers to Ariadne as herself being translated to the
heavens, and not only her garland of flowers, has troubled some
commentators.  However, in a sort of reverse metonymy, Dante has given
the whole for the part; he clearly wants us to think of Ariadne's
garland as representing a circle of saints - twice.  In the last canto
(^Par~. XII.12), Juno's handmaid (the unnamed Iris) is doubled in the
sky, just as here Minos's daughter (the unnamed Ariadne) is.

For a discussion of the several possible Ovidian sources of these
verses, see Ronald L. Martinez ("Ovid's Crown of Stars [^Paradiso~
XIII.1-27]," in ^Dante and Ovid: Essays in Intertextuality~, ed.
Madison U. Sowell [Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts &
Studies, 1991], pp. 123-38): ^Ars~ I.525-564; ^Metam~. VIII.174-182;
^Fasti~ III.459-516.  That the canto eventually finds its fullest
expression of its central theme in Daedalus's trembling hand (see
discussion in the note to vv. 67-78), an object that probably has its
source in the next episode in Ovid (^Metam~. VIII.183-235), tends to
strengthen the case for the aptness of the citation from that same
^locus~ here.

	|16-18.~  Still another troubled tercet.  The first difficulty that it
presents is fairly easy to  resolve: Does the second circle extend
beyond the first or does it stand within it?  Most commentators
sensibly take the first view, since the third circle clearly is wider
than the second (^Par~. XIV.74-75), which at least implies that the
second is wider than the first and, indeed, contains it.  The really
obdurate problem, on the other hand, is how to construe verse 18.  If
one says "one went first and then the other followed" (as we translate
the line), the meaning is that one of the circles only begins to move
after the other does (and probably the first is followed by the
second).  This hypothesis is seconded by the rhyme position of the word
^poi~, used for the only time in the poem as a substantive, a usage
that pretty clearly is forced by rhyme.  What would Dante have said had
he been writing ^parole sciolte~ (words not bound by meter -- see
^Inf~. XXVIII.1), and not been constrained by the need to rhyme?  A
good case can be made for "secondo" (i.e., next).  And for this reason,
we have translated the line as we have.  See also Remo Fasani ("Canto
XIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 194), buttressing
this position with the early gloss of Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv.
1-21).  Nevertheless, a strong and continuing tradition (including such
worthies as Cristoforo Landino [comm. to verse 18] and Alessandro
Vellutello [comm. to vv. 16-21]) sees the verse as meaning that the
circles move in opposite directions.  Countering this position, Trifon
Gabriele (comm. to verse 18), maintains that the line refers to the
sequence of movements, as does Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet), who
refers to the similar locution found at ^Convivio~ IV.ii.6:."Lo
tempo... @e 'numero di movimento secondo prima e poi'" (Time... is
"number and motion with respect to before and after" [Dante is citing
Aristotle, ^Physics~ IV], tr. R. Lansing).  Scartazzini (comm. to this
verse) reviews the various shadings of the two major construings and
throws up his hands, leaving the matter unresolved and passing on to
other things.  In the next thirty-five years most who dealt with the
problem followed Landino's solution.  Then, after centuries of
inconclusive debate, refusing to choose between the two established and
conflicting views, Trucchi (comm. to this tercet) came up with a new
hypothesis: Since the two concentric circles move so that the rays sent
out by each reflect one another perfectly (he was thinking of facing
pairs, Thomas and Bonaventure, Siger and Joachim, etc.), the circles,
since they are of different extent, to maintain this unwavering
relationship between themselves, must move at different speeds.
Giacalone (comm. to this tercet) shares Trucchi's view, but credits
Buti's less clear statement (comm. to vv. 1-21) with having prepared
the way.

	|19-21.~  What Dante asks the reader to be aware of seeing is ^l'ombra
de la vera~ / ^costellazione~ (the "shadow of the real constellation"
-- cf. the similar phrases: "l'ombra del beato regno" [the shadow of
the bless@ed kingdom] -- ^Par~. I.23; "di lor vero umbriferi prefazi"
[shadowy prefaces of their truth] -- ^Par~. XXX.78).  Here the
reference to the ^vera costellazione~ has a similar typological rhythm:
What Dante saw yields to its realer version, the two circles of moving,
singing saints in their "double dance" (a phrase forced into service by
some modern commentators in order to argue that the two circles are
moving in opposite directions, while it does not necessarily contain
any such meaning).

	|22-24.~  Now the purpose of our "imagining" along with Dante that
starry construct becomes clear: the reality to which it corresponds is
as far beyond our conceiving as the circling of the Primum Mobile
exceeds in speed the movement of the Chiana, a sluggish stream in
Tuscany that turned to marsh in some places, probably referred to,
without being named, in ^Inferno~ XXIX.46-49.

	|25-27.~  In those two circles the souls were celebrating the triune
God and, in the Person of Christ, His human nature as well (a song
beyond our mortal understanding), not Bacchus or Apollo (songs all too
understandable to us).  The word ^Peana~ may either refer to cries of
praise to Apollo or, as seems more likely here, to the god himself.

For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

	|28-30.~  This part of the canto comes to a close with the souls
turning their attention from their celebration of their Trinitarian
God, in dance and song, to dealing with Dante's doubts, a process that
also brings them pleasure.  They shift their attention from Dante's
first question (rephrased at ^Par~. XI.25), now answered, to his second
(see ^Par~. XIII.89).

This whole section has the characteristics of being an epitome of
Dante's primary task as an artist, to mediate between the divine and
the human.  God's immediate creation is gradually revealing itself to
him, and he is putting it into art that we can understand, even if it
is not precisely as His, but an approximation.

	|31-36.~  Thomas, who is identified as the one who had narrated the
life of Francis, as circumlocutory as ever, refers to his having
answered Dante's first question (see ^Par~. X.91-93) and now prepares
(finally) to deal with the second.

	|31.~  The word ^numi~, a hapax and a Latinism (from ^numen~), here
means "divinities" (translated as "holy souls").  It seems to owe its
presence to the exigencies of rhyme.

	|34-36.~  Thomas's agricultural metaphor combines pedantic heaviness
with one perhaps surprising touch: affection.

The word ^paglia~ (straw) occurs once in each ^cantica~, ^Inferno~
XXIII.66, ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.93, and here.

	|37-51.~  Thomas corrects Dante's misprision of what he had told him
about Solomon in Canto X.  Reduced to its core, this is what he conveys
to the protagonist: "You believe that God, when he created Adam and
(the human part of) Christ, gave each of them as much intellect as it
was possible to create in a human being; if that is so, you wonder, how
can I have said that Solomon's intelligence never was bettered by
another's?  I will now clear up your confusion."

	|37-42.~  Metonymic periphrasis abounds in these lines about Adam and
Eve and Jesus, respectively identified by his rib cage, her pretty face
and fatal appetite, and His rib cage.  Dante treats the "wound" in
Adam's side from which God formed Eve and that in Christ's side as
corresponding, for the sin of the first parents was atoned for by the
latter wound.

	|40-41.~  Exactly what is referred to by these words is much debated.
See the summarizing treatment offered by Giacalone (comm. to vv.
37-45), which offers the following sense of the matter in dispute.
Christ redeemed, with his death on the cross, sins committed either (1)
in the past or in the future; or (2) before His life on earth and after
it; or (3) before His flesh was pierced on the cross and after the
Crucifixion.  While it seems that the third of these alternatives is
the most appealing (because it builds on the parallel structure of the
entire passage, moving from Adam's rib to Christ's wounded side), it is
also true that all three interpretations cause similar reflection:
Christ died for our sins.

According to Willy Schwarz ("Si trovano in Dante echi delle opinioni
teologiche di Pietro Olivi? -- Dante e i Templari," in ^Atti del
Congresso internazionale di studi danteschi~, vol. II [Florence:
Sansoni, 1966], pp. 147-48), these lines reflect the opinion of Peter
Olivi (against the account found in John 19:30) that Jesus was pierced
by the lance while he was still alive.  Schwarz believes that
^Paradiso~ XXXII.128 reflects the same understanding.  For the view
that Dante was deeply aware of Olivi's work and essentially agreed with
it, but never mentions his name because the Franciscan was being
vigorously attacked by Church officials in Provence, who managed to
have his ^Lectura super Apocalypsim~ condemned, see Manselli,
"francescanesimo," ^ED~ III (1971), p. 16.

	|43-48.~  God the Father made the corporeal natures of Adam and Christ
directly.  Eve is not mentioned here, perhaps for obvious reasons,
since Dante restricts his attention to the sinless Adam and Christ.  It
is also true that Eve was made a bit differently than they were,
representing a "secondary primary" creation, as it were, since God
fashioned her out of a single rib of his direct creation, Adam.  All
other human bodies are formed with the influence of intermediating
agencies (i.e., the angels and the stars).  And thus, in Dante's view,
Thomas's statement of Solomon's singular intellectual gifts (^Par~.
X.112-114) does indeed require further explanation, to which a goodly
portion of the rest of the canto (vv. 49-111) will be devoted.

	|49-51.~  This tercet perhaps exemplifies the "unpoetic" quality of
this canto (representing the sort of "philosophic discourse" that
Benedetto Croce so often inveighed against [e.g., ^La poesia di Dante~,
2nd ed. {Bari: Laterza, 1921}]), the cause of its being denigrated even
by those to whose lot it fell to write ^lecturae~ dedicated to it.  For
documentation, see Courtney Cahill ("The Limitations of Difference in
^Paradiso~ XIII's Two Arts: Reason and Poetry," ^Dante Studies~ 114
[1996]), p. 245 and note 1 (p. 266).

	|50-51.~  Thomas's figure of speech, insisting that Dante's view of
Adam's and Christ's knowledge and his own championing of Solomon's not
only do not contradict one another, but are equally close to the truth
as are two points coinciding at the center of a circle.

	|52-87.~  This portion of Thomas's speech is one of the most
"philosophical" in the entire poem.  It may serve as a pretext for
answering the protagonist's concern about Solomon's relative perfection
as knower; at the same time, we sense that the poet simply wanted to
posit his view of primary and secondary creation.  Does the passage
reveal Dante's notion of creation to be neoplatonizing or "orthodox"?
In James Simpson's view ("Poetry as Knowledge: Dante's ^Paradiso~
XIII," ^Forum for Modern Language Studies~ 25 [1989]: 329-56) it is
orthodox.  See Courtney Cahill's discussion ("The Limitations of
Difference in ^Paradiso~ XIII's Two Arts: Reason and Poetry," ^Dante
Studies~ 114 [1996], p. 251), citing Simpson's argument to that effect
(pp. 339-40).

For a straightforward explanation, in simplified terms, of the passage,
see Tozer (comm. to these verses): "What is created directly by God is
perfect, whereas that which is created indirectly by Him through
intermediate agencies and materials is imperfect; and therefore Dante
is right in thinking that Adam, and Christ in His human nature, who
belong to the former class, must have been superior in wisdom to all
men, and therefore to Solomon."

	|52.~  "That which does not die" resolves into God, the angels, the
heavens, prime matter, and the human soul; "that which must [die]"
refers to all corruptible things (see ^Par~. VII.133-141 and the note
to vv. 124-138).

	|53-54.~  All that God makes, eternal and bound by time, is made
radiant by reflecting the Word (Christ as Logos) made by the Father
(Power) in his Love (the Holy Spirit).  Moevs (^The Metaphysics of
Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], p. 121)
describes this process: "All things, mortal and immortal, are the
(apparently self-subsistent) reflection ^(splendore)~ of the idea (the
Word-Son-Christ) born from Intellect-Being (our Father, ^il nostro
Sire~) through an act of love (the Holy Spirit, ^amando~).  Since form
is not a thing, but both the principle of being itself and the
principle through which all things participate in being, metaphysically
it corresponds to the Son or Word, the Second Person of the Trinity.
Finite form arises through love (the Third Person); it is the power of
self-subsistent awareness or being (the First Person) to experience
itself as, or give itself to, finite attribute and identity."

	|55-60.~  The first step in this procession of God into His universe is
for the Trinity to be reflected in the nine orders of angels (see the
note to verse 59).  See Christian Moevs on these six verses: "The
Trinity evoked in the [preceding] tercet is evoked again [in this one]:
the Word-Son is a living light ... which flows from the source of light
(... the Father), but is not other than ... its source: both are a
power of love, ... which 'en-threes' itself with them" (^The
Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2005], p. 121).

	|57.~  Dante's coinage ^intrearsi~ (literally, "to inthree oneself")
represents a form of linguistic boldness to which the reader has
perhaps become accustomed.  See, for example, the verb ^incinquarsi~
(literally, "to infive oneself") in ^Paradiso~ IX.40.

	|59.~  This is the first appearance (see ^Par~. XXXIII.115; and see
^Par~. XXIX.15 for the shining angelic substance announcing itself in
the Latin verb ^subsistere~ [to exist]) of the Scholastic-flavored noun
"subsistence," i.e., existence as purely related to God's nature as is
possible, here, in the nine orders of angels.  Cf. ^Paradiso~ XIV.73
and the note thereto.  And see Alfonso Maier@u, "sussistenza," ^ED~ V
(1976), pp. 493a-94b, who cites Boethius, in ^De duabus naturis~,
referring to "a being, which, in order to be able itself to exist, has
no need of any other being."  See also Tozer (comm. to vv. 58-59):
"These are called 'subsistences,' because this is the Scholastic term
for that which exists by itself, and not in anything else; cp. Aquinas
[^ST~ I, q. 29, a. 2]."  Among the earliest commentators there is a
certain hesitation in choosing between angels and heavens (e.g., Jacopo
della Lana [comm. to vv. 55-60]).  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 55-60),
however, is definitive in seeing the angels here ("idest in novem
ordines angelorum").  The dispute meandered along until Scartazzini's
magisterial review (comm. to this verse) of that errancy and his
interpretation fixed the identification (Benvenuto's) for nearly all
later discussants: the nine orders of angels.  Scartazzini invokes
passages in Dante's own texts: ^Epistle~ XIII, ^Convivio~ II.v and
III.xiv, and most particularly ^Paradiso~ XXIX.142-145.  Today one
cannot find a discussant who has not benefited from Scartazzini's
gloss, whether directly or indirectly; at the same time one can find no
commentator (at least not among those included in the DDP) who even
mentions him, although Singleton (comm. to this verse) does cite two of
the Dantean passages that he cited.

	|60.~  The presence of Christ, Itself three-personed but unitary, is
reflected by myriads of angels in nine groups.

	|61-66.~  The second stage of God's progression (for the first see the
note to vv. 55-60) is into that part of the universe created out of the
four elements and, not directly by God, but indirectly and by various
agencies.  Lombardi (comm. to vv. 55-63) refers the reader to
^Paradiso~ II.112-141 for an earlier exposition of this process.  The
light of the Word (verse 55) blends its creative power with the angelic
presences in each heavenly sphere, moving downward "from act to act"
and reaching the elements, until it finally interacts with the most
short-lived perishable things, ^brevi contingenze~ (brief
contingencies).  According to Scholastic philosophy, contingent things
have the potential either to be or not to be, depending on the presence
or absence of a conjoined formal property.  Those perishable things
that are shaped by form are, if produced from seed, animal or
vegetable; if not, mineral.  (For Daniello [comm. to vv. 64-66], this
category [things born without seed] includes only animals born from
putrefaction.

	|67-78.~  To explain the principle of difference, the results of which
are so noticeable to any observer of any species, Thomas, wanting to
avoid imputing to God a causal relation with mortality, ugliness,
and/or failure, puts the blame for such things on Great Creating
Nature.  Thus the angel-derived powers of the planetary spheres are
seen as waxing and waning, and the resultant creations (e.g., human
beings, horses, zucchini, and garnets) variable.

Courtney Cahill ("The Limitations of Difference in ^Paradiso~ XIII's
Two Arts: Reason and Poetry," ^Dante Studies~ 114 [1996], pp. 256-65)
discusses this passage at some length (in a portion of her study
subtitled "The Limitations of the ^artista~ in Thomas's Discourse on
Creation").  Among other things, she puts forward the telling argument
(p. 268, n. 25) that Thomas's initial presentation of Nature as perfect
maker of God's creation is intentionally contradicted here, in order to
account for the difference we find all around us in the world.  She
also finds that the image of the artist's trembling hand reflects that
of Daedalus, as portrayed by Ovid (^Metam~. VIII.211), citing Hollander
("Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992], pp. 229-30)
for an earlier and identical observation.  See also Hollander (^Il
Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~  [Florence: Olschki,
1983], p. 135n.) for the suggestion that this passage may also reflect
^Aeneid~ VI.32-33, recounting Daedalus's double fatherly failure as
artist to portray in gold his son's fall from the skies.

As opposed to her performance in God's direct creation, Nature, when
she is working with the "wax" of secondary creation (i.e., not the
first man, Adam, but his descendants; not the first apple, but the
succeeding "generations" of the fruit, etc.), is ^always~ defective,
coming up short of the archetype.

	|77.~  For the word ^artista~ and its four appearances in the poem
(here and ^Par~. XVI.51; XVIII.51; XXX.33), see Hollander ("Dante and
Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992]), p. 217; Cahill ("The
Limitations of Difference in ^Paradiso~ XIII's Two Arts: Reason and
Poetry," ^Dante Studies~ 114 [1996]), p. 257.

	|79-87.~  Once again the Trinity is referred to, Spirit, Son, Father
(in that order), in order to distinguish between direct creation, under
God's unshared auspices, as distinct from the natural secondary
creation of which we have just heard.  Thus twice in history human
beings were made outside the natural process, with the creation of Adam
(as well as Eve, now not referred to by Dante, perhaps, but we can
hardly forget that she was indeed remembered in vv. 37-39) and of Jesus
marking the limits of human perfection, well beyond the otherwise
unmatchable king of Israel.

	|88-96.~  Without further explanation, Thomas says, Dante might still
remain dubious; if he only considers who Solomon was and what moved him
to ask for wisdom, he will understand.  See III Kings (I Kings) 3:5-12,
in which passage God appears to Solomon in a dream and promises to
grant him whatever he asks for.  Solomon responds by saying that God
has made His servant into a king, but a king who has need of a knowing
heart to judge his people.  God, pleased by his answer, replies (in the
passage quoted in ^Par~. X.114 [and see the note to vv. 109-114]) "dedi
tibi cor sapiens et intelligens, in tantum ut nullus ante te similis
tui fuerit ^nec post te surrecturus sit~" (I have given you a wise and
an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, nor
after you shall any arise who is like you [III Kings 3:12 -- italics
added]).

According to Giuseppe Toffanin ("Canto XIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier,
1968]), p. 453, Dante's veneration of Solomon the king is the high
point of his Ghibellinism.

	|97-102.~  Thomas now contrasts practical kingly wisdom with typical
Scholastic speculations, drawn from the following four fields:
speculative theology (How many are the angels?), dialectic (Will a
mixture of a necessary and a contingent premise ever yield a necessary
conclusion?), natural science (Must we grant that motion had a
beginning?), and geometry (Can a triangle be constructed in a
semi-circle in such a way that it not contain a right angle?).  (All
four answers are negative, beginning with the fact that, according to
Dante, the angels are not numerable.)  In Dante's view, Solomon's
practical wisdom trumps all such formal intelligence.  However, for a
far different appraisal of Solomon's kingly wisdom, see Carroll (comm.
to vv. 88-111): "The real difficulty is that, history being the
witness, all Solomon's wisdom did not make him 'sufficient as a king.'
The outward brilliance of his reign was but a veil which hid for the
moment the slow sapping of his people's strength and character through
his luxury and licentiousness, his tyrannies, exactions, and
idolatries.  He sowed the wind, and his son reaped the whirlwind when
the down-trodden people rent the greater part of the kingdom out of his
hand.  Whatever Dante may say, Solomon as a king was perhaps the wisest
fool who ever lived.  In saying this, I am quite aware that I may be
incurring the censure on hasty judgments with which Canto XIII closes."

On Solomon's song as leading to truthful (and not seductive, deceiving)
love, see Marguerite Chiarenza ("Solomon's Song in the ^Divine
Comedy~," in ^Sparks and Seeds: Medieval Literature and Its Afterlife
[Essays in Honor of John Freccero]~, ed. Dana E. Stewart and Alison
Cornish [Turnhout: Brepols, 2000], pp. 199-208).

	|97.~  For Dante's own thoughts on this question, see ^Convivio~
II.iv.3-15 and II.v.4-5, ^Paradiso~ XXVIII.92-93 and XXIX.130-135.  The
angels are "quasi innumerabili" (all but innumerable [^Conv~. II.v.5]).

procedures, see Oelsner (comm. to vv. 97-102): "It is a general
principle that no limitation that occurs in either of the premises can
be escaped in the conclusion.  Thus, if either of the premises is
negative you cannot get a positive conclusion; if either of them is
particular you cannot get a general conclusion; if either is contingent
you cannot get a necessary conclusion.  For instance, from 'The man on
whom the lot falls ^must~ be sacrificed,' and 'The lot ^may~ fall on
you,' you can infer: 'therefore you ^may~ be sacrificed,' but not
'therefore you ^must~ be sacrificed.'  Ingenious attempts to get a
necessary conclusion out of a necessary and a contingent premise are
exposed by the logicians, ^e.g.~ 'Anyone who may run from the foe must
be a coward; some of these troops may run from the foe, therefore some
of them must be cowards.'  The fallacy lies in the ambiguous use of
'may run from the foe.'  In the first instance it means, 'is, ^as a
matter of fact~, capable of running away'; in the second, 'may, ^for
anything I know~, run away.'  So that the two propositions do not hang
together, and the conclusion is invalid."

	|100.~  That is, whether one can accept the notion that there existed a
first motion, preceding all other motion.  Benvenuto (comm. to vv.
97-102), after saying that, according to Aristotle's ^Physics~ [VIII.1]
motion is eternal, insists that theologians find that it, like the
world, has a beginning, and goes on to cite Genesis 1:1: "In the
beginning God made the heavens and the earth."  That was the First
Mover's first motion; before that nothing moved.

	|101-102.~  See Euclid, ^Geometria~ III.31: All triangles inscribed in
a circle, if the line bisecting that circle is used as their base, will
have a right angle at their apex.  And see Thomas Hart ("Geometric
Metaphor and Proportional Design in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^The
"Divine Comedy" and the Encyclopedia of Arts and Sciences: Acta of the
International Dante Symposium, 13-16 November 1983, Hunter College, New
York~, ed. G. Di Scipio and A. Scaglione [Amsterdam: John Benjamins,
1988], pp. 105-23), arguing for a structural relation between the
elements in Euclid's theorem and the construction of the ^Commedia~.

	|103-105.~  And so, rounding off his oratory, Thomas insists that
kingly prudence is to be valued more highly than speculative philosophy
(a position that coincides with that put forth in the ^Epistle to
Cangrande~ [^Epist~. XIII.40-41], where Dante says that the branch of
philosophy that the ^Comedy~ embraces is ethics, since the project of
the poem is not speculation, but action).  See the dispute over this
point between Baranski and Hollander (Hollander, ^Dante's Epistle to
Cangrande~ [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993]), pp. 90-91.

	|106-108.~  For Dante (or Thomas) to insist that what was said of
Solomon earlier (^Par~. X.114) corresponds to what is said now strains
credulity, and not a little.  If Dante had offered something to the
effect that neither Adam nor Christ had to "rise," since they were made
differently from all other mortals (except for Eve, conveniently lost
from sight in all discussions of this passage), since they were
directly produced by God, without intermediation (a tactic attempted by
both the Ottimo [comm. to vv. 103-108] and Benvenuto [comm. to vv.
103-108]), then we might see the problem as resolved.  However, the
text rather pointedly fails to offer any such limitation.

If one examines the commentaries to ^Paradiso~ X.114, hardly anyone
before the twentieth century thinks that the reference is to Solomon as
king.  For one who did, see Benvenuto (comm. to ^Par~. X.109-114), who
says that the phrase means that he has "no equal among kings."
Benvenuto, perhaps the most competent reader of poetic text among all
the earlier students of Dante, had likely remembered the addition found
in this later passage, even if he does not refer to it.  Scartazzini
(comm. to ^Par~. X.114) also makes this point, referring to the later
passage and interpreting it in Thomas's way.  But this may be said of
few others before 1900 (twentieth-century readers of ^Paradiso~ X
nearly all do look ahead to this passage).  In fact, the biblical text
that lies behind both passages (III Kings 3:12) does not qualify
Solomon's excellence by reference to a "peer group," i.e., that text
represents him as the wisest among all humans, not only kings.  Thus we
once again have a sense that the text of ^Paradiso~, in comparison with
its predecessors, was left in a relatively unfinished condition at
Dante's death; he could have handled the issue better when he
introduced it.

	|109-111.~  With the distinction added in the preceding tercet (Dante's
wording almost gives away the fact that no such distinction was
intended in his first utterance on the subject), the protagonist can
understand how Solomon was first among the wise kings without
infringing upon the primacy of either Adam (the "first father") or of
Jesus (the "One we love").

	|112-142.~  The final 31 lines of this canto, a text that has, on the
authority of none other than Thomas Aquinas, just established Solomon's
kingly wisdom as a defining part of Dante's theocratic view of the
world's affairs, nonetheless offer a warning to all of us who tend to
rush to judgment, whether in relation to matters philosophical or
theological.  As we shall see (vv. 133-138), there is an
autobiographical component to this plea.

For Dante to have used so much poetic space on so apparently simple,
even banal, a topic tells his readers how keenly he felt involved in
the problem.  Once again we sense how, as he looks back over his
intellectual development from the vantage point of the making of this
great work, he realizes how self-centered some of his earlier attitudes
were.  (See Hollander ["Dante's Pride," in ^Studi sul canone letterario
del Trecento: Per Michelangelo Picone~, a cura di J. Bartuschat and L.
Rossi {Ravenna: Longo, 2003}, pp. 43-55].)

	|112-114.~  We have seen how slowly the hypocrites made their way
forward in ^Inferno~ XXIII, in their leaden capes.  Just so should we
approach affirming or denying the truth of matters we have not fully
examined.

	|115-120.~  A rush to judgment is, unsurprisingly, condemned.  In the
last verse, Dante's genial understanding of the way we humans tend to
fall in love with whatever opinion we contrive to form rescues the
passage from banality.  If there is one passage in the last four cantos
in which the voice of Thomas, usually so fully "captured" by the poet
and so distinct from his own, seems to be indistinguishable from
Dante's, it is found in these six lines.

	|121-127.~  The metaphor for the search for truth moves to fishing.  We
hear first of three Greek philosophers of the fifth century B.C., then
of two heretical thinkers of the early Christian era .  Each of these
groups is represented as standing for many another thinker who also
lacks rigor.

	|121-123.~  Within the metaphor, the fisherman without the necessary
skills of his craft not only returns home without a catch, but tired
(or worse) from the voyage; outside of it, the thinker who lacks the
proper intellectual tools not only fails to arrive at the truth, but
enmeshes himself in failure.

	|125.~  The founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy and his pupil,
Parmenides and Melissus, are both mentioned in ^Monarchia~ III.iv.4 as,
according to Aristotle, using false premises and invalid syllogisms.
Bryson, a less-known figure living in the same fifth century, was
criticized by Aristotle for using invalid methods in his attempts to
square the circle.

	|127.~  Sabellius and Arius, Christians of the third and fourth
centuries, respectively.  Longfellow characterizes them as follows:
"Sabellius was by birth an African, and flourished as Presbyter of
Ptolemais, in the third century.  He denied the three persons in the
Godhead, maintaining that the Son and Holy Ghost were only temporary
manifestations of God in creation, redemption, and sanctification, and
would finally return to the Father.  Arius was a Presbyter of
Alexandria in the fourth century.  He believed the Son to be equal in
power with the Father, but of a different essence or nature, a doctrine
which gave rise to the famous Heterousian and Homoiousian controversy,
that distracted the Church for three hundred years."

Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 59, points
out that both of these thinkers were confused about the relationships
among God's ^substance~ and his ^persons~, and suggests that Dante may
have been led to his thought by a sentence attributed to Athanasius by
Alain de Lille (^PL~ CCX.749): "Neque confundentes personas, ut
Sabellius, neque substantiam separantes, ut Arius" (Neither confounding
the Persons, as did Sabellius, nor putting asunder His substance, as
did Arius).

	|128-129.~  Sabellius, Arius, and their ilk are compared to swords in
which human faces are reflected in distorted ways; just so were they to
Scripture distorting mirrors of revealed truth.  This comparison has
disturbed many recent readers, to whom it seems either forced or
unintelligible.  The early commentators, however, were apparently more
at ease with it, as though they thought of faces reflected on the
irregular surfaces of shiny sword blades as a matter of course.
Lombardi (comm. to these verses) at the close of the eighteenth century
loses control of himself when confronting Venturi's continuance of that
tradition.  Swords, he shouts, were metaphorically the instruments of
heretics who mutilated Scripture to make it accord with their nefarious
purposes.  For a while his intervention ruled in Italy (at Harvard,
Longfellow just mentioned the two interpretations and took no side).
Then Scartazzini (comm. to these verses) took Lombardi's argument apart
(e.g., the language in the passage really does speak of mirroring
rather than destruction), as did Poletto (comm. to vv. 127-129).
Still, the debate continues into our own day, with the older position
holding the edge, but not without challenge.

Strangely enough, hardly anyone has turned his attention to the Bible
as potential source, since the reference is to it.  (It is not
surprising that the single exception is Scartazzini [comm. to these
vv.], if his two passages in the Psalms [56:5 and 63:4] are not exactly
germane.)  No one has apparently adduced the Scriptural passage
containing one of the Bible's surprisingly few references to mirrors
(as was pointed out by Carolyn Calvert Phipps in a graduate seminar on
the ^Paradiso~ in 1980): the Epistle of James 1:23-24: "For if any be a
hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his
natural face in a glass; for he beholds himself, and goes his way, and
straightway forgets what manner of man he was."  That is not a perfect
fit, either, but it does at least share the basic context of these
verses.

Carroll (comm. to vv. 121-128) reminds the reader that Thomas (who is,
after all, the speaker here) had refuted both these heresies (Sabellius
on the Trinity, Arius on the non-consubstantiality of the Son with the
Father).  See ^Summa contra Gentiles~ IV.5-8.

	|130-132.~  We find a shift in the object of Thomas's measured scorn,
from the schooled (philosophers and theologians) to the unschooled,
ordinary folk ^(Donna Berta e ser Martino)~, as well as in the subject
in which their misprision functions, from thoughts about the nature of
things to the afterlife of one's neighbors.

	|133-138.~  The two examples, in reverse order, reminded John Carroll
(comm. to vv. 129-142) of the father and son, Guido and Buonconte da
Montefeltro.  Guido, according to Dante in ^Convivio~ (IV.xxviii.8),
was saved, but then was registered as one of the damned in ^Inferno~
XXVII, his story presented in both texts as a sea voyage; his son,
Buonconte, although suffering a cruel death, in his agony spoke the
name of Mary, the "rose," and was saved (^Purg~. V).  Trucchi (comm. to
vv. 139-142) makes the same point, but with less effect.  And see
Andr$e P$ezard (Peza.1965.1), ^ad loc~., for an attempt to locate both
the rose and the ship of this passage in ^Convivio~ IV.xxvii.7 and
IV.xxviii.8

For readers of ^Convivio~, Dante has placed his former writing self
among the Berthas and Martins (see verse 139) of the world.  Perhaps
recognizing ourselves described in vv. 118-120, we may share that sense.

	|135.~  For the phrase "la rosa in su la cima" (the bloom of roses at
its tip), see ^Purgatorio~ XI.92.

	|136-138.~  For this tercet as referring to Ulysses and his
ill-conceived final voyage, see Courtney Cahill ("The Limitations of
Difference in ^Paradiso~ XIII's Two Arts: Reason and Poetry," ^Dante
Studies~ 114 [1996], pp. 254-55).  Trucchi (comm. to vv. 133-138) seems
to have been her only precursor, if his mention of Ulysses (and
Manfred) is only in passing.

	|139.~  The foolish "donna Berta e ser Martino" remind Carlo Grabher
(comm. to vv. 34-142) of what Dante says in ^Convivio~ (IV.v.9) about
those vile beasts who desire to know what is known only to God.  A
woman named Bertha had already enjoyed a role in Dante's displeasure
with less-than-sophisticated writing; see ^De vulgari eloquentia~
II.vi.5: "Petrus amat multum dominam Bertam" (Peter loves Mistress
Bertha a lot).

	|140-142.~  These verses have made many a reader uncomfortable with
Dante's behavior in them.  Is not ^he~ one who claims to have knowledge
of divine wisdom?  Furthermore, the concealed reference to his failed
judgment of such things in ^Convivio~ (see the note to vv. 133-138)
reads back at him in upsetting ways.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.
112-142) point out that this entire passage needs to be read in the
context of the medieval dispute over the damnation/salvation of Solomon
(see the note to ^Par~. X.109-114).  We remember that such great
figures as Jerome (who thought Solomon was saved) and Augustine (who
thought he was not) disagreed over this matter.  It is clear that Dante
is willing to risk considerable intellectual capital in the
presentation of his case for Solomon.  Sarolli has done a great deal to
explain the choice of the other Old Testament figure, Nathan, for
inclusion here (see the note to ^Par~. XII.136).  As a "type" of Dante
the prophet, he joins Solomon, the overwhelmingly important figure
among twenty-four "stars" of theological and religious importance, as
agents of explanation of Dante's function in his own poem, as prophet,
as poet, as supporter of the imperial monarchy.

	|142.~  As a coda to the Solomon theme, present on and off since
^Paradiso~ X.109 and that was almost immediately accompanied by its
hallmark, the verb ^surgere~ (^Par~. X.114; X.140; XIII.106), the poet
marks the conclusion of that thematic unit with its final presence.
