	|1-9.~  Dante, in the course of celebrating his noble birthright, uses
the occasion to condemn any such self-aggrandizing sentiments.  The
appeal of noble bloodlines is so great, the poet explains, that he took
pride in his ancestry even now in the heavens, where he assuredly
should have known better.  For a meditation on the problematical nature
of Dante's ideas about nobility, see Nino Borsellino ("Sotto il segno
di Marte: la cronaca del padre antico ([Par. XVI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 5
[1995]: 39-41).

Boethius (^Cons~. III.6[pr]) proclaims the emptiness of a noble name in
a passage also probably echoed by Dante in ^Convivio~ (IV.xx.5).  See
also ^Monarchia~ (II.iii.4), words that sound much like Francesco da
Buti's gloss to these verses, citing Boethius in distinguishing
nobility of soul from "corporeal" nobility (i.e., that established by
bloodline).

Where at the close of Canto XIV Dante claims that he was not wrong in
not praising Beatrice there, here he states that it was wrong indeed to
feel himself glorified in his ancestry.

	|7-9.~  This apostrophe of nobility of blood employs a metaphor, in
which the mantle (or cloak) of nobility of blood grows shorter each
generation that fails to ornament its reputation by earning further
genuine honors (as did Cacciaguida, dying a martyr's death on crusade).

	|10-12.~  Dante, finally knowing who it is whom he addresses, used the
honorific ^voi~ to hail his ancestor, the "You" that was first given to
Julius Caesar, according to Lucan (^Phars~. V.383-386), but is now
little used by the contemporary Romans, descended into a state
approaching barbarism in Dante's eyes (see ^Dve~ I.xi.2).  (Perhaps the
first to observe the Lucanian source was Pietro di Dante [Pietro1,
comm. to this tercet; Pietro2, comm. to vv. 1-15; Pietro3, comm. to vv.
10-15].)  Lucan, prompted by his hatred of Julius (and of Nero, for
whom Julius occasionally stands in), has invented this particular in
his True History of Authoritarian Language, a fabrication that
eventually came to light.  According to him, since Julius, assuming his
role as dictator, also assumed the many roles of those Romans who had
previously held positions of responsibility in republican Rome, he
needed to be addressed in a way that represented the plurality of his
roles.  Gabriele (comm. to verse 10) was perhaps the first to express
some doubt about Lucan's observation; Lombardi spiked it through the
heart (comm. to vv. 10-15).  The "honorific You" actually came into
use, explains Scartazzini (comm. to verse 10), only in the third
century.

	|13-15.~  This tercet returns to a scene that had been focal to the
pivotal moment in the adulterous passion between Francesca and Paolo in
^Inferno~ V, the kiss exchanged by Lancelot and Guinevere in the
twelfth-century Old French prose romance ^Lancelot du lac~.  See
Toynbee, "Galeotto" (^Concise Dante Dictionary~).  Umberto Carpi (^La
nobilt@a di Dante~ [Florence: Polistampa, 2004], vol. I, pp. 24-25 and
256) refines the general appreciation of the reference, pointing out
(and crediting Pietro Beltrami for the observation leading to his
insight) that Guinevere's handmaid did not cough when the queen and
Lancelot kissed, but before that, when she revealed to her admirer that
she was aware of his name and of his lofty lineage.  Her words cause
the lady-in-waiting to cough as a way of informing Lancelot that ^she~
finally knows his identity and nobility of blood.  Thus Beatrice,
hearing Dante's response to his own genealogical distinction, the ^voi~
with which he addresses his ancestor, smiles in knowing response to
that.  That she does so as a warning against such pride seems clear,
even if some commentators insist on a friendlier, less critical
attitude at this height in the heavens.

	|16-18.~  The poet again contorts the order of events for his narrative
purposes; the words that the protagonist speaks ^precede~, naturally,
Beatrice's reaction to them (vv. 13-15).  Indeed, we may realize that
the preceding ^terzina~ (vv. 10-12) also reflects what he has said just
now.

These three parallel uses of the honorific ^voi~ for Cacciaguida,
emotive anaphora (see Francesca's ^Amor~... ^Amor~... ^Amor~ in ^Inf~.
V.100-106), offer an outpouring of ancestral affection, but more than
tinged with vainglory, the sin we saw corrected on the terrace of Pride
in Purgatory.

This program (of honorific address uttered by the protagonist) began in
^Inferno~ X, with Farinata and Cavalcante.  It had one more appearance
in the first ^cantica~, with Brunetto Latini.  In ^Purgatorio~, Currado
Malaspina, Pope Adrian V, Guinizzelli, and Beatrice all received the
respectful ^voi~ in salutation.  In this concluding canticle, Beatrice
receives it three times (^Par~. IV.122-134), and Cacciaguida also three
times, all in this tercet, in a final "explosion" that lays it to rest.
 (See the notes to ^Inf~. X.49-51 and to ^Purg~. XIX.131; also to
^Par~. XXXI.79-90.)

	|16.~  The protagonist addresses seven beings as "father" in the poem:
first of all Virgil, a total of seven times (between ^Purg~. IV.44 and
XXIII.13); then God (in the guise of Apollo) in ^Paradiso~ I.28;
Cacciaguida (here and in ^Par~. XVII.106); St. Benedict (^Par~.
XXII.58); St. Peter (^Par~. XXIV.62 and XXIV.124); Adam (^Par~.
XXVI.92); and finally St. Bernard (^Par~. XXXII.100).  Dante the poet
refers to five others as being his "fathers": Brunetto Latini (^Inf~.
XV.83); Cato (^Purg~. I.33); Guido Guinizzelli (^Purg~. XXVI.97); St.
Francis (^Par~. XI.85); and the Sun (^Par~. XXII.116).  For a study of
the "program" of Dante's fathers in the poem, see Frank Ordiway
(^Dante, Chaucer, and the Poetics of the Past~ [unpublished doctoral
dissertation, Princeton University, 1990]).

	|17.~  For ^baldezza~ (here translated "bold assurance"), see Aldo
Vallone ("'Baldanza' - 'baldezza' dai Siciliani a Dante," in ^Atti del
Convegno di studi su Dante e la Magna Curia~ [Palermo: Luxograph,
1967], pp. 315-32).

	|19.~  These "rivers" are, resolved from metaphor, the sources of the
protagonist's pleasure in the knowledge of his lineage and in his
election to join Cacciaguida among the saved souls here and,
eventually, in the Empyrean.

	|22-27.~  The protagonist wants to know (1) the root of his roots, as
it were; (2) about the times in Florence when Cacciaguida was a youth;
(3) the number of inhabitants in the city in those days; and (4) the
best people in the city then.  His first question is reminiscent of
Farinata's to him (^Inf~. X.42), "Chi fuor li maggior tui?" (Who were
your ancestors?).

	|28-32.~  This simile, at least from the time of Scartazzini (comm. to
vv. 28-33), has been recognized as Ovidian in provenance, reflecting
the similar comparison (^Metam~. VII.79-81) describing Medea's renewed
infatuation with Jason.  It seems odd that, for a description of
Cacciaguida's rekindled affection for his great-great-grandson, Dante
should resort to Ovid's description of Medea's reignited passion for
the handsome youth who will, as she almost fully realizes, betray her.
(Dante had previously visited a part of this long passage dedicated to
Medea and Jason [VII.1-403] in ^Par~. II.16-18.  For the "rewriting" of
Ovid involved in that tercet, see the note to ^Par~. II.17-18.)

	|33.~  What language does Cacciaguida speak?  Breaking ranks with the
vast majority of modern commentators who believe that it is
twelfth-century Florentine, Porena (comm. to ^Par~. XVI.154) suggests
that it is Latin.  This solution had already been proposed by Daniello
(comm. to this verse).  It was held in favor until Poletto, some 330
years later, perhaps rightly sensing that Dante never would have used
the terms "dolce" or "soave" to describe Latin as contrasted with the
vernacular, cited Beatrice's use of Florentine vernacular, as referred
to at ^Inferno~ II.57, as part of his understanding that the text
refers to the Italian spoken in Cacciaguida's time.  Grabher (comm. to
vv. 28-33) is firm in denying Daniello's hypothesis; he favors a
reference to Cacciaguida's use of the Florentine vernacular.  (Grabher
also denigrates a second theory, which had occasionally been been
pressed into service after Vellutello introduced it [comm. to vv.
28-33], that Cacciaguida spoke in "the tongues of angels.")  He, like
Poletto, is sure that it is best to understand that Dante is concerned
here with the transitory nature of any stage in a vernacular tongue's
development, as reflected in ^Convivio~ I.v.9, a concern that led to
his promise, in the next sentence, to take up that matter in ^De
vulgari eloquentia~ (which he did: see ^Dve~ I.ix.6).  Andr$e P$ezard
("Les trois langues de Cacciaguida," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 16
[1967]: 217-38), for all intents and purposes, resolved the issue in
favor of the Florentine vernacular of the twelfth century.

	|34-36.~  The Annunciation, occurring on March 25 of the first year of
Christian history, marked by the words "Ave Maria" in Gabriel's Latin,
coincides with the date of the new year as measured by Florentines in
Dante's age.  It is probably not an accident that we are supposed to
understand that the poem itself begins on that date in 1300.  See the
note to ^Inferno~ I.1.  That Cacciaguida includes a noticeably Latin
word among his other words probably seals the case against his being
presented as having spoken in Latin.  See the note to verse 33.

	|37-39.~  "'This fire (Mars) came 580 times to its Lion, to be
rekindled under its paw.'  Between the Conception -- the beginning of
the year 1 -- and the birth of Cacciaguida, Mars returned 580 times to
the constellation of Leo, which, being of like disposition to Mars,
reinforces the influence of that planet.  As Mars completes its
revolution in 687 days, we shall get the year of Cacciaguida's birth by
multiplying 687 by 580 and dividing by 365: 1091.  He was therefore 56
when he followed the crusade, having lived from 1091 to 1147.  Cf.
Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 {1903}], III, 59-60).  G. Federzoni, "In quale
anno nacque Cacciaguida?" in ^Fanfulla della Domenica~, 22 Nov., 1914
(XXXVI, no. 39), would adopt a reading ^tre~ for ^trenta~, as Pietro
Alighieri and some others did, giving ^fiate~ three syllables as usual,
and thus would get a date 1106 instead of 1091" (Grandgent, comm. to
vv. 37-39).  The variant ^tre~ has now mainly been dismissed from the
discussion, perhaps as a result of Lombardi's strong opposition (comm.
to vv. 34-39), which even countered the opinion put forward by the
Accademia della Crusca.

See Guy Raffa ("Enigmatic 56: Cicero's Scipio and Dante's Cacciaguida,"
^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992]: 129-31) for Dante's supposed manipulations
of Cicero's ^Somnium Scipionis~ (II.12), the riddling numerical
prophecy of the younger Scipio's defense of the Republic or, perhaps,
of his death when he will have attained the age of 56, the age of
Cacciaguida at ^his~ death.

	|40-42.~  Here is John Carroll (comm. to vv. 40-45) clearing up this
difficult passage: "The use of the word ^sesto~ by Cacciaguida is,
strictly speaking, an anachronism.  It is proper to a later time when
the city was much larger, was enclosed in a second line of walls, and
was divided into ^six~ wards or ^sestieri~.  The smaller city of
Cacciaguida's day lay within the first wall, and was divided into
^four~ wards -- ^quartieri~, formed by a line of streets running from
the ancient Porta del Duomo on the north to the Ponte Vecchio on the
south, and crossed by another line from east to west, running through
the Mercato Vecchio, now demolished to make way for the hideous Piazza
Vittorio Emanuele.  The ^quartiere~ in which the house of his ancestors
stood was that named after the eastern gate, Porta San Piero.  An
annual game was run on June 24, the day of the patron saint of the city
[John the Baptist], and, as its course was from west to east, this
quarter was the last the competitors reached.  And what Cacciaguida
says is that the house in which he and his forefathers were born stood
just at the point where the runners entered this last quarter of the
city.  This would localize it in the Via degli Speziali which runs off
the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele towards the Corso,..."

	|42.~  Elements in this canto, including the reference to the annual
^palio~, the race around the inner routes traversing the city, remind
some readers of Brunetto Latini (^Inf~. XV.121-124).  As the
civic/political figure closest to the center of ^Inferno~, he seems to
have a certain similar placement and function both to Marco Lombardo
(^Purg~. XVI) and to Cacciaguida (^Par~. XV-XVII).  To most, Brunetto
seems a failed version of Dante's "father," at least when he is
compared to his actual great-great-grandfather.  However, for his
convergence with (rather than opposition to) Cacciaguida, see Guy Raffa
(^Divine Dialectic: Dante's Incarnational Poetry~ [Toronto: Toronto
University Press, 2000], pp. 187-94); in his view Brunetto has the role
of ^figura~ to Cacciaguida's antitype.

	|43-45.~  A series of debates has followed this tercet.  Nonetheless,
the context offered by the opening of the canto, where the protagonist
is portrayed as glorying in his ancestry and is cautioned by Beatrice's
smile against so doing, perhaps offers us all we need to know to
unravel this skein.  Cacciaguida will not feed his
great-great-grandson's pride by narrating his heroic noble past, which
may be traced back to the Romans.  This is the sense offered by
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 45), who sensibly go on to explain that in
fact necessity lies behind the author's reticence: No one knows (or
perhaps ever knew) the family history that is supposedly here
suppressed in the service of modesty.

	|46-48.~  Answering the protagonist's third question, Cacciaguida
leaves us in a quandary because his response is not clear.  The males
of "draft age" (as we would say today) in early-twelfth-century
Florence were 20% of (a) the entire population in 1300 or (b) the males
of draft age in 1300.  The Italian would clearly (as our translation
suggests) indicate that the first is what is meant.  Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to verse 48) point out that Villani (^Cron~. VIII.39) states
that in 1300 the population of Florence was greater than 30,000; does
that mean that two hundred years earlier those capable of bearing arms
numbered 6,000?  This seems a high figure, causing some (e.g.,
Singleton [comm. to verse 48]) to suggest that two hundred years
earlier that figure was ca. 2,000.  See the note to vv. 67-72.

	|47.~  "Between Mars and the Baptist" is a way of describing the
confines of the city in Cacciaguida's day by its northernmost and
southernmost monuments within the original walls (the Baptistry and the
statue of Mars at the Ponte Vecchio).

	|50.~  These three small towns are today known as Campi Bizenzio (the
nearest), Figline, and Certaldo (the farthest away from Florence;
Boccaccio was born there in 1313).  Readers have assumed that, in his
choices, Dante expected local readers in the fourteenth century to
recognize certain families that had recently arrived from these towns
and associated themselves with nefarious activities.

	|51.~  Cacciaguida is referring to the "unmixed" (i.e., Roman and pure)
blood of the original inhabitants, pure in even the least artisan and
not yet diluted by the bad bloodlines of those descended from the
Fiesolans -- or from those even worse.

	|52-57.~  Cacciaguida is of the opinion that the quality of urban life
would have been much improved had these new folk kept outside the
boundaries north (Trespiano) and south (Galluzzo).  However, they
instead entered the city, bringing with them the "stench" of men like
Baldo d'Aguglione and Fazio da Signa, both of whom, renegade White
Guelphs, were involved in the "exile question" during Dante's attempts
to return to Florence and both of whom were also opposed to the city's
welcoming Henry VII.  In short, each was a personal and political enemy
of Dante.

	|58-66.~  See Tozer's paraphrase of this passage (comm. to verse 58):
"If the clergy had not set themselves in opposition to the Imperial
power, there would not have been those feuds between the small Italian
towns, which ruined them, and caused their inhabitants to take refuge
in Florence, where they became traders."  For a more developed
consideration, also in English, of the political situation referred to
in these lines, see Carroll's commentary to them.

	|59.~  There soon results a linguistic "family resemblance" between the
emperor and Dante (see ^Par~. XVII.47), to both of whom the city
behaves like a cruel stepmother ^(noverca)~.

	|61-63.~  Ever since Grandgent (comm. to verse 61, referring to two
contemporary Italian sources), there has been a tradition among
commentators to assign an identity to this exiled family from Semifonte
(a town conquered and "colonized" by Florence in 1202), that of Lippo
Velluti.  One of the things that makes this hypothesis especially
attractive is that Lippo was instrumental in sending Giano della Bella
(see vv. 131-132), author of the ^Ordinamenti di Giustizia~ (1293),
into exile.  Dante, like Giano, was a prior of Florence and shared with
him a noble bloodline (at least Dante may have sensed a similarity in
this regard) as well as a deep distrust of the great noble houses,
which abused their powers easily and often.  Giano's ^Ordinamenti~
placed severe limits on their ability to do so.  While neither Lippo
nor Giano is mentioned by name, their antagonistic relationship may
help unriddle the references in this passage as well as in the later
one.

	|64-66.~  Continuing in the same vein, Cacciaguida argues that the
Conti Guidi, the Cerchi, and the Buondelmonti (about whom we shall hear
more at the end of this canto) all would have been better off had they
not become Florentine citizens, staying in their original homes outside
the city.

	|67-72.~  The mixing of peoples, like overeating, ruins a city, with
the result that it becomes too large and too cumbersome.  Its resulting
unwieldiness is compared to that of a bull or of a superfluity of
swords in the hand of a swordsman.  This last is perhaps meant to
mirror the 500% growth in Florence's population referred to in verse 48
(if it was to so great an increase that Dante was there referring [see
the note to vv. 46-48]).

	|73-81.~  Two Roman cities, Luni (near Carrara) and Urbisaglia (near
Macerata), had fallen into ruins well before Dante's time and remained
in that condition.  Two others, Chiusi (near Siena) and Senigallia
(near Ancona), seemed to be suffering a similar fate.  If cities show
such mortal tendencies, reflects Cacciaguida, how much more subject to
mortality are mere families?  This unhappy thought leads toward the
death-list of the great Florentine families that will occupy much of
the rest of the canto.

	|82-87.~  Introduced by a simile (as the Moon causes tidal change that
variously inundates and lays bare litoral planes, so the goddess
Fortune does with Florence), Cacciaguida's task will be the recording
of the great families who are dying out and whose remembrance is also
growing faint.  His purpose is to rescue their fame from "the dark
backward and abysm of time."

	|88-139.~  The catalogue of once-great families of Florence includes
the following, arranged here in groups of five [with those referred to
by periphrasis in square brackets] and numbering forty: |Ughi,
Catellini, Filippi, Greci, Ormanni~; |Alberichi, dell'Arca, della
Sannella, Soldanieri, Ardinghi~; |Bostichi, Ravignani~ (the noble and
ancient family of Bellincion Berti [^Par~. XV.112], mentioned with the
later-arriving Conti Guidi and with those who took their name from the
first Bellincione), |della Pressa, Galigaio~, |[Pigli]~ ("the stripe of
fur"); |Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti, Barucci, Galli~; |[Chiaramontesi]~
("those who blush because of the bushel"), |[Donati]~ ("from which the
Calfucci sprang"), |Sizii, Arrigucci, [Uberti]~ ("those now undone by
pride"); |[Lamberti]~ ("balls of gold"), |[Visdomini]~ ("the fathers"),
|[Tosinghi]~ ("the fathers"), |[Adimari]~ ("the proud and insolent
race"), |Caponsacchi~; |Giudi, Infangati, della Pera~ (the Peruzzi?),
the |Baron~ (Hugh of Brandenburg), |Gualterotti~; |Importuni~,
|[Buondelmonti]~ ("new neighbors"),| [Amidei]~ ("the house that is the
wellspring of your tears"), |[Gherardini], [Uccellini]~ (these last two
are referred to as "allies" of the Amidei).

"Il XVI @e quasi tutto una cronaca irta di puri nomi, ed @e la pi@u
lunga e pi@u arida pagina di cronaca di tutto il poema" (Canto XVI is
nearly entirely a chronicle bristling with mere names; it is the
longest and most arid page of chronicle in the entire poem [Momigliano,
comm. to vv. 22-27]).  Momigliano's judgment is, if more harsh than
most, not atypical.  Not only does it miss the aesthetic point of the
catalogue of families (which might be compared to Homer's masterful
catalogue of ships in ^Iliad~ II -- if it cannot hope to rival that
first and possibly best of literary catalogues), it severely overstates
its length: not "quasi tutto una cronaca irta di puri nomi," but only a
little over one-third of the canto, occupying verses 88-139.

For praise of the nostalgic poetic quality of ^Paradiso~ XVI, so
roundly criticized by so many readers precisely for its unpoetic
qualities, see Porena's first endnote in his commentary to this canto
(appended to his comm. to verse 154 in the DDP).  Porena's view is
tantamount to a "complete reevaluation," according to Febo Allevi
("Canto XVI," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M.
Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 540).

	|94-99.~  Carroll: "[These lines] refer to the Cerchi (see note [in
Carroll's comm. to vv. 58- 66]).  Their houses were above the Porta San
Piero, and had been acquired by this wealthy family from the Conti
Guidi, who sprang from the ancient house of the Ravignani, the head of
which was the Bellincion Berti of ^Par.~ XV.112.  The ^fellonia~ or
treason charged against the Cerchi seems to be their failure as leaders
of the Whites to defend the city against the Blacks in Nov. 1301.  Dino
Compagni says 'their hearts failed them through cowardice': the Priors
gave them orders to prepare for defense and urged them 'to play the
man.'  But 'from avarice' they refused to pay the hired troops, made
practically no preparations, and so handed over the city to six
terrible days of outrage and pillage.  The exile of the Whites which
followed is the 'lightening of the barque' to which Dante refers in
line 96.  For a full account of this disastrous struggle between the
Bianchi and the Neri, see Dino Compagni's ^Chronicle~, Bk. II, and
Villani's, VIII.38-49."

These six lines have been the cause of a certain confusion and of
considerable debate; Carroll's view, however, seems sensible.  For an
English translation of Dino Compagni's chronicles of Florence in
Dante's time, written by one of his contemporaries, see Compagni
(Boorstein, Daniel E., tr., ^Dino Compagni's Chronicle of Florence~
[Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986]).

	|101-102.~  As knights, members of the Galigaio family had, as their
emblem, the gilded hilt and handle of a sword.

	|103.~  The Pigli had a stripe of squirrel-fur on a red field as their
insignia.

	|105.~  For Dante's earlier reference to corrupt procedures in
Florentine weights and measures, see ^Purgatorio~ XII.105 and the last
paragraph in the note to XII.100-108.

	|109-111.~  Carroll: "Those 'undone by their pride' are the Uberti, the
great Ghibelline family, banished in 1258, and never allowed to return.
 Farinata, who saved Florence after Montaperti (1260), belonged to it
(^Inf.~ X.22 ff.).  The other family, referred to by its coat of arms,
the 'balls of gold,' is the Lamberti.  To it belonged Mosca, whose
famous phrase, ^Cosa fatta capo ha~, sealed Buondelmonte's fate -- and
his own (^Inf.~ XXVIII.103 ff.)."

	|112-114.~  Carroll: "The reference is to the Tosinghi and the
Visdomini, whom Villani (IV.10) calls 'patrons and defenders of the
Bishopric.'  During a vacancy, they enjoyed the use of the Bishop's
palace until a successor was appointed, and apparently they did not
spare the larder."

	|115-120.~  Carroll: "A bitter stroke at the Adimari, -- dragons to the
timid, but to men with teeth or purse, lambs.  Dante's bitterness is
not unnatural when we remember that, according to early commentators,
one of this family, Boccaccino, gained possession of the poet's
property, and therefore opposed strenuously his recall from exile.
This might account also for his scorn of Filippo Argenti (^Inf.~
VIII.31-64), who belonged to a branch of the Adimari."

The wife of Ubertino Donati, a member of the twenty-second family
referred to in Cacciaguida's social registry of ancient Florence, was a
daughter of Bellincion Berti; Ubertino was displeased when Bellincione,
his father-in-law, arranged for the marriage of another of his
daughters to a member of the Adimari clan, thus making Ubertino their
kinsman.

	|124-126.~  Carroll: "That one of the gates of 'the small circuit' --
the first city-wall -- viz., the Porta Peruzza, was named after the
Della Pera family might seem incredible for various reasons that have
been suggested: (a) how small the circuit must have been when this was
one of the city-gates; or (b) how free of jealousy ancient Florence
must have been when one of its gates was named after a private family;
or (c) how hard to believe that a family so forgotten now was so
ancient that a gate in the earliest circuit of walls was named after
it.  The drift of the comments on the other families favours the last
interpretation."

	|127-132.~  Carroll: "'The great baron' was the Marquis Hugh of
Brandenburg, viceroy in Tuscany of Otho III.  Villani says he knighted
five Florentine families, who for love of him bore his arms.  One of
these, the Della Bella, is here referred to as having surrounded the
arms with a border of gold.  It was a member of this family, the famous
Giano della Bella, who in 1293 proposed the ^Ordinances of Justice~, in
order to curb the lawlessness of his own order, the nobles, and it is
probably he who is referred to as having 'joined himself with the
people.'  How the Marquis Hugh was converted, built the Badia, died on
S. Thomas' Day, and was buried in the monastery, will be found in
Villani, IV.2."

	|133-135.~  While both families, the Gualterotti and the Importuni,
were Guelph in the views of the local chroniclers (Villani, Compagni,
Malispini), according to other documents, as reported by Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to verse 133), the Gualterotti were in fact Ghibellines.
Bosco/Reggio suggest the contradiction may be explained by the diverse
political sympathies found in diverse branches of the family.

	|136-150.~  This is Cacciaguida's rueful contemplation of the wrack and
ruin caused by a single event.  Here is Carroll (comm. to ^Par.~
XIV.79-87) on this pivotal moment in the history of Florence: "The
reference is to the well-known story of the murder of Buondelmonte de'
Buondelmonti in 1215 [1216].  This young nobleman was betrothed to a
lady of the Amidei family, but forsook her for a daughter of the house
of the Donati.  The kinsmen of the insulted lady waylaid and slew him
at the foot of the statue of Mars, 'that mutilated stone,' as he rode
into the city on Easter Day [Villani, ^Chron.~ V.38; Dino Compagni,
I.2].  Well for the city, says Cacciaguida, if the first time he came
to it he had been drowned in the little stream of the Ema which flows
through the Valdigreve, a little south of Florence, where his castle
lay.  The murder was generally regarded as the beginning of the feuds
of Guelphs and Ghibellines of which Dante himself was a victim;
although, as Villani admits, 'long before there were factions among the
noble citizens, and the said parties existed by reason of the strifes
and questions between the Church and the Empire' [^Chronicle~ V.38]."

	|136-138.~  The Amidei are portrayed as justly angered by the snub to
their name revealed in Buondelmonte's behavior; it is from their rage
that originated the current sorrow of the city.

	|139.~  The allies of the Amidei were the Gherardini and Uccellini
families.

	|145-147.~  It is difficult to imagine a more "operatic" or fitting
symbol of the end of the era of peace in Florence than Buondelmonte's
body, lying where it fell, at the feet of the statue of Mars, on Easter
Sunday 1216.  Mars as the pagan god of war is in this canto deployed
against the Christian militancy that typifies the crusading spirit.
See Nino Borsellino ("Sotto il segno di Marte: la cronaca del padre
antico [^Par~. XVI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 5 [1995]: 46) on the ambiguity of
the sign of Mars in this canto, representing, in different contexts,
both Heaven-approved crusading and damnable internecine broils.

	|148.~  For the question of the actual number of noble families in
Florence in the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, see Scartazzini
(comm. to vv. 59-154).  Villani (^Cron~. V.39) accounts for seventy
noble families in 1215.  (He also reports on the numbers for 1015
[^Cron~. IV.10-13].)  The discrepancies between Dante's figures and
Villani's lead Scartazzini to think that Dante is not to be relied on
for particulars of this kind.  However, in this verse Dante has
Cacciaguida say that there were more than these forty famous families
that he has mentioned flowering at that time.

	|152.~  This verse will be remembered at ^Paradiso~ XXXI.39.  See the
note to that passage.

	|153-154.~  Cacciaguida takes pride in the fact that Florence, in his
day, never lost a battle.  The image of the flag reversed upon its
staff is apparently a reference to the following practice: Members of
the victorious army would drag the losers' battle-flags upside down
over the field of combat.

In 1251 the Guelphs changed the design of the Florentine flag from a
white lily on a red field to a red lily on a white field, while the
ousted Ghibellines retained the traditional arrangement (according to
Villani, ^Cronica~, VI.43).  As William Stephany ("A Note on ^Paradiso~
XVI, 154," ^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973]: 151) points out, the original
flag mirrors Cacciaguida's situation in the fifth heaven, red Mars
quartered by a white Greek cross.

	|154.~  Denis Fachard ("Canto XVI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 231) points out that the first and last lines of this
canto, so involved with the concepts of the nobility of bloodlines and
the (at times consequent) spilling of human blood, both end with words
for blood or bleeding.
