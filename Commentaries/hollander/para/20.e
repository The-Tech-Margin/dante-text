	|1-12.~  Any aesthetic performance is likely, at moments, to leave its
observer wondering as to the motives of the performer.  For example,
here one might inquire why Dante did not decide to make this already
highly wrought passage a perfectly turned simile.  It has all the
requisite elements, lacking only the initial ^Come~ (Just as) and the
pivotal ^cos@i~ (so) at the beginning of the seventh verse.  As has
been pointed out several times now, Dante seems to like to employ rigid
categories loosely, as though exploring the boundaries of established
forms.  For instance, we may find ourselves wondering whether the
presence of the designative terms of compared likeness is necessary to
establish the trope.  With regard to the classical simile, it almost
seems as though he had decided to ring the changes on an established
form as frequently as he could.  See the notes to ^Purgatorio~
XXVII.76-87; ^Paradiso~ XIV.19-24 and XIV.118-123.

The Eagle has stopped speaking as a corporate entity.  That allows the
individual voices of this particular collective of the saved to speak
as themselves.  Had their actual words been recorded here, it probably
would have been clear, as it is when they speak as themselves at the
end of the canto, that their descriptor for themselves is "we" (verse
134) and not "I" (verse 31).  In simile, they are like the shining of
the stars after the sun has left the sky (in Dante's further
comparison, once the Eagle's beak has gone silent).

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1-6) point out that this is one of fourteen
cantos in the poem that begin with astronomical detailing (^Inf~.
XXIV.1-3; ^Purg~. II.1-9, IX.1-9, XV.1-9, XIX.1-6, XXV.1-3, XXVII.1-6,
XXX.1-6; ^Par~. VIII.1-3, X.1-21, XIII.1-24, here, XXIX.1-6, XXX.1-9).

	|1-6.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), pp. 88-89,
while making a quite different point, helps one to observe a curious
phenomenon: the poet has not mentioned the Sun by its name since the
protagonist first entered it (^Par~. X.41 and ^Par~. X.48).  Now he
uses paraphrase or reference (^colui~ [verse 1], ^lui~ [verse 4], ^una
[stella]~ [verse 6]) to refer to the Sun (while, Aversano might have
gone on to point out, he does use the letters that spell "sun," ^sol~,
as the adverb "only" in verse 4 [and again in verse 15]).  On this last
point see Giuseppe Antonio Camerino ("^Paradiso~ XX," ^L'Alighieri~ 6
[1995]: 47).

	|6.~  According to Dante's astronomy, stars did not glow with their own
energy, but derived their light from the Sun (see ^Conv~. III.xii.7):
"... il sole.  Lo quale di sensibile luce s$e prima e poi tutte le
corpora celestiali e [le] elementali allumina" (the Sun, which
illuminates with perceptible light first itself and then all the
celestial and elemental bodies [tr. R. Lansing]).

	|8.~  The "emblem of the world" is the Eagle, symbol of universal
empire, the ideal that Dante embraced so warmly in his ^Monarchia~.

	|13-15.~  The poet apostrophizes the love emanating from these
spirits, wreathed in "smiles": How ardent did this love appear in those
"pipes" (or in those "flames" [there is much debate in the commentaries
over this choice]) that were so full of holy thoughts!	As Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to verse 14) point out, the word ^flaillo~ is an absolute hapax,
meaning that this is its unique appearance, not only in the ^Commedia~,
not only in all the works of Dante, but in the history of the Italian
language.  In their opinion, there is no way to decide between the two
possible meanings, "flute" (see French ^flavel~) or "flame" (from O Fr.
^flael~), since both find resonance in the surrounding context.  However,
Benvenuto states unambiguously that the reference is to sound.
 And his opinion is given further weight by the musical reference
of the simile in vv. 22-27.  For an English response in this vein,
see Tozer (comm. to vv. 13-14): "^flailli~: 'flutes,' i.e. melodious
voices.  This word, which is not found elsewhere, is derived from Lat.
^flare~, ^flatus~, through the Low Lat. ^flauta~, 'flute,' from which
came the diminutives ^flautol~, ^flaujol~ in Proven$cal, and ^flajol~
in OF, to which ^flaillo~ closely approximates; OF ^flajol,~
^flageolet~ is a further diminutive."  Others (notably, according to
Petrocchi [^Dante Alighieri: La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, ed.
G. Petrocchi {Florence: Le Lettere, 1994 [1967]}, p. 328], Antonino
Pagliaro [^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~
{Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967}, p. 579]) argue for a derivation, through
OF, from Lat. ^flacellum~, "torch."  Forced to chose (and one is),
this reader has opted for the former, since it seems clear that song
is the pre-eminent element here.  However, for an attempt to undermine
the view of E.G. Parodi (^Lingua e letteratura,~ ed. G. Folena [Venice:
Neri Pozza, 1957], pp. 273, 394), who opts for OF ^flavel~ (flute), see
Ettore Paratore ("Canto XX," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~,
dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], pp. 691-92n.).	And,
for a more recent opposing argument, see Giuseppe Antonio Camerino
("^Paradiso~ XX," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995]: 50-51).

Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 89, because
the flute is not a "noble" instrument, as is plain from its association
with Marsyas (but see the note to ^Par~. I.20-21), denies that the word
is likely to be ^flailli~, preferring ^flavilli~ (from the Latin
^flavus~, which means, he says, "piece of gold"); however, this is a
variant reading unknown in the textual history of the verse.

	|16-18.~  The silence of the souls, having left off their singing
(which Dante could not hold in mind [verse 12]), begun when the Eagle
had ceased its speech, gives way to what seems to be the rumbling sound
of a river, giving evidence of the profusion of its lofty source (it
will be the voice of the Eagle, rumbling like an organ pipe filling
with new air).  This tercet marks the beginning of the first of the two
central elements of the canto, a presentation of the souls that make up
the eye of the Eagle (vv. 16-78); the second, the Eagle's explanation
of the presence in Paradise of those who certainly appear to be pagans,
runs through vv. 79-129.

	|18.~  The phrase ^li angelici squilli~ is probably not to be
understood as the "song of the angels" (Bosco/Reggio [comm. to this
verse]), but as the "angelic songs" of the blessed.

	|19-21.~  If Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) is correct, these lines
reflect both a passage in the ^Georgics~ (I.108-110) and one in the
^Aeneid~ (XI.296-299).  The passage in Virgil's epic describes the
rumor of the many voices of the native Italians being quieted by King
Latinus's voiced decision to make peace with the invading future
Romans.  Marguerite Chiarenza ("^Paradiso~ XX," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 16-17 [1995], p. 302) makes the point that this decision
is thus in accord "with the unchangeable will of Providence."

	|22-29.~  This double simile, reflecting the fingering of two kinds of
musical instruments in order to produce varying sounds (along the neck
of a lute or at the vents of a bagpipe), describes the sound produced
from within the Eagle's neck, eventually issuing from his beak as a
series of notes (or words).

Landino (comm. to vv. 25-29) expresses his admiration for Dante's
ability, plainly visible here, to "make the impossible seem believable"
and compares him to Ovid in this respect.

	|30.~  The Eagle uttered words that Dante, once more reverting to the
image of his scribal role, wrote down upon his heart.  See the notes to
^Purgatorio~ XXIV.55-63; ^Paradiso~ V.85, X.27, and X.109-114; and see ^Par.~ XVIII.85-86).

	|31-33.~  The Eagle's invitation to Dante to gaze upon its eye revisits
a bit of lore already placed in evidence.  We learned that mortal
eagles are able to look into the sun without harm from ^Paradiso~
I.46-48; see the accompanying note, referring to possible sources in
Aristotle and in Brunetto Latini.

	|31.~  Returning to speech from song, the Eagle now again speaks as a
single voice.  We will hear it switch back again to the first-person
plural in its final words (see verse 134).

	|34-36.~  The Eagle now reports that the souls that form its eye (we
only see one of the two, if it in fact happens to possess more in the
way of orbs of sight than its profiled appearance as the emblem of
empire requires -- a dubious eventuality) are the greatest among the
many that give its form an aquiline shape.

	|37-72.~  The Eagle's thirty-six verses in six segments, each of six
lines, and each involving use of anaphora (the phrase ^ora conosce~),
identify the six "chiefs" of justice: David, Trajan, Hezekiah,
Constantine, William the Good, and Ripheus (their fame is at first
insisted on when the first four of them are named only by
circumlocution; the last two understandably require more assistance).
It seems possible that the poet wanted us to reflect that the
thirty-six lines in praise of these half dozen dead rulers mirror, if
adversely, the twenty-seven verses, also marked by anaphora, describing
the dozen defective living rulers in the preceding canto, ^Paradiso~
XIX.115-141.

The number of these just rulers [six] may also be meant to put us in
mind of the six "world-historical" emperors presented in ^Par~. VI:
Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Titus, Justinian, and Charlemagne.
Those seemed to have been significant primarily for the events over
which they presided; these, for their personal justness.  That
distinction may or may not explain their appearing here (only
temporarily, we at times may struggle to remember) in a higher heaven.
Dante never gives us the grounds on which to establish the relative
advancement of the blessed in the Empyrean, except for the eighteen
souls whom we are allowed to see in ^Paradiso~ XXXII; and none of these
saved rulers is seen among them.

	|37-39.~  The first of these most just among just rulers is David, in
the ^Commedia~ most honored as the singer of the Holy Spirit (as are
also all his companions in the Eagle: see ^Par~. XIX.101).  (David is
prominently mentioned in ^Purg~. X.65 [and see the appended note];
^Par~. XXV.71-72 and XXXII.11-12).  He is, in fact, the figure from the
Old Testament most present in Dante's work, (Toynbee, ^Concise Dante
Dictionary~, "David"), referred to perhaps fifty times in all.
For his service to the Lord in transporting the Ark of the Covenant,
see ^Purgatorio~ X.55-69.

	|40-42.~  Some think the words ^suo consiglio~ (his own thought) refer
to the "thought" of the Holy Spirit; most, to that of David (as is
reflected in our translation).

The question of the "merit" of David's song disturbs some readers.
See, for instance, Tozer (comm. to vv. 40-42), pointing out that David
could benefit only insofar as his song proceeded from his own free will
(and thus was not the effect of inspiration, in which case it would
not, as the text suggests, in itself make him worthy of salvation).
However, is David's worthiness not similar to the unexpressed claim for
his own "merit" that Dante might have considered most convincing?  He
presents himself as the "new David" from the outset (see ^Inf~. I.65),
that is, as a man directly inspired by God to lift his eyes from
worldly distraction.  In Dante's mind, there does not seem to be any
limitation on the freedom of his will imposed thereby.

	|43-48.~  Trajan, the Roman emperor (A.D. 98-117), is closest to the
Eagle's beak in the semicircle that describes the "eyebrow," as it
were, above David, located as the pupil of the eye.  For his humble
service to the widow and the tradition of his salvation, see
^Purgatorio~ X.73-93 and the appended note.  For some of the twists and
turns in the history of the accounts of the salvation of Trajan, see
Picone ("Canto XX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp.
313-19).

Now Trajan appreciates, both by now being here with God and by having
been in Limbo, the cost of not following Christ.

	|48.~  For the phrase ^dolce vita~ (sweet life), see the note to
^Paradiso~ IV.35.

	|49-51.~   Hezekiah, a king of Judah in the seventh century B.C., was a
just monarch, according to the Bible, at least in his own accountancy
(see II Kings 20:3 [IV Kings in the Vulgate]).

His tears (but were they shed in penitence?) are found in Isaiah 38:3,
as was first noted by Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 51).  Here is
the pertinent passage (38:1-5): "In those days Hezekiah became sick and
was at the point of death.  And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came
to him, and said to him, 'Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order,
for you shall die, you shall not recover.'  Then Hezekiah turned his
face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, and said, 'Please, O Lord,
remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole
heart, and have done what is good in your sight.'  And Hezekiah ^wept~
bitterly.  Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 'Go and say to
Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have
heard your prayer; I have seen your ^tears~.  Behold, I will add
fifteen years to your life'" (italics added).  Hezekiah in fact here
does not weep out of penitence, as Dante says he did, but the detail
that God saw his tears and then remitted his sentence of death was
perhaps enough to suggest to the poet that the king was contrite for
his sins, and not merely brokenhearted and afraid. Scartazzini (comm.
to verse 51) was apparently the first (and not Porena, whom
Bosco/Reggio [comm. to verse 51] credit for the observation) to deal
with the fact that this passage does not record his penitence, which
is, however, found in II Chronicles 32:24-26 (II Par. in the Vulgate],
a version of the narrative from a later perspective: "In those days
Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to
the Lord, and He answered him and gave him a sign.  But Hezekiah did
not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was
proud.  Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem.  But
Hezekiah ^humbled himself for the pride of his heart~, both he and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come
upon them in the days of Hezekiah" (italics added).  If Dante were not
thinking of the better known text concerning Hezekiah in Isaiah, but of
this one, then he is more or less in keeping with at least that
Scriptural view.  However, for the view that Hezekiah's penitence is
conveyed to Dante less by the text of the Bible than by a passage in
Hugh of St. Cher's ^Postilla~, see Paola Rigo ("Tra 'maligno' e
'sanguigno,'" in her ^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in Dante~
[Florence: Olschki, 1994], pp. 80-81).

Now Hezekiah knows that answered prayers are part of God's plan, rather
than representing a change in it (cf. ^Purg~. VI.28-42, where the same
question is raised about Virgil's views on this matter).  Carroll
(comm. to vv. 49-54) puts this well: "In short, what Hezekiah now knows
in Heaven is the mystery of how prayer harmonizes with and fulfils 'the
eternal judgment,' instead of being, as it seems, an alteration of it."

For Hezekiah as "type" of Dante, see A.C. Charity (^Events and Their
Afterlife: The Dialectics of Christian Typology in the Bible and Dante~
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966], p. 230) and the note to
^Inferno~ I.1.

	|52-54.~  Tozer (comm. to this tercet) paraphrases and interprets this
passage as follows: "'when a worthy prayer causes that which was
ordained for the present time to be postponed to a future time'; this
was what happened in Hezekiah's case through the postponement of his
death.  The meaning of the entire passage here is, that what God has
ordained is not changed in answer to prayer, because God has already
provided for it."

	|55-60.~  Since the spatial arrangement of the inhabitants of the
Eagle's semicircular eyebrow is not chronological, the fact that
Constantine (274-337) is the middle figure in it, and thus the highest,
takes us by surprise, given the number and vehemence of Dante's
outbursts against the Donation (e.g., ^Inf~. XIX.115-117, ^Purg~.
XXXII.124-129; and see ^Monarchia~, which fairly seethes with them).
In this passage Dante settles for Constantine's good intent in his
governance of the Eastern empire.  However, now this emperor knows that
if the evil he unwittingly committed has not harmed him, it has
nonetheless destroyed the world.  Dante may allow him salvation, but
makes him pay for it eternally and dearly with this permanent wound in
his self-awareness.  This does not efface the glory his good intention
won him, but it does mar its beauty.

	|61-66.~  William the Good, king of (Naples and) Sicily (ruled
1166-1189), is presented as mourned by his subjects (he died young, at
thirty-five), who now must suffer the misdeeds of his two successors,
Charles of Anjou (who ruled Apulia) and Frederick II of Aragon (who
ruled Sicily itself -- see ^Par~. XIX.127-135, where these two are the
sixth and seventh unworthy rulers in that pestilential acrostic).  Now
William, who was widely celebrated in his lifetime for his lawful reign
and his generosity, knows that God loves a just king.

	|67-72.~  Ripheus is unlike the first five identified rulers in not
ever having been mentioned within a Christian context by anyone at all;
he is also the only one of them not to have been a king or an emperor.
Indeed, he is a sort of "extra," a bit player (if a heroic and probably
highborn one) in the ^Aeneid~, barely mentioned but for his death
fighting along with Aeneas (^Aen~. II.426-428; see also II.339,
II.394).  Dante does not refer to a particular good deed that he
performed, insisting instead on the general fact of his justness.  The
not inconsiderable poetic space (vv. 118-129) devoted to "explaining"
his Christian belief has never diminished readers' amazement at finding
him here.  That is not surprising, as even he is portrayed (in verse
72) as not knowing the reason for his being among the elect.  Now he
knows more of divine grace than mortals do, if not all that can be
known (we probably wonder whether this inability is peculiar to Ripheus
or is shared with all the saved).

For a recently discovered (it had been hiding in plain view for
centuries) and probable source, or at least confirmation, of Dante's
view of Ripheus, see John A. Scott ("Dante, Boezio e l'enigma di Rifeo
[^Par~. 20]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 61 [1989 {1994}]: 190-92), pointing out
that a passage in Boethius (^Cons. Phil.~ IV.6[pr].127-131) offers
several reasons to think it was in Dante's mind as he wrote this
passage: (1) that Boethius is referring to the same passage that
scholars habitually point to as Dante's source in ^Aeneid~ II seems
highly likely; (2) the Boethian context is utterly appropriate, since
it involves the surprising nature, in human eyes, of providence; (3)
the passage includes a specific reference to Lucan's Cato of Utica
(^Phars~. I.128), approving Cato's worth (even though he lost his war)
against that of Caesar, though Julius (and not Cato) was victorious
(see Dante's presentation of Cato in the first two cantos of
^Purgatorio~).  The text in question reads in part as follows (tr. W.V.
Cooper, italics added): "For, to glance at ^the depth of God's works~
with so few words as human reason is capable of comprehending, I say
that what you think to be most fair and most conducive to ^justice~'s
preservation, that appears ^different to an all-seeing Providence~.
Has not our fellow-philosopher ^Lucan~ told us how 'the conquering
cause did please the gods, but the conquered, ^Cato~?'"  One can only
imagine how Dante felt, seeing that his own radical and dangerous ideas
had some justification in no less an authority than Boethius.  For an
earlier, similar, but not quite as pointed recognition of the influence
of the ^Consolatio~ (and particularly its fourth book) on Dante's
thought here, see Marguerite Chiarenza ("Boethian Themes in Dante's
Reading of Virgil," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 3 [1983]: 25-35).
Scott's discovery should cause us to wonder at the scholarly procedures
of all of us who practice the craft of explicating our poet's work.
How is it that an important passage in a work with which we all know
Dante was deeply conversant, e.g., the Bible, the ^Aeneid~, or, in this
case, the ^Consolatio~, can avoid the attention, for nearly seven
centuries, of precisely those who have volunteered themselves as the
keepers of his flame?  Excuses are ready to hand: We are, after all,
only human, and there is so much to which we must pay attention;
further, we sometimes rule out as unthinkable precisely what Dante
happens to be thinking.  Nonetheless, our record is far from
impressive.  One ruefully supposes that our having left so much to be
redone (and done!) is, in the end, "good for business."

On the other hand, one may be excused a certain dubiety concerning the
genuineness of Dante's belief in the salvation of this pagan.  Virgil
has handed Dante the stick with which to beat him: After he calls
Ripheus the most just of the Trojans ("iustissimus"), he concludes with
the phrase "dis aliter visum" (to the gods it seemed otherwise [^Aen~.
II.428]); the muffled meaning seems to be that the gods do not care
about just humans, and "kill us for their sport" (as King Lear phrased
it).  Dante lands hard upon Virgil for this judgment: his Christian God
reverses pagan justice.  (For this view, see Hollander [^Il Virgilio
dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ {Florence: Olschki, 1983}, p.
138]; for a more conciliatory one, Bosco/Reggio, comm. to verse 68.)

As far as one can tell, the first commentator to respond to this
disturbing phrase ^(dis aliter visum)~ with a sense of its troublesome
character for a Christian reader was Carroll (comm. to vv. 67-72).  He
concludes his remarks with the following: "The most important point in
all this may be easily overlooked.  It is, I think, the transference of
the mystery from the ^justice~ of God to His ^grace~ in the salvation
of the heathen." Ettore Paratore ("Canto XX," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
p. 724) sees Dante's reference here as critical of Virgil.  Marguerite
Chiarenza ("Boethian Themes in Dante's Reading of Virgil," ^Stanford
Italian Review~ 3 [1983]: 25-35) argues well (and with greater
specificity) for Dante's deliberate attempt to discredit Virgil's view
of fate.  It seems clear that the Christian poet is motivated by a
desire to save Ripheus against his pagan author's authority, to make
him a bone of contention in his continuing brief against Virgil (and if
we haven't gotten that point before, we surely must get it now).
However, if his "seriousness" in insisting on Ripheus's presence among
the Christian just is essentially tactical and anti-Virgilian, how
serious is it strategically?  For example, did Dante ever pray to the
soul of Ripheus?  Does the poet want ^us~ to?  One is dubious, even to
the degree of sensing that the scandalous salvation is a gleeful
invention of a very naughty Dante Alighieri.  Not even Giorgio Padoan
attempted to locate the poet's view of Ripheus in some unknown and
still undiscovered Christian apologist's interpretation of the
^Aeneid~, despite the fact that Padoan was forever searching (in vain,
it would usually seem) for such "justification" as might be lent by a
"lost" Christian reading of one pagan text or another (e.g., "Il mito
di Teseo e il cristianesimo di Stazio," ^Lettere Italiane~ 11 [1959]:
432-57).  In his entry "Rifeo" (^ED~ IV [1973]), he only allows himself
the mild hope (without offering any justification for it) that possibly
Dante's text of Virgil's phrase "dis aliter visum" read differently
from ours.

Ripheus brings into focus several questions that dominate the
protagonist's concerns in this heaven: the justness of the condemnation
of the virtuous, necessarily Christ-ignorant, pagans; the possibility
that their ignorance was not total and thus not absolutely necessary;
the inability of other humans to comprehend such things.  God's justice
is definitional, and Dante, in the preceding canto, was forced, by a
very aggressive Eagle, to plead guilty to having tried to put God in
the dock.  We cannot know the grounds for God's judgment, only that
whatever He has decided is just.

Marguerite Chiarenza ("^Paradiso~ XX," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~
16-17 [1995]), pp. 304-5) puts into intelligent focus the way so much
of ^Paradiso~ XX reopens the "question of Virgil" in our minds:
"Virgil's drama is based on the contingency that he died just nineteen
years before the birth of Christ.  If God could extend Hezekiah's life
by fifteen years, why did He not extend Virgil's by little more?  It
was said that St. Paul, moved by the beauty and wisdom of Virgil's
poetry, prayed at the poet's tomb for his salvation.  (For this topic,
she adverts to the work of Domenico Comparetti [^Vergil in the Middle
Ages~, tr. E. F. M. Benecke {Hamden, Connecticut: Archon Books, 1966
[1872]}, p. 98]; Charles Till Davis [^Dante and the Idea of Rome~
{Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957}, pp. 103-4]; and Nancy Vickers
["Seeing is Believing: Gregory, Trajan, and Dante's Art," ^Dante
Studies~ 101 {1983}, p. 72].)  If God could answer Gregory's prayers
for Trajan, why did He reject the similar prayer of the great St. Paul?
 How could a minor figure in Virgil's poem have caught the attention of
God, while Virgil himself failed to?"  Whether we like it or not, we
have heard the answer to our question in the last canto, when the Eagle
came down hard upon Dante for his similar question (^Par~. XIX.79-90):
We cannot weigh God's intent, only recognize it.

On the question of God's disposition of the virtuous pagans, see
Giovanni Fallani, "salvezza dei pagani," ^ED~ IV (1973) and Picone
("Canto XX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 311-13,
and, with specific reference to Ripheus, pp. 317-20).  For the
interesting observation that Dante might have found an equally
"salvable" pagan in the person of Galaesus, also referred to by Virgil
as "iustissimus" (in ^Aeneid~ VII.536), see Giuseppe Antonio Camerino
("^Paradiso~ XX," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995]: 55-56), who sees Dante as
observing this rather striking phenomenon and considering that the two
"most just" pagans point only, again, to the inscrutable nature of
God's justice -- as well, we might want to add, as of Dante's.

Apparently first among the few to hear the echo here of the salvation
of the Roman (and thus pagan) centurion Cornelius (see Acts 10:22-23;
34-35) was Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 68-69); most recently see Aversano
(^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent
by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 91, building the evidence for
his point better than his (unacknowledged) predecessors: Cornelius the
centurion, "vir ^iustus~ et timens Deum" (a just and God-fearing man
[Acts 10:22; Aversano's italics]).  He concludes, "In patristic
exegesis this centurion is the type of the gentiles saved by the grace
of God"; Cornelius "because of his great faith and his justness,
received the gift of the Holy Spirit before he was baptized" (Aversano
is citing Rabanus Maurus for this judgment).

Marguerite Chiarenza ("Boethian Themes in Dante's Reading of Virgil,"
^Stanford Italian Review~ 3 [1983]: 25-35) "argues that we can better
understand the role of the ^Aeneid~ in the ^Comedy~ in the light of
Boethius' ^Consolatio Philosophiae~, especially Book IV.  Virgil's
stoic pessimism did not go unnoticed by Dante; Anchises cannot give
Aeneas the consolation Cacciaguida gives Dante.  Cacciaguida's prophecy
is at once the supplanting and resolution not just of previous
prophecies, but of Virgil's whole human perspective.  The pilgrim's
exile, as he fears it, is Fate in the Boethian sense, while
Cacciaguida's interpretation of that exile is a reflection of the
Boethian view of Providence.  The central example of Fate in the
^Comedy~ is the ^Aeneid~, which is reread providentially: thus, Dante
chose to save Ripheus ^because~ of Virgil's fatalistic 'dis aliter
visum' (^Aen~. II, 428).  The corrections of the ^Aeneid~ in the
^Comedy~ are not so much Christian readings superimposed on a pagan
text as Providence's readings superimposed on Fate." (This digest of
her argument is taken from the website of the Dante Society of America,
reproducing the valuable work [attended to with so much care for so
many years] of Anthony L. Pellegrini, when he was editor of its
journal.  See "American Dante Bibliography for 1983," ^Dante Studies~
102 [1984].)

Perhaps our poet was tempted to push his reading of Virgil past the
point of no return.  At any rate, that is what he has accomplished,
making the condemned author of the ^Aeneid~, alongside the similarly
Limbo-bound hero of his epic, spend their eternities in the lower world
of an afterlife they neither believed in nor deserved, while this "bit
player" enjoys the fruits of Heaven.  For him to be here, Ripheus
necessarily had to welcome Christ into his life; again, one has a
difficult time believing that Dante really thought so.  But that is
what he decided he thought.

	|69.~  Dante is aware that his treatment of Ripheus will astound at
least some of his readers.  That he wants them to couple it with his
similarly contentious insistence on Solomon's salvation (despite the
warmly contrary opinions of some "big guns" of Christian theology, none
bigger or more negative about the possibility of Solomon's salvation
than Augustine) is the opinion of Lauren Scancarelli Seem ("^Nolite
iudicare~: Dante and the Dilemma of Judgment," in ^Writers Reading
Writers: Intertextual Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Literature
in Honor of Robert Hollander~, ed. Janet Levarie Smarr [Newark:
University of Delaware Press, 2007], p. 77).  She points out that both
Solomon (^Par~. X.109) and Ripheus are the fifth lights in the shapes
that they and their colleagues have temporarily assumed in order to
display themselves to Dante, a circle and the eyebrow of an eagle, and
that both were spectacularly provocative selections for salvation.
Here are her words: "Solomon and Ripheus have a good deal more in
common than an acquaintance with them outside of Dante's text would
suggest.  Both appear in the ^Commedia~ as 'fifth lights.'  Solomon is
'^la quinta luce~' (^Par~. X.109) of the twelve that make up the first
circle of saved souls in the Sun, Ripheus is '^la quinta~ ^delle luci~'
(^Par~. XX.69) that together comprise the eye of the eagle in Jupiter.
Even more important than this parallel numerical position, both are
meant to surprise Dante's readership: Solomon because of the intense
debate as to whether he was saved or damned, and Ripheus because he is
a pagan without any patristic history of redemption who appears in the
pages of the ^Commedia~ in the most Christian of places."

	|73-78.~  The Eagle, delighted by its own report of the salvation of
Ripheus (and by the fact that not even he understands why he was
saved), is like a lark satisfied by its own song, silent in its flight,
savoring that melody in memory.  The ensuing description of the silent
emblem is not easy to decode, but it seems to refer to the Eagle
^(l'imago)~ as stamped ^(de la 'mprenta)~ by the eternal Beauty that is
God ^(l'etterno piacere)~, by whose will each thing becomes that which
it is.  In this case that last and rather puzzling general statement
probably refers most directly to Ripheus's saved soul, as the context
suggests.

This passage has understandably caused a certain amount of debate (for
a summary, see Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 76-78]).  Its key phrase ("la
'mprenta / de l'etterno piacere") either means that the Eagle bears the
imprint of God's will or is the imprint of His beauty.  Most of the
commentators, including Scartazzini, are of the first persuasion.
However, when speaking of the ^etterno piacere~ of God, Dante elsewhere
seems to refer to His everlasting beauty (see John Took [^"L'etterno
piacer": Aesthetic Ideas in Dante~ {Oxford: Clarendon, 1984}, pp.
10-11, 17-22]; and see the note to ^Par~. XVIII.16-18).  The phrase
also occurs in ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.32 and ^Paradiso~ XVIII.16.  In
addition, in ^Paradiso~ the word ^piacere~, standing alone and
referring to God, frequently seems to indicate His beauty (see ^Par~.
XXVII.95, XXXII.65, and XXXIII.33).  And so we have translated the
phrase, if gingerly, as we have.  This is a possible reading, but not a
certain one.

Beginning with Torraca (comm. to vv. 73-75), quite a few commentators
have cited a Proven$cal source, a poem by Bernart de Ventadorn, ^Can
vei la lauzeta mover~ (When I see the lark [beat its wings]); but see
the furious reaction against such "incorrect pedantry" by Porena (comm.
to vv. 73-75), insisting that the resemblances are only coincidental.

	|73.~  John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 73-78) is alert to the charming
pun available in the name of the bird (^allodetta~, lark).  He puts
Latin words into its beak: "Surge, Deum ^lauda~, iam lux est, cantat
^alauda~" ('Arise, ^praise~ God, for it is light,' sings the ^lark~
[italics added, even though John's play on words is lost in English]).

	|79-84.~  This simple comparison, less developed than a "classical"
simile, makes the heavy question within Dante evident to the souls
configuring the Eagle.  Despite knowing that, he nonetheless bursts out
in amazement and perplexity.  We may need to remind ourselves that for
eighty-five cantos the protagonist has resisted the notion that
virtuous pagans should be condemned to Hell.  Then the Eagle insisted
on that harsh truth in Canto XIX.  And now that same Eagle tells Dante
that two of the greatest souls that produce his shape are saved pagans.
 It is small wonder the protagonist is both amazed and perplexed.

	|79-81.~  Tozer (comm. to this tercet) explains the passage as follows:
"The metaphor is from coloured glass, the reference being to 'coated'
glass, i.e. white glass coated with a coloured film on one side only.
As this colour could be clearly seen through the glass, so the spirits
could look through Dante's mind, and see the doubt within it."

	|85-90.~  The Eagle, its eye more ardent, acknowledges the
protagonist's confusion and prepares to explain its causes.

	|91-93.~  Commentators, beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 91-92)
- and none who follow him give him credit, as it so very often true --
suggest the trace here of Aquinas's distinction between ^cognitio
sensitiva~ and ^cognitio intellectiva~ (^ST~ II-II, q. 8, a. 1), that
is, between knowledge based on sense perception and that based on
reason, penetrating to the true meaning of phenomena.

	|92.~  The word ^quiditate~ is a Scholastic term for "essence."

	|93.~  Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 91-92) deals with the Latinism ^prome~
as meaning "extract," "draw out," that is, as one grasps the essence of
a concept.

	|94-96.~  See Matthew 11:12: "^Regnum caelorum~ vim patitur, et
violenti rapiunt illud" (the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and
the violent bear it away [italics added]) -- in these cases at the
behest of the hopeful prayers of Pope Gregory and the ardent affection
of Ripheus.  As we will see (vv. 108, 121), the virtues of Hope and
Love will be specifically aligned with the salvations of Trajan and of
Ripheus, respectively.

	|97.~  Rhyme may have forced Dante to use a Proven$calism, ^sobranza~
(overcomes, conquers), but he seems to welcome the excuse, as his
project for the language of the ^Commedia~ is inclusive rather than
exclusive.  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (I.xi.6) he first uses the image
of the sieve (it will recur three times in the work) for the filtering
agent that accounts for a certain "purity" of the lofty style.
Montaigne's "fricasee" set to simmering, into which he throws any and
all tasty bits, seems the better image for this great poem, which
excludes nothing except incompetence.

	|98-99.~  The chiasmus ^(vince, vinta; vinta, vince)~ underlines the
power of the paradox: God wills to be conquered and thus conquers.

	|103-105.~  This tercet is built on still another chiasmus: Trajan,
Ripheus; Christ to come, Christ come.

As opposed to a more comfortable understanding, in other words, that
Trajan and (more pointedly) Ripheus had been won to the God of the
Christians through implicit faith (see Aquinas, ^ST~ II-II, q. 2, a.
7), Dante insists that he believes that we believe that they believed
explicitly in Christ, in Trajan's case (less difficult to accept, but
involving a major miracle [see vv. 106-117], after the fact; in
Ripheus's, before [see vv. 118-129]).  And so they died, not as
unbelievers, but as full-fledged Christians.  The trick here is to add
a disclaimer for Trajan (he died a Christian only when he died a
^second time~) and to swallow hard at the claim made on behalf of
Ripheus.

The feet of Jesus, transfixed to the cross by a single spike, offered
one of the most piteous physical images drawn from the Passion.  See,
for example, Bonvesin de la Riva's ^De scriptura rubra~ in his ^Libro
de le tre scritture~, vv. 153-170 (cited by Manuele Gragnolati
[^Experiencing the Afterlife~ {Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press,
2005}], pp. 95-96; and see p. 231, n. 57), where, in eighteen verses,
the word ^pei~ (Milanese dialect for "feet") occurs six times in
Bonvesin's bloody account of the Crucifixion.

	|106-117.~  The somewhat grudging authority of St. Thomas (^ST~ Suppl.,
q. 71, a. 5) sustains the widely disseminated tale that Trajan was
resuscitated by agency of Gregory's accepted prayers, believed in
Christ, was baptized, died a second time, and was received in Heaven
(see the note to ^Purg~. X.73-93).  Thomas, however, seems in fact to
have been drawn to the story of Gregory's intervention on Trajan's
behalf, referring to it in some six ^loci~ in his other works.  See the
indispensable online ^Corpus Thomisticum~
(\<a href=\"\"http://www.corpusthomisticum.org\"\"\>http://www.corpusthomisticum.org\</a\>),
the project in which Father Roberto Busa convinced IBM to become his
partner in 1946.  Busa, who happens to be a modest person, would
probably blush to hear himself described as "the father of computing
for texts in the humanities," but that is exactly what he is.

	|108.~  What is perhaps most surprising about Trajan's reward is that
it was won not by ^his~ hope, but by that of Pope Gregory.  We are
reminded of the fate of those in Limbo (where, we assume, Trajan was
first lodged), who exist (according to ^Inf~. IV.42) longing for a
better lot, if without hope for it ^(sanza speme)~.  Gregory's hope
"conquered" God on Trajan's behalf; the emperor himself, the evidence
that we gather from Limbo would seem to assert, was hopeless.

	|118-129.~  Some early commentators (e.g., Pietro di Dante [Pietro1,
comm. to these verses], John of Serravalle [comm. to vv. 31-36 and
127-129]) speak of the "baptism of fire" in those inspired by the Holy
Spirit to love God perfectly.  For Dante, Virgil's single word,
^iustissimus~, seems to have been the key for this incredible
invention.  (For the centrality of justice to Dante's design, see
the note to ^Inferno~ III.4.)  Ripheus's conversion (brought on by his
love of justice) also enjoys, in general but certainly not
specifically, the potential authority of Thomas (^ST~ II-II, q. 2, a.
7; III, q. 66, a. 11).  But see Andr$e P$ezard's perhaps over-ingenious
bypassing of the many difficulties of finding justification for Dante's
salvation of Virgil's dead warrior.  For him ("Riph$ee ou la naissance
d'un Mythe," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 25 [1979]: 5-40) Ripheus
represents a kind of answer to Adamic sinfulness, a form of Original
Justice, as it were.

To Ripheus Virgil has dedicated a total of only five lines in the
^Aeneid~; Dante doubles that (and then some) in this passage alone.

	|121.~  The word ^drittura~ is a hapax in the poem, but has a Dantean
history before it puts in its appearance here, first in ^Convivio~
(IV.xvii.6), where, as rectitude, it is an attribute of the eleventh
and final of Aristotle's moral virtues, Justice.  For the hypothesis
that Dante was planning to build the final eleven treatises of the
unfinished ^Convivio~ in such a way as to reflect each of Aristotle's
eleven moral virtues, see Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New
Haven: Yale University Press,
2001], p. 49).  (Mazzotta ["Dante and the Virtues of Exile," ^Poetics
Today~ 5 {1984}, p. 653] unaccountably makes the projected work one
treatise shorter [fourteen] than Dante did [fifteen].)  ^Drittura~ also
appears in the exilic ^canzone~, "Tre donne intorno al cor mi son
venute" (^Rime~ CIV.35), where she seems as much a despised exile from
Florence as does the poet.

	|126.~  As provocation, this detail is over the top.  Nonetheless, the
commentators are amazingly willing to accept what Dante says without
protest.  The whole story of Ripheus is nothing less than outrageous,
and now the poet tops it off by turning him, as Poletto (comm. to vv.
124-126) had the strength of mind to observe, into a sort of Trojan St.
Paul.  "Why not?" Dante seems to have thought; if he became a
Christian, he must have hated those shoddy pagan gods and the religious
practices of his fellow pagans; doesn't that makes sense?   And so
Ripheus is presented as having preached against those practices.  Is
Dante having fun with us?  And at Virgil's expense?  Perhaps.  (It
would not be the only time.)

	|127-129.~  The three ladies are obviously the three theological
virtues, whom we saw at the right wheel of the chariot of the Church
Triumphant in ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.121-129.  In what sense did they "serve
to baptize" Ripheus?  Since that ritual was not available to him, and
since he was born with original sin upon him, he required something in
its place.  Somehow he acquired the three theological virtues and these
brought him to Christ.  Dante's text here may reflect a passage in St.
Augustine's ^De doctrina christiana~ (I.xxxix.43): "Thus a man
supported by faith, hope, and charity, with an unshaken hold upon them,
does not need the Scriptures except for the instruction of others" (tr.
D.W. Robertson, Jr.).

The date of the fall of Troy was given in at least one universal
history (that of Petavius) as 1184 B.C.; citation of Petavius may be
found in a number of commentaries, beginning with Lombardi (comm. to
this tercet).

	|130-148.~  The fourth and final section of this canto addresses itself
to a question that has always troubled Christians (as is focally shown
in many of the writings of Augustine): predestination.  Reiterating
Thomas's criticism of our all-too-human desire to speculate upon the
likely salvation or damnation of our neighbors (^Par~. XIII.139-142),
the Eagle now portrays as cosmic the unknowing that surrounds God's
purpose.  Not even the immortal just souls in the Empyrean know all the
Elect (see verse 72 for the less dramatic notice of the shortness of
mortal vision in this regard).  This comes as something of a surprise,
as Torquato Tasso noted (comm. to vv. 133-135), since everything we
have previously learned about this topic would clearly seem to indicate
that the saved know, in God, all things that exist (see, ^inter alia~,
^Par~. V.4-6, VIII.85-90, IX.73-75, XV.49-51, XVII.13-18, and
XIX.28-30, as well as the notes to ^Par~. IV.16-18 and XIV.7-9);
however, Dante's enthusiasm for the subject seems to have led him into
at least a possible self-contradiction, since what is said here denies
that even the blessed can have complete knowledge of what God has in
His mind.  Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre
Dame University Press, 2005], ^passim~) argues that after the general
resurrection God's thought will be knowable by all the saved., since
the poet has created no mechanism for latter-day salvations
specifically set aside for virtuous non-Christians, though, of course,
all things are possible in God (and thus one is free to intuit the
salvation of one's favorite Martian or a particularly sympathetic
Buddhist maiden aunt).  On this vexed passage see Trottmann ("Communion
des saints et jugement dernier dans les chants XIX-XX du ^Paradis~," in
^Pour Dante: Dante et l'Apocalypse: Lectures humanistes de Dante~, ed.
Bruno Pinchard and Christian Trottmann [Paris: Champion, 2001], pp.
191-97) and Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~), pp. 162-63,
arguing that the "surprises" include not only the identity of those not
yet saved, but of some unbaptized pagans ^already~ saved.  This
argument is not on solid ground, at least not in its second
instantiation, since we assume that both Trajan and Ripheus are known
to all the blessed and that, as a result, all other "converted" pagans
must be, too.  As for its first part, Dante's apparent assertion that
the blessed do not know the identities of those not yet saved, it
certainly seems to violate the principle that whatever God knows the
saved can read in His mind, as Tasso noted.  From ^Paradiso~ XV.49-51
we have learned that Cacciaguida ^knew~ that Dante was inscribed in the
Book of Life.  And so we must wonder how thoroughly the poet held to
this apparent revision of his earlier view, as much as we must honor
it.  Such self-contradictions are only to be expected, particularly in
the work of a poet, since we can find even practitioners of supposedly
systematic theology (or philosophy) at times contradicting themselves.
If we allow even St. Thomas, a rigorist if ever there were one, an
occasional fairly clamorous denial of a previous position, we should be
aware that a poet is (or may feel himself to be) less constrained by
such demands than is a theologian or a philosopher.

Venturi (comm. to verse 135) was apparently the first commentator to
refer to part of the ^collecta~ ("collect" -- originally a short prayer
recited to Christians gathered ["collected"] for a service) known as
"the Collect for the living and the dead": "Deus, cui soli cognitus est
numerus electorum in superna felicitate locandus" (God, to whom alone
is known the number of the elect that is to be set in supernal bliss).
This prayer, once it was cited by Venturi, had a certain afterlife in
the commentators right through the nineteenth century, but for some
reason has been allowed to vanish in our time.  Nonetheless, while it
does give us an official teaching of the Church regarding the limits of
the knowledge of those in the Empyrean, it certainly is at odds with
what the poem has led us to expect, as Tasso observed.  As Carroll
(comm. to vv. 130-132) pointed out, reference to this particular
"collect" found its way to Thomas's greatest work: "In ^Summa~, I, q.
xxiii, a. 7, Aquinas says: 'Some say that out of mankind as many will
be saved as angels fell; some, as many as angels remained; some as many
as angels fell, and over and above, as many as the number of angels
created.  But it is better to say that to God alone is known the number
of the elect who are to be set in supernal bliss' (as the ^Collecta pro
vivis ac defunctis~ has it)."  The teaching embedded in this prayer
thus probably enjoyed a certain authority in Dante's eyes.

	|134.~  The Eagle once again, concluding its presence in the poem,
speaks as a plural entity, in the collective voice of the individual
souls of the just.  It seems clear that a listener cannot tell from the
quality of the speech whether the Eagle is speaking as a composite or
as a gathering of individuals except from its first-person grammatical
markers, singular or plural.

	|139-141.~  Thus were Dante's weak eyes strengthened by Justice (cf.
the Eagle's very first words at ^Par~. XIX.13, speaking in the
first-person singular: "Per esser ^giusto~ e pio" [For being just and
merciful]).

	|141.~  The phrase "soave medicina" (sweet medication) recalls the
^medicina~ of ^Inferno~ XXXI.3.  It also probably refers to the
"pestilence" the protagonist's eyes had encountered in the
counterpoised object of vision to this briefer catalogue of the justly
saved, the group of twelve damned rulers found in Canto XIX.  As Marino
Barchiesi ("Catarsi classica e 'medicina' dantesca, Dal canto XX
dell'^Inferno~," ^Letture classensi~ 4 [1973], pp. 73-74) realized, it
also recalls the "disease" of sympathy for classical divination
demonstrated by the protagonist in ^Inferno~ XX.  And, in this vein,
see Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~
[Ravenna: Longo, 1980], p. 199): "The disease which has been cured in
^Paradiso~ XX revealed its etiology in ^Inferno~ XX."

	|142-148.~  This is the final simile of the canto and of this
simile-filled heaven (there are twelve in Cantos XVIII-XX, four in
each): As a lutenist accompanies a singer, Trajan and Ripheus move
their flames, as though in accompaniment, to the Eagle's words.

The similes in the heaven of Jupiter are disposed as follows:  ^Par.
~XVIII.58-63, XVIII.64-69, XVIII.73-78, XVIII.100-105; XIX.19-21,
XIX.34-39, XIX.91-96, XIX.97-99; XX.1-12, XX.22-27, XX.73-78,
XX.142-148.

Whatever Dante's intention, the fact that the two "eyes" blinking as
one are the "Christians" Trajan and Ripheus turns these verses into one
of the most notable authorial winks in all of literature.  See
Trottmann ("Communion des saints et jugement dernier dans les chants
XIX-XX du ^Paradis~," in ^Pour Dante: Dante et l'Apocalypse: Lectures
humanistes de Dante~, ed. Bruno Pinchard and Christian Trottmann
[Paris: Champion, 2001], p. 197) for a similar suggestion.

This is perhaps the fitting context for a recognition of the
