	|1-6.~  Alison Cornish ("Planets and Angels in ^Paradiso~ XXIX: The
First Moment," ^Dante Studies~ 108 [1990]: 1-28.[repr. in ^Reading
Dante's Stars~ {New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000}, pp. 119-41])
has furnished a bravura performance on this opening simile, connecting
its consideration of a single moment separating two very different
states (balance/imbalance) to the moment separating God's creation of
the angels from that of their first choices.  See also Moevs (^The
Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2005], pp. 151-60).

	|1-3.~  Cornish begins her treatment of this moment with the following
observation: "We have no way of knowing whether the planetary
configuration that opens [this canto] describes dawn or dusk" ("Planets
and Angels in ^Paradiso~ XXIX: The First Moment," ^Dante Studies~ 108
[1990]: 1).  In the first three centuries it was a rare commentator
(but, for exceptions, see Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv. 1-12] and
Vellutello [comm. to vv. 1-9]) who did not assume that Dante presented
the Sun as being in Aries, the Moon in Libra.  After Vellutello, there
is a period in which everyone gets this "right"; in fact, among the
Italians it is only in the twentieth century with Steiner (comm. to
verse 2) that the old error returns (and is repeated by several, most
notably Momigliano [comm. to vv. 1-9] and Sapegno [comm. to vv. 1-9]
until Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 1-9] restore the better reading; but
see Chiavacci Leonardi [^Paradiso, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~
{Milan: Mondadori, 1997}, p. 797], who reverts to the discredited
interpretation).  Among Dante's English-writing commentators, however,
only Oelsner (comm. to these verses) understood that Dante leaves it
absolutely opaque as to whether it is the Sun or Moon that is in Aries
(the Ram) or in Libra (the Scales).  The reference to the Sun's being
in Aries at the Creation in the first canto of the poem (^Inf~.
I.39-40) has, understandably perhaps, been the controlling factor for
such readers.

	|1.~  For discussion of Latona's role in the poem (she is also named at
^Purg~. XX.131, ^Par~. X.67, and XXII.139), see Aversano (^Dante
daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the
author on 11 September 2001), pp. 141-42, suggesting that her maternal
role may have seemed to Dante reminiscent of Mary (in particular in her
having given birth to Apollo, treated several times as Christ [see the
notes to ^Par~. I.13-15, 13, 19, 25-27]).  He continues by suggesting
that Dante also was drawn to the figure of Latona by her exilic
condition, particularly as this was presented by Ovid (^Metam~.
VI.186-191), and by her eventual stability, shared by the former
wandering isle, Delos, in a sort of pagan version of eternal peace and
light.

	|4-6.~  The Sun and the Moon are described as being momentarily
balanced (an instant immeasurably brief because both are always in
their orbital motion); their being "out of balance" is recognized after
a certain duration, when both are perceived as having changed position,
moving away from (the one above, the other below) the horizon.
Strangely, Cornish ("Planets and Angels in ^Paradiso~ XXIX: The First
Moment," ^Dante Studies~ 108 [1990]: 7) believes that Manfredi Porena
was of the opinion that this instant also corresponds to that of a
total lunar eclipse.  Porena, in fact, first in his earlier article
("Noterelle dantesche," ^Studi romanzi~ 20 [1930]: 201-6) and then in
his commentary (to vv. 4-6), "dismisses the eclipse as an accident"
(the words are John Kleiner's [^Mismapping the Underworld: Daring and
Error in Dante's "Comedy"~ {Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994},
p. 166, n. 14]).  Porena is in polemic against those of Dante's
commentators who take his scientific lore too seriously.  He points out
that, were all the conditions of Dante's celestial moment to be
fulfilled in actuality, there would be a total eclipse of the Moon
(with the result, one might conclude, that we would not be able to see
much of that disk move at all).  Porena continues: "The vision that
Dante presents to us is thus merely hypothetical."  And he concludes:
"It is to employ an entirely erroneous method when one writes
commentary on Dante always presupposing in his astronomical gestures
true scientific rigor, even when he purposefully does not wish to make
himself a teacher of science; he is above all else a poet."  That not
only escaped Cornish's attention, it (having caught his) failed to
convince Kleiner ^(ibid.)~, who, although he understands that
"[b]ecause the orbits of sun and moon are not strictly coplanar, it is
possible for the sun and moon to occupy opposite positions in the
zodiac without an eclipse occurring.  (If this were not the case, every
'full moon' would be eclipsed.)"  That would be where some readers (and
obviously Porena) would stop.  In other words, there is absolutely no
reason to suppose Dante is ^here~ thinking of an eclipse (he clearly is
in vv. 97-102, in an altogether different context).  Kleiner, however,
continues as follows ^(ibid.)~: "What makes the balancing act an
eclipse is Dante's insistence that the planets balance themselves
^perfectly~ - i.e., are ^exactly~ opposite one another in the sky and
on the horizon" (emphasis Kleiner's).  Of course, they may only be
balanced "perfectly" and be aligned "exactly opposite" in Kleiner's
imagination; Dante does not make any such further qualification.  It is
perhaps a bit disconcerting that Kleiner continues by discussing at
some length (pp. 100-107) the three-mirrors experiment.  Following some
questionable advice, he simply assumes that Dante sets the experiment
up in such a way that we are meant to understand that it simply cannot
be performed -- a most dubious view.  (See discussion in the notes to
^Par~. II.94-105 and XXVIII.4-9.)

	|7-8.~  Some (incorrectly) believe that what is described as being of
immeasurably short duration is Beatrice's smile (see Rodney Payton
["^Paradiso~ XXIX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings
III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics {^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~,
16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995}, p.
439]): "The longer it is thought about, the smaller the exact instant
is....  How long did Beatrice smile?  How brief a moment can you
conceive?"  Payton has not digested Cornish's explanation ("Planets and
Angels in ^Paradiso~ XXIX: The First Moment," ^Dante Studies~ 108
[1990]: 6-7), not of Beatrice's smile, but of her ^silence~, which is
the issue here: "For Aristotle an instant (or the 'now,' as he called
it) is the temporal equivalent of a point on a line; yet time is no
more made up of these 'nows' than a line is composed of geometrical
points" (p. 7).  She points out that Porena before her had correctly
characterized the temporal nature of Beatrice's silence (see his comm.
to vv. 4-6) as indeed having measurable duration.  Porena suggests that
the amount of time for half the rising or setting Sun or Moon to rise
completely above or to sink completely below the horizon is a little
more than a minute, certainly a measurable time.  Cornish might have
observed that Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1-9) had supported Porena's
thesis.

	|9.~  For the poet's contrastive inner reference to Francesca's words
(^Inf~. V.132, "ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse" [still, it was a
single instant overcame us]), here and in ^Paradiso~ XXX.11, see
Hollander ("^Paradiso~ XXX," ^Studi Danteschi~ 60 [1988 {1993}]: 7-8,
nn. 18-19), citing Contini (^Un' idea di Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976],
p. 206) as having preceded him in pointing out this parallel.  But see
also James Chiampi (^Shadowy Prefaces~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1981], p. 66).
And now see Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~
[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], p. 157).  Moevs, like Swing
and Hollander, relates the moment of Francesca's "conversion" to lust
to the moment of St. Augustine's quite different conversion, as
recorded in ^Confessiones~ VIII.12.  See the note to ^Inferno~ V.138.

	|10-12.~  By now a most familiar claim of Beatrice's: She reads Dante's
thoughts in the point (God) where all space (Latin for "where": ^ubi~)
and time (Latin for "when": ^quando~) most purely and truly exist.

	|13-18.~  We are in the highest part of God's creation in time, a
mixture of form and matter, the heavens.  This sphere, we remember, is
governed by the Seraphim, the highest order of angels, dedicated to
loving God.  Dante has asked a most difficult theological question: If
God is self-sufficient, if He has no "needs," why did He bother to
create anything at all?  The answer that Beatrice offers is simplicity
itself: He created because He loves and wanted the angels to enjoy His
love in their being, loving Him in return.

For consideration of Dante's reflections on the Creation, see Patrick
Boyde (^Dante Philomythes and Philosopher: Man in the Cosmos~
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981], pp. 235-47).  On the
canto as a whole, see Bruno Nardi's ^lectura~ ("Il canto XXIX del
^Paradiso~," in his ^"Lecturae" e altri studi danteschi~, ed. Rudy
Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1990 {1960}], pp. 193-201).  For Dante's
recasting in it of the relatively anthropomorphic view of creation
found in Genesis for a more abstract and philosophical one, see Piero
Boitani ("Creazione e cadute di ^Paradiso~ XXIX," ^L'Alighieri~ 19
[2002]: 87-103).  Boitani further maintains (p. 95) that Dante's
rescripting of Genesis goes far beyond what is authorized by the Bible
in portraying the creation of the angels, a subject about which
Scripture is silent.

	|15.~  The Latin verb form ^subsisto~ is used here, as Bosco/Reggio
point out, voluntarily (Dante had used the Italian form of the noun
^substantia~ ^[sussistenza]~ at ^Paradiso~ XIII.59 and easily could
have used ^sussisto~ here, which rhymes perfectly with ^visto~ and
^acquisto~).  And so we may conclude that he wanted the Scholastic
flavor that the Latin term affords.  See verse 12, where the
parallelism with the Latin word ^ubi~ causes the reader to realize that
a perfectly usual Italian word ^quando~ is there a Latin word.

	|17.~  The Italian dative pronoun "i" (^gli~ in modern Italian) is used
some eight times in the poem, but this is the only time it refers to
God after Adam informs us that "I" was the first name that human
speakers used to address Him, and that Adam was the first to use it.
See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVI.134.

	|19-21.~  Two major issues are touched on here.  If our sense of the
history of the world begins with Creation (i.e., Genesis 1:1), what was
God doing ^before~ then?  (Attributed to St. Augustine is the retort,
"preparing a Hell for the inquisitive" [see Carroll, comm. to vv.
19-30].)  Dante's point is that whatever He was doing, He was not
lazing about, even if there was, strictly speaking, no time before the
Creation.

The second problem is of a different order.  What exactly does "God
moved upon these waters" mean?  Precisely what "waters" are referred
to?  The obvious reference is to Genesis 1:2.  The first commentator
(but hardly the last) to point to the work of Bruno Nardi was Porena
(comm. to this tercet).  Nardi had shown (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome:
Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura," 1944], pp. 307-13) that one
traditional medieval interpretation of this biblical text was that
these waters are above the rest of the heavens (the Primum Mobile was
also referred to as the "acqueous sphere").  As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to
this tercet) point out, Dante's use of the demonstrative adjective
"queste" (these) makes that solution even more attractive, since Dante
and Beatrice are currently in the Primum Mobile.

	|22-36.~  Piero Boitani ("Creazione e cadute di ^Paradiso~ XXIX,"
^L'Alighieri~ 19 [2002]: 446) adduces ^Paradiso~ VII.64-66, with its
sense of God's creation being motivated by love, as lying behind this
passage.  For the distinctions between ^forma~ and ^atto~ and between
^materia~ and ^potenza~, see Stephen Bemrose (^Dante's Angelic
Intelligences: Their Importance in the Cosmos and in Pre-Christian
Religion~ [Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1983]) and Zygmunt
Baranski's rejoinder ("Dante tra dei pagani e angeli cristiani,"
^Filologia e critica~ 9 [1984]: 298-99).

	|22-24.~  From the fourteenth century onward, commentators (e.g., the
author of the notes to the ^Commedia~ found in the Codice Cassinese
[comm. to verse 22]) have entered into the question of what exactly
Dante envisioned when he thought of "pure matter."  The author of that
early commentary resorts to Plato's term ^ylem~ ["hyle"], for
primordial matter without form, the "stuff" of the four elements to which
God would give shape in creating the physical world.  See David
O'Keeffe ("Dante's Theory of Creation," ^Revue n$eoscolastique de
philosophie~ 26 [1924], pp. 56-57) for why this is ^not~ the same as
the "prime matter" of Averro,es.  And, for a recent discussion in
English, taking issue with Nardi's various pronouncements that would
make Dante less orthodox than even he probably wanted to be perceived,
see Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2005], pp. 40-45).  For instance, Moevs
believes that Dante's ideas about ^materia puretta~ accord with
Thomas's views.

For the three entities "shot" by this "three-stringed bow," see the
note to vv. 31-36.

	|25-30.~  Dante insists on the simultaneity of all parts of God's
instantaneous creation, heavenly and sublunar.  The three elements of
that creation (pure form, mixed form and matter, and pure matter)
obviously are in hierarchical relation to one another; but their
creation occurred in the same instant.

	|26-27.~  According to Attilio Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del ^Paradiso~
[una lezione di angelologia]," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], p. 196, n. 1), this is the only time in
all his works that Dante refers to the notion in medieval physics that
light traveled at infinite velocity.

	|31-36.~  The standard gloss is found in Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these
verses), who say that the angels, "pure act" (i.e., pure form or
substance, unmodified by accidents), were created in the Empyrean; that
"pure matter" (unformed matter before God created the universe) was the
condition of the earth before the event recorded in Genesis 1:1-2; that
the nine heavens, between the Empyrean and earth, were created out of a
mixture of form and matter ("act" ^[atto]~ and "potential"
^[potenza]~).  However, for a nuanced and more complex discussion of
Dante's unique integration of elements from many sources in this
passage, orthodox (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) and unorthodox (e.g.,
Averro,es), see Attilio Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del ^Paradiso~ [una
lezione di angelologia]," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], pp. 198-200).

There is a persistent counterview, one that understands the second
aspect of the Creation differently, as humankind.  But see Poletto's
stern remonstrance (comm. to vv. 22-24).

	|31-32.~  On these lines, see Richard Kay ("Dante's Empyrean and the
Eye of God," ^Speculum~ 78 [2003]: 45): "Order and structure were
created together in the substances [= angels]."

Singleton (comm. to vv. 8-9) makes the following observation: "For a
reader unfamiliar with the standard procedure of a ^summa~ of theology,
it should perhaps be pointed out that the poem is proceeding
thematically in the opposite direction to that of a ^summa~: the
journey moves ever upwards, toward God, and here comes to a treatise on
angels, in these two cantos so near the end, whereas a ^summa~ begins
with God, in its first section of questions, and then passes to the
creation or procession of creatures from God (cf. ^Summa theol.~ I of
Thomas Aquinas as it passes from question 43 to question 44), beginning
with the highest creatures, which are the angels."

	|37-45.~  As Scripture (e.g., Genesis 1:1, Ecclesiasticus 18:1, Psalms
101:26 [102:25]) and reason (for Dante's own contribution under this
heading, see vv. 43-45) attest, God created the angels, not as St.
Jerome asseverated (in his commentary on Paul's Epistle to Titus 1:2),
many, many centuries before He created the heavens and the earth, but
simultaneously with them.  Dante's disagreement with Jerome is
confrontational and dismissive, all the more so since it issues from
the mouth of Beatrice, and we cannot lay the blame on a somewhat
intemperate protagonist.  (For the text of Thomas's far more
conciliatory packaging of his own dissent [^ST~ I, q. 61, a. 3], see
Singleton [comm. to vv. 37-39]).

	|43-45.~  Beatrice's point is that, were Jerome to have been correct,
the angels would have had nothing to do for all those centuries, since
their only task is governing the heavens.

	|43.~  This is the last appearance of the noun ^ragione~ (reason), used
thirty-one times in the poem, as though words for logical discourse had
to be absent once it entered the Empyrean.

	|46-63.~  Attilio Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del ^Paradiso~ [una lezione
di angelologia]," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1974], p. 194) locates this part of Beatrice's discourse in
Peter Lombard's discussion of the angels (^Sententiae~ I.ii.2), where
he sets out the problems to be resolved exactly as they are represented
here: "Concerning the angelic nature the following must first be
considered: when it was created, and where, and how; then what the
result was of the defection of certain of them and of the adhesion of
certain others."  Cf. Piero Boitani ("Creazione e cadute di ^Paradiso~
XXIX," ^L'Alighieri~ 19 [2002]: 452) for the same citation.

	|46-48.~  In good Scholastic style, Beatrice summarizes the first three
elements in her exposition.  See the note to vv. 46-63.

	|49-51.~  No one seems to have found a reason or a source for this
segment of time that Dante decides it took the angels to fall from the
Empyrean into Hell.  In fact, normal gravitational force, applied to
normal objects, would have left them falling a far longer time.  Their
sin, self-loving rebellion against God, occurred the moment of/after
their creation, for all intents and purposes, instantaneously.  Their
fall, traversing the entire universe to its core, took less than half a
minute.

For Bonaventure's views on the fall of the angels, see Barbara Faes de
Mottoni ("Bonaventura e la caduta degli angeli," ^Doctor seraphicus~ 38
[1991]: 97-113).   Her treatment makes no reference to Dante, but
offers a survey, centered in Bonaventure, of medieval views of angelic
free will.

	|50.~  See ^Convivio~ II.v.12 for Dante's previous handling of the
question of the fallen angels: It was about one-tenth of the whole
group who sinned and fell; God was moved to create humankind as a kind
of replacement for these ("alla quale restaurare fue l'umana natura poi
creata").

For Augustine's absolute unwillingness to consider that God created the
eventually fallen angels anything less than completely good, see Alison
Cornish ("Planets and Angels in ^Paradiso~ XXIX: The First Moment,"
^Dante Studies~ 108 [1990]: 10-14).  On the other hand, he clearly
thought that angelic nature would have come into being making choices.
And so Augustine, caught between two very strong theological
imperatives (God never created evil; Satan never enjoyed the bliss of
loving God), invented an amorphous ^mora~ (delay) between his creation
and his fall.  According to Cornish, for Augustine "the devil was not
created sinful, yet his sin was not deferred even for a split-second.
He makes the distinction that by nature the devil was good, by choice
he became evil, so that the beginning of Lucifer's being and the
beginning of his sin occurred at two separate moments.  Whether these
are logical or chronological moments is not clear" (p. 11).  Dante's
view, while never clearly stated, is probably not very different.

	|51.~  For ^suggetto~, see Stephen Bemrose (^Dante's Angelic
Intelligences: Their Importance in the Cosmos and in Pre-Christian
Religion~ [Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1983], pp. 197-201),
siding with the majority; the word refers to "terra" (earth).  See, for
instance, Lombardi's gloss (comm. to vv. 49-51), saying that earth is
^subject to~ (i.e., lies beneath) the other three elements, water, air,
and fire.  But see Mazzoni (Dante Alighieri, ^Opere minori~, vol. II
[Milan-Naples: Ricciardi, 1979 {Intro. to ^Questio~}], pp. 712-32) and
Baranski ("Dante tra dei pagani e angeli cristiani," ^Filologia e
critica~ 9 [1984]: 300), both of whom suggest that we are meant to
realize that what is under discussion is "prime matter" ^(la materia
prima)~.  And see Gary Cestaro (^Dante and the Grammar of the Nursing
Body~ [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2003], p. 248, n.
87): "Dante alludes here to the common Scholastic notion of a
^subiectum elementorum~, the primal elemental material prior to the
definition of four distinct elements, akin to Plato's ^silva~
['hyle']...."  A hedged bet is found in Oelsner's notes (comm. to vv.
49-51): "^Il suggetto dei vostri elementi~ is usually (and perhaps
rightly) taken to mean 'that one of your elements that underlies the
rest,' ^i.e.~, earth.  Compare ^Inf.~ XXXIV.121-126.  But if we take
this passage on its own merits it seems better to understand the
^substrate~ of the elements to mean the ^prima materia~ (compare
[^Par~.] II.106-108; VII.133-136, and lines 22-24 of this canto); the
elaboration of the elements being the subsequent work of the Angels and
the heavens."  The strongest case against this second interpretation
was made by Porena (comm. to vv. 49-51), pointing out that ^Inferno~
XXXIV.122-126 reveals that Dante thought that, by the time Satan had
penetrated our globe, water and earth had already been separated.
However, Chimenz (comm. to vv. 49-51) countered that argument as
follows: The words inscribed over the gate of Hell (^Inf~. III.7-8)
would seem to suggest that before the creation of Hell (and, Chimenz
insists, the contemporary creation of the angels), nothing existed
except eternal things, and thus Satan fell into unformed matter.
Nonetheless, it is certainly possible that we are meant to understand
that earth was formed while Satan was falling and (at least in part) in
order to receive him and his partners in rebellion.

	|52-57.~  The verb ^circuir~ does not suggest that the remaining
(loyal) angels are flying around the heavens freestyle, but that they
form nine angelic circlings around God, as opposed to the fallen
angels, who, along with their leader, Lucifer, are imprisoned in Hell.
The text (vv. 56-57) specifically reminds readers of their vision of
Satan at the center of the universe (^Inferno~ XXXIV.110-111).

	|58-60.~  The good angels, unlike the prideful members of their cohort,
are portrayed as "modesti" (humble), possessing the virtue opposite to
their brethren's vice of pride.

	|61-63.~  See Singleton's gloss (comm. to this tercet): "The angels who
waited for the bestowal of the higher light, the light of glory,
received that light (here termed 'grazia illuminante').  Their merit
^(merto)~ was precisely that humility and their waiting upon the Lord
to bestow that higher light.  With that bestowal they were forever
confirmed in this highest grace, and accordingly they are now bound
thereby to the good and to ^do~ the good.  They have fullness of vision
and of will, and they cannot sin.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~
I, q. 62, a. 8, resp.: 'The beatified angels cannot sin. The reason for
this is, because their beatitude consists in seeing God through His
essence.  Now, God's essence is the very essence of goodness.
Consequently the angel beholding God is disposed towards God in the
same way as anyone else not seeing God is to the common form of
goodness.  Now it is impossible for any man either to will or to do
anything except aiming at what is good; or for him to wish to turn away
from good precisely as such. Therefore the beatified angel can neither
will nor act, except as aiming towards God.  Now, whoever wills or acts
in this manner cannot sin.  Consequently the beatified angel cannot
sin.'"

	|64.~  Dante, Beatrice divines, may be wondering what the angels
actually ^did~ in order to merit illuminating grace.

	|65-66.~  See Singleton (comm. to these verses), citing Aquinas (^ST~
I, q. 62, a. 5): "As the angel is of his nature inclined to natural
perfection, so is he by merit inclined to glory.  Hence instantly after
merit the angel secured beatitude.  Now the merit of beatitude in angel
and man alike can be from merely one act; because man merits beatitude
by every act informed by charity.  Hence it remains that an angel was
beatified straightway after one act of charity."

	|70-126.~  Dante's corrosive attack on bad preaching reveals heartfelt
annoyance, probably reflecting extensive personal experience.  Tasked
with the representation of the Word, preachers should control their
desires for recognition of their powers of speaking.  On the other
hand, Beatrice is here presented as a most effective teacher.  Perhaps
we are meant to think critically of Paul's strictures on women; see
Scott (^Understanding Dante~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press,
2004], p. 181), citing I Cor. 14:34-35 for the instruction that "it is
shameful for a woman to speak in church."

	|70-81.~  Discussing the questions pertaining to the natures of angelic
language (see ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.ii.3) and memory, see Barbara
Faes de Mottoni ("Il linguaggio e la memoria dell'angelo in Dante," in
^Pour Dante: Dante et l'Apocalypse: Lectures humanistes de Dante~, ed.
Bruno Pinchard and Christian Trottmann [Paris: Champion, 2001], pp.
237-53).  Her discussion of this passage, found on pp. 243-53,
concludes (p. 253) with the assertion, difficult to fault, that the
angels, knowing everything in God, have, at least in Dante's possibly
heterodox opinions (potentially opposed to those of Peter Lombard,
Bonaventure, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas), need of neither
language nor memory.  However, see the further distinction offered by
Attilio Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del ^Paradiso~ [una lezione di
angelologia]," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1974], pp. 205-8), who suggests that, while a passage in
^Monarchia~ (I.iii.7) clearly seems to require that we conceive that
Dante there denies that the angels have memories, here the poet only
seems to assert that they do not need to make use of them.

	|70.~  See the observation of Hawkins (^Dante's Testaments: Essays in
Scriptural Imagination~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999], p.
192): With the exception of ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.79, "where 'scuola'
describes the Old Testament precursors of Christ,... [the word] always
denotes what is pagan or in some sense defective...."

	|75.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) allow that possibly Dante
believes that, projecting human experience onto the terms "intellect,"
"will," and "memory" (see verse 72), some earthly judges distort the
nature of the angelic versions of these capacities.  That would "save"
Dante from opposing some pretty potent authorities (see the note to vv.
70-81).

	|79-80.~  See Ruedi Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les la,ics~
[Fribourg: Editions Universitaires, 1996], p. 147), averring that Dante
embraces at least one heretical position of Siger de Brabant when, in
these lines, he argues, against the authorities mentioned in the note
to verses 70-81, that the angels have no memory.  For discussion, see
Luca Curti ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp.
161-62).  It seems likely that Dante wants, as is often the case, to
formulate his own position on an issue, one that accords with elements
found in several other authorities.

	|82-84.~  The explanation seems clear enough (and is found in many
early commentaries): There are those on earth who are totally confused
(i.e., they "dream" even while they are not sleeping) in believing that
the angels have need of memory, while others, those who maintain such a
view while knowing it to be false, are guilty not of ignorance but of
fraud.  These Christian sophists care more about making a splash than
seeking the truth.

Piero Boitani ("Creazione e cadute di ^Paradiso~ XXIX," ^L'Alighieri~
19 [2002]: 451) is effective in joining two responses that are rarely
seen together in the commentary tradition when he understands (1) that
the focus of Beatrice's anger is completely on the question of angelic
memory (and does not spill over into the sins of bad preachers, which
dominate the following verses [91-126], as so many allow their
discussion to do) and (2) that the zeal behind her (Dante's) insistence
is passionate and fully conscious of the famous feathers that will be
ruffled thereby, those of Saints Jerome, Augustine, and Thomas, for
starters.  However, he perhaps goes too far in asserting that Dante
^denies~ that angels have memory; the text only asserts (vv. 80-81)
that they have no ^need~ of memory, which may imply either that they
have or do not have this capacity.  Dante is obviously outraged at the
notion of angels requiring (and actually using) memory, since they live
in the eternal present.  However, whether he goes as far as Averro,es
(and Siger) in denying that they have this capacity, that question he
leaves us to wonder about.  He could not have left the issue more
ambiguous, as he obviously desired to - which may imply that he did in
fact buy into Siger's argument.

Lombardi (comm. to this tercet) was perhaps the first modern glossator
(1791) to insist that this understanding is incorrect.  Countering
those who would have Dante here denying the angels memory, he argues
that Albertus Magnus says that they indeed have such capacity, but that
it is very different from ours.  Thus, according to Lombardi, Dante, in
agreement with Albertus, has the first category of errant thinkers
asserting that angelic memory is exactly like the human kind, while the
second, in his view, makes an even graver error by denying the angels a
faculty enjoyed by humans.  This explanation does not deal with the
deliberate wrongness of these thinkers.

Dante does not seem to be denying that the angels possess a memory,
rather that they lack the need to use it, since they know everything in
the eternal present.  It is thus not clear that Dante has succumbed to
the Siren song of Siger of Brabant (who denied that angels possessed
memories [see the note to ^Par~. X.133-138]).

	|85-90.~  These two tercets form the pivot on which Beatrice's argument
turns from heavenly theology (involving the nature of angelic mind) to
religious concerns of a lower intellectual order, from the disputes of
theologians to the fables told by preachers -- and Dante almost
certainly has in mind itinerant friars.

	|91-93.~  The "cost" of the benefits of Scripture in blood (of Jesus,
the martyred apostles, and the other martyrs [see Pasquini/Quaglio,
comm. to this tercet, for these three references]) is not taken into
account.

Poletto (comm. to this tercet) at least reacts to the curious present
tense of the verb ^costa~ (costs), and "translates" it as ^cost@o~
(cost).  Grabher (comm. to this tercet) does take the present tense as
meaningful, believing that Dante is not speaking literally of the blood
of martyrs, but metaphorically -- of the inner sacrifice made by all
Christians.  This does not seem a convincing gloss.  And thus, while
the constraints of rhyme may be all the explanation one requires for
the presence of the form, the reader is forced to wonder.  Did Dante
think of the past sacrifices of the heroes of the Church as occurring
in the vivid present tense, or is his point that such sacrifices are
being made even now, in his day?  His opinions on the current condition
of the City of Man, expressed volubly throughout the poem (most
recently at ^Par~. XXVII.121-141), would seem to gainsay this second
possible explanation.

	|94-126.~  Silvio Pasquazi ("Canto XXIX," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 1031)
begins his ^lectura~ with this invective against preachers, which is a
frequent cause of complaint among less stern readers of the last
canticle.  His view is that it should be dealt with, not as aberrant,
but as of a piece with the texture and purpose of the canto.  Attilio
Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del ^Paradiso~ [una lezione di angelologia],"
^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974],  p.
209) is of a similar opinion.  For discussion of a similar discomfort
among the commentators with Beatrice's last words in the poem in the
following canto, see Hollander ("^Paradiso~ XXX," ^Studi Danteschi~ 60
[1988 {1993}]: 31-33).

	|94-96.~  Preaching as preening now becomes Beatrice's subject.  Her
insistence on the fictitious nature of this sort of public utterance is
underlined by the word ^invenzioni~ (inventing new ideas) here and
^favole~ (tales) at verse 104, ^ciance~ (idle nonsense) at verse 110,
^motti~ and ^iscede~ (buffoonery and jokes) at verse 115.  Cf. Giovanni
Boccaccio's portrait of a fiction-dealing friar, Fra Cipolla
(^Decameron~ VI.x), which probably owes more than a certain debt to
this passage.  (See Longfellow [comm. to verse 115] and Hollander
[^Boccaccio's Dante and the Shaping Force of Satire~ {Ann Arbor:
University of Michigan Press, 1997}], pp. 41-45).

	|97-102.~  For the "darkness at noon" that overspread the world during
the Crucifixion of Jesus, see Luke 23:44: "It was now about the sixth
hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
 (See also Matthew 27:45 and Mark 15:33).  And see Grandgent (comm. to
these verses): "To explain this darkness at the Crucifixion, some said
that the moon left its course to make an eclipse, others that the sun
hid its own rays.  Dionysius (^Par~. XXVIII.130) favored the first
explanation, St. Jerome the second.  Both are recorded by St. Thomas in
^Summa Theologiae~ III, q. 44, a. 2.  The second theory has the
advantage of accounting for an obscuration 'over all the land,' whereas
an ordinary eclipse would darken only a part of it."

	|100.~  This line has caused scandal.  Does Dante really want to say
that those who say that the Moon retroceded six constellations in the
Zodiac in order to blot out the Sun (and, according to Scartazzini
[comm. to this verse] and Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 97-102], some
fairly illustrious authorities, including Dionysius the Areopagite,
Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas, took this explanation seriously)
are ^liars~?  Those are strong words.  Scartazzini was the first to
point out that Dante had a precursor in such a harsh view, Petrus
Comestor (^PL~ CXCVIII.1631), who says that those who uphold such tales
"have lied" ^(mentiti sunt)~.  Eventually Nardi (^Nel mondo di Dante~
[Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura,"
1944], pp. 375-76) would also turn to this source and argue that,
despite the commentators' discomfort, both the manuscript tradition and
Petrus's harsh words underline the fact that Dante meant exactly what
he said.  We should remember the poet's harsh treatment of Jerome,
specifically mentioned as totally incorrect (Dante could have been less
direct!) in this very canto (verses 37-45); on that occasion,
concerning the dating of the creation of the angels, St. Thomas was
right (if Dante doesn't say so specifically).  And now it is ^his~ turn
to be told off, if indirectly.  Bosco/Reggio try to diminish the force
of the verb ^mentire~ in Dante's day (i.e., rather than lying, it meant
something more like "does not tell the truth").  However, ask any Dante
scholar whether he or she enjoys being told that a firmly held opinion
is erroneous.  It is the price of doing one's intellectual work in
public; and we all must be prepared to pay that price.  Nonetheless, it
is plain enough that Dante is belittling an opinion that is to be
thought of as having the same merit as the idle tales told by
not-very-well-educated friars.  And if Dionysius, Albert, or Thomas
chooses to align himself with such drivel, he gets only what he
deserves - that seems to be the poet's attitude.

Dante disposes of this "scientific" account of the miracle recorded in
three Gospels on truly experimental grounds.  If it were true, then the
resulting eclipse would have been only partial.  And so we are forced
to follow Jerome, whose miraculous "self-eclipse" of the Sun indeed was
visible in all the world, and not merely in the area around Jerusalem.

	|103-108.~  This picture of religious ceremony in the Florence of
Dante's day has its kinship with that found in the series of (often
hilarious) representations of preaching found in the ^Decameron~.  All
over the city, in parish after parish, all through the year (for this
understanding of ^per anno~, see Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv.
94-108]), the leaders of the flock trade in "wind," notions that are
clearly estranged from truth.  Such intellectual vagrancy, however,
does not excuse the individual sheep, who should realize that what they
listen to so avidly has nothing to do with the Bible or with the
fundamental truths of their religion.  In other words, they are not
innocent because they are stupid.

	|103.~  Daniello (comm. to this verse) was the first glossator to
identify the source of the nickname ^Lapo~ as Jacopo.  That ^Bindo~
derived from Ildebrando was first noted by Fanfani (in his ^Vocabulary
of Tuscan Usage~), according to Andreoli (comm. to this verse).

	|105.~  Dante's verb ^gridare~ tells all one needs to know about the
quality of mind that lies behind these "shouted" sermons.

	|106-114.~  For a sermon of St. Bernard that may be reflected in this
passage, see Rodney Payton ("^Paradiso~ XXIX," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 448-49).

	|109.~  Christ's first "congregation" was comprised of the apostles.

	|111.~  The "verace fondamento" (true foundation), that is, Jesus's
teachings as found in the Gospels (see Mark 16:15).

	|112-114.~  Some think that the phrase "le sue guance" (lit. "cheeks"
[a choice forced by rhyme?] understood as metonymic for "lips") refers
to the lips of Jesus rather than to those of the apostles.
If we choose this second alternative, as we probably should, we follow
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) and the large
majority of the commentators.  However, the estimable Francesco da Buti
(comm. to vv. 109-117) begins the tradition of treating the utterances
as coming from Christ's mouth, and has had a narrow but fairly
distinguished band of adherents (Landino, Costa, Tommaseo, Andreoli,
etc.).

	|117.~  The ^cappuccio~ (cowl) worn by friars balloons figuratively
with their pride.  Literally, a large and well-tailored cowl was the
sign of wealth of the Order and/or importance of an individual.
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 115-117) point out that the only other
^cappuccio~ found in this poem is worn by the hypocrites in Malebolge,
^Inferno~ XXIII.61.  They are attired in leaden costume that mimics the
garb of Cluniac monks.

	|118.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) point out that Satan was
often, in medieval iconography, represented as a black crow (in
contrast to the white dove that represented the Holy Spirit) and that
Dante has spoken (^Inf~. XXXIV.47) of Lucifer as an ^uccello~ (bird).

	|121-123.~  Believing in the truthfulness of pardons (and pardoners) is
the height of credulity.  It is hard to blame the trickster when his
victims almost insist on being gulled.

	|124-126.~  See Tozer's gloss on this tercet: "'[O]n this (credulity)
St. Antony fattens his pig.'  The hog which appears in pictures at the
feet of St. Antony, the Egyptian hermit [ca. 250-355], represents the
demon of sensuality which he conquered.  In the middle ages the swine
of the monks of St. Antony were allowed to feed in the streets of
cities, and were fed by devout persons (Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary
Art~, pp. 750, 751); this is what Dante refers to."  The obvious
reversal in the values of the Antonines, who became the representatives
of the vice that their founder had conquered, is apparent.

	|126.~  The friars of Antony's order are "repaying" the contributions
of their foolish flocks with counterfeit coin: meaningless pieces of
paper on which is written their forgiven sins.

	|127-129.~  Beatrice concludes her tirade with an ironic verbal
gesture, making it a mere digression.  Now let us return, she says, to
the true way, the path chosen by the loyal angels, a subject turned
aside from in verse 94 for her savage attack upon friars, difficult to
accept as a mere digression.

	|130-132.~  The numbers of the angels increases the higher they are
found.  Dante's coinage, the verb ^ingradarsi~, is found in slightly
altered form ^(digradarsi)~ in ^Paradiso~ XXX.125.  In both cases it
seems to have the meaning "to increase step-by-step."  Thus, the higher
the eyes of an observer mount, the more angels they are able to take
in.  And that number is both beyond human vocabulary and mortal
conception.

	|133-135.~  Discussing this passage, Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~
[Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 297-98) points out that Daniel's numeration
of the angels (Daniel 7:10), "a thousand thousands served him, and ten
thousand times one hundred thousand stood before him" [according to the
Vulgate]), while incalculable for most human beings, was probably a
finite number in Dante's opinion.  Similarly, the wording of verse 135,
"a particular number lies concealed" ^(determinato numero si cela)
~would clearly seem to indicate a very large but determinable number.
Most commentators think the poet is saying something quite different,
namely that the number of angels cannot be represented by ^any~ finite
number.  However, Dante's sense for mathematics may be more
sophisticated than that of his commentators; apparently he knows the
distinction between "numberless" (i.e., beyond counting because of
limited human capacity) and "infinite," a concept of which he knew at
least from the extended discussion in Aristotle's ^Physics~
(III.iv-viii).

Behind this passage, according to Attilio Mellone ("Il canto XXIX del
^Paradiso~ [una lezione di angelologia]," ^Nuove letture dantesche~,
vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], pp. 210-11), there lies a
dispute between "Aristotelians" (who propose a limited number of
angels) and the Bible (e.g., Daniel 7:10, Apoc. 5:11).  However, see
Thomas Aquinas (^ST~ I, q. 112, a. 4), as cited by Bosco/Reggio (comm.
to verse 135): "The multitude of the angels transcends any material
multitude."  It is clear what position Dante does not share, that of
the "Aristotelians," who argue for a strictly limited number (as few as
sixty).  However, whether he believes that the angels are infinite or
numbered is not entirely clear, although verse 135 may be more specific
than it is generally understood as being.  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~
[glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on
11 September 2001), p. 148, supports the second opinion, citing
Gregory's gloss on Job 25:3 from the ^Moralia~: "And if the number of
angels is finite to the eye of God [Dante's 'particular number'?], in
the human view it is infinite [Dante's 'lies concealed'?]" (^PL~
LXXV.542).

	|136-141.~  God's brilliance irradiates the angelic nature in such ways
that it is received by these creatures (^splendori~ because they
reflect the divine light [for Dante's "light physics" see the note to
^Par~. XXIII.82-84]) variously, each in accord with its capacity to
absorb and return God's love.

	|142-145.~  Seemingly infinite in its application, God's love for the
highest creatures that He made nonetheless still issues from the single
entity that made them.
