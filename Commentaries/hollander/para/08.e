	|1-12.~  The elaborate and classicizing beginning of the canto is
marked by fully six verbs in the imperfect tense (^solea~, ^raggiasse~,
^faceano~, ^onoravano~, ^dicean~, ^pigliavano~).  (For a
characterization of their effect, see Ragni's response, cited in the
note to vv. 13-15.)  This is one of the longest "single-sentence"
canto-openings up to this point in the poem, only superseded by
^Inferno~ XXIV.1-15 and tied by ^Inferno~ XXII.1-12 and XXX.1-12;
^Purgatorio~ IX,1-12 and XXX.1-12.  Later on see ^Paradiso~ XXIII.1-12,
XXV.1-12, XXVIII.1-12, XXX.1-15 (if that passage may be considered to
have a "break" after vv. 1-9); but see the "champion," ^Paradiso~
XIII.1-24.  (We need to be aware, however, that all Dantean
punctuation, absent an autograph, is the result of editorial
intervention, and always has been; thus we must look at the functional
structure of groups of ^terzine~ in our attempt to segment "units" of
his verse.)

For a listing of ^lecturae~ of this canto through 1959, see Muscetta
("Canto VIII,"  in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M.
Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 255n.).

	|2.~  Venus is "Cyprian" because she was born on the island of Cyprus.

	|3.~  Two words in this verse may benefit from closer attention.  The
verb ^raggiare~ is here used in the imperfect subjunctive, thus
connoting a certain dubiety about the pagan opinion that the planet
Venus was responsible for errors of erotic adventure.  Cf. ^Convivio~
II.vi.9: "...the rays of each heaven are the paths along which their
virtue descends [directly from the planet itself] upon these things
here below" (tr. R. Lansing).  Dante is speaking of Venus there, as he
is here.  For awareness of this connection, see Poletto (comm. to vv.
1-12).  It seems likely that, once again, Dante is undermining an
opinion put forward in ^Convivio~; his current opinion is that the
angels who govern this sphere (and not the pagan amorous divinities)
"ray down" love into human fetuses.

The concept epicycle ^(epiciclo)~, another example of ^hapax
legomenon~, was the invention of ancient astronomers because their
calculations of planetary movement, based on the belief that the earth
was the center of the universe, around which the planets revolved,
needed regularizing.  And thus all the planets except the Sun
supposedly had epicyclical movement.  Here is Tozer on the nature of
that motion (comm. to vv. 1-3): "The term 'epicycle' means a circle,
the centre of which is carried round upon another circle; cp.
^Convivio~ [II.iii.16-17].  To account for the apparent irregularities
in the orbits of the heavenly bodies which resulted from the view that
they revolved round the earth, which was stationary, Ptolemy suggested
that each planet moved in such a circle of its own in addition to the
revolution of the sphere to which it belonged.  In the case of Venus
this is called the third epicycle, because the sphere of Venus is the
third in order in the heavens."

And see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-21): "Translating all this into its
spiritual equivalent, the meaning appears to be: as Venus had one
movement round the earth and another round the Sun, so these souls had
two movements of the heart, cyclic and epicyclic, one round some
earthly centre, the other round God, of whom the Sun is the natural
symbol."

	|4-6.~  The second iteration of the word "ancient" flavors the first,
which looks innocent enough when first we notice it: "ancient peoples"
is not ordinarily a slur.  But it becomes one once it is conjoined with
"ancient error," at once represented by the slaughter of innocent
animals ("sacrifice") and nefarious vows ("votive cry").

	|7.~  Now Dante unites the pagan goddess Venus with her mother, Dione,
and her son, Cupid.  These three divinities constitute a sort of pagan
trinity: Mother, Daughter, Holy Son.

	|9.~  See ^Convivio~ IV.xxvi.8 for Dido and the promise of eventual
further reference to her in the seventh treatise, which, of course, was
never completed.  Is this Dante's fulfillment of that promise?  The
possible self-citation was pointed out by a student, Holly Hackett,
Princeton '83.

Pietro Alighieri (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 7-9) cites the Virgilian
passage, including the line (^Aen~. I.718) in which Dido's name,
accompanied by ^gremio~ (translated by Dante's ^grembo~, "lap"),
appears, a line that describes Venus's maternal ruse, placing Cupid in
Dido's lap disguised as Ascanius.

Ettore Paratore ("Il Canto VIII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989 Para.1989.1], p. 250)
points out that the presence of Dido in this canto is yet another
connection to ^Inferno~ V, such as others find revealed in vv. 32-33,
38-39, 45.  But see Pietrobono (comm. to this verse) for earlier
notice.  However, Giacalone (comm. to vv. 44-45) gives credit to Vatori
in 1920 for being in fact the first to make this particular
observation; Giacalone generally -- if only intrinsically but
nevertheless incorrectly -- gives credit to P$ezard [*b Peza.1953.1*]
for being the first to look back to ^Inf~. V from this canto).  Yet
even Paratore's observation about Dido as further connection to the
canto of Francesca and Paolo, which is presented as newly seen, had
already been made by P$ezard, p. 1491.

	|10.~  Dante "takes his start" with Venus (^la bella Ciprigna~) at
verse 2.  However, Vellutello (comm. to vv. 10-12) expands her meaning
into the familiar "two Venuses," the first earthly and carnal, the
second heavenly and spiritual.  He does not say so, but Dante is
possibly loading his phrase with a double sense, talking about both the
carnal Venus, with reference to whom he begins this canto, and his
spiritual awakening in his love for Beatrice.

	|12.~  The meaning is that the Sun courts Venus, now from behind her
(at her neck), now approaching her from the front (his attention fixed
on her brow).  The celestial phenomenon referred to is the epicyclical
movement of Venus around the Sun, in which she moves from west to east,
describing a circle around the circumference of her sphere, which, like
every planetary sphere, is itself moving in a westerly direction.  Thus
the countering motion of the planet itself, on its epicycle, takes her
from a position in which she has the Sun behind her in the morning,
when she is known as Lucifer, to one in which she has him before her in
the evening, when she is known as Hesperus.  As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to
this verse) point out, Venus is not both morning star and evening star
on the same day, a fact of which Dante is aware (^Conv~. II.ii.1).

	|13-15.~  Once again the poet allows us to wonder how the protagonist,
especially if he is in fact in the body (see ^Par~. I.99), manages to
penetrate the physical matter of the planets.  For an analysis of the
ways in which Dante's poetry assimilates difficult scientific notions
of the necessary physics, see Alison Cornish ("Getting There: the
Physics of Moral Advancement in Dante's ^Paradiso~," ^Dialoghi: Rivista
di Studi Italici~ 1 [1997]: 73-85).

Eugenio Ragni ("^Folor~, ^recta dilectio~ e ^recta politia~ nel cielo
di Venere," ^Studi latini e italiani~ 3 [1989]: 137-39) points out that
the imperfect tense used in the long opening passage (vv. 1-12) is now
replaced by the past definite as we move from the hazy distant pagan
times and into the hard-edged recent experience of the reality of the
Christian afterworld beheld by the protagonist.

It is notable that the rising into the next planet on its epicyclical
sphere is accomplished in a single tercet.  By comparison, the arrivals
in the Moon (^Par~. II.19-30) and in Mercury (^Par~. V.86-99) both take
considerably more poetic space.

	|16-30.~  The five tercets that serve as introduction to Venus are
followed by another five tercets that serve to introduce the souls of
the saved who descend from the Empyrean to greet Dante here (Charles
Martel in this canto; Cunizza, Folco, and Rahab in the next; the last
three clearly are associated with an inclination toward carnal love
that impaired their moral function, a fact that calls into question the
reasons for Charles' presence here [see the note to vv. 55-57]).

Dante employs first a double simile (vv. 16-21) and then an implicit
simile (it is one in content, if not quite in form, vv. 22-27) to
describe these souls, before reporting on what they do (vv. 28-30),
which is to sing "Hosanna."

	|17-18.~  For the difficulties in ascertaining the actual polyphonic
music Dante might have had in mind as he wrote this passage, see Denise
Heilbronn ("Contrapuntal Imagery in ^Paradiso~ VIII," ^Italian Culture~
5 [1984], pp. 42-45).

	|19.~  We observe that the term ^lucerne~ ("lamps," or "lights") has
now replaced ^ombre~ as the term for the souls of the saved.  See the
note to ^Paradiso~ III.34.  And for the two following uses of ^lucerna~
with this meaning, see ^Paradiso~ XXI.73 and XXIII.28.

	|20-21.~  Once again the speed at which a spirit moves suggests how
intensely it is capable of seeing/loving God.

	|23.~  The phrase "whether visible or not" refers to lightning
(according to Aristotle, winds made visible by ignition [Carroll, comm.
to vv. 22-26]) or windstorms (e.g., hurricanes).

	|26-27.~  Against the many commentators who believe that Dante here
refers to the Empyrean, where the Seraphim (and the other eight angelic
orders are located), Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) point out
that, yes, Dante could have been using synecdoche in order to signify
^all~ the angelic orders by naming only one, but that the blessed are
probably meant to be considered seated in the Empyrean, as we will
eventually see that they are.  And so they conclude that Dante is
referring to the Primum Mobile, governed by the Seraphim, where the
dance of the descending souls has its beginning and moves down through
the spheres (where we catch a glimpse of it here).  However, it is
possible that the majority view is correct and that Dante means to
indicate that the souls, seated in the Empyrean, begin their dance when
they leave their seats in the Rose on this unique occasion (thus muting
the objection that we never else hear of the souls in the Empyrean
doing anything but sit still in their bliss).

	|29.~  For the other occurrences of ^osanna~ (a joyous and affectionate
shout) in the poem, see the note to ^Paradiso~ VII.1.  And for the
program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to ^Paradiso~
XXI.58-60.

	|31-33.~  One of the souls (we will eventually be able to recognize him
as Charles Martel, although he is never named) comes forward to speak
for all of them.  Indeed, his opening remarks (which conclude at verse
39) are not in any way personal.  He in fact is the mouthpiece for all
those who have come down.  That will no longer be true once Dante asks
him who he is, when he has reason to personalize his response.

	|34-39.~  Charles informs Dante that here they are whirling with the
Principalities, the order of angels that governs the heaven of Venus,
which Dante had once (incorrectly) said was that of the Thrones
(^Conv~. II.v.6 and II.v.13).  He now has firsthand experience of
exactly how wrong he was.

Dante is obviously revising a previous opinion about angelology.  (For
the clarification that in ^Convivio~ he had followed the views of
Gregory the Great as found in the ^Moralia~, but here as found in his
^Homilies~, see Carlo Muscetta ["Canto VIII,"  in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan {Florence: Le Monnier, 1968},
p. 258].)  However, something far worse than a scholarly slip by an
amateur of angelic lore is probably at stake here.  The first ode of
^Convivio~, the opening verse of which is cited, specifically rejects
Beatrice in favor of Lady Philosophy.  And a good deal of energy in the
^Commedia~ is put to the task of retracting the views that reflect that
wrongful love.  Some scholars, rejecting this notion, point out that
Dante ^never~ gives over his predilection for philosophical
investigation (e.g., Scott ["The Unfinished ^Convivio~ as Pathway to
the ^Comedy~," ^Dante Studies~ 113 {1995}: 31-56], Dronke [^Dante's
Second Love: The Originality and the Contexts of the "Convivio"~
{Exeter: Society for Italian Studies, 1997}], and Scott again
[^Understanding Dante~ {Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 2004},
pp. 126-29]).  Such a view is surely correct yet may be said to miss
the point: Dante needs to separate himself from his choice of Lady
Philosophy over Beatrice, and this requires jettisoning certain of his
philosophical baggage, especially that displayed in the first decade of
the fourteenth century, i.e., not Aristotle, but perhaps Plato (author
of the ^Timaeus~) and/or the neoplatonist Proclus (see the note to
^Par~. IV.24); not Aristotle, but perhaps the "radical Aristotelians"
(see Corti [^La felicit@a mentale: nuove prospettive per Cavalcanti e
Dante~ {Turin: Einaudi, 1983}]).  There is a brief attempt to summarize
the debate in Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New Haven: Yale
University Press, 2001], pp. 88-90 and n. 108 [pp. 193-94]).  And see
the dispute between Hollander ("Dante's Deployment of ^Convivio~ in the
^Comedy~," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~
[October 1996]) and Pertile ("Lettera aperta di Lino Pertile a Robert
Hollander sui rapporti tra ^Commedia~ e ^Convivio~," ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [October 1996]).

The modern notion of a palinodic aspect in Dante's more mature view of
his earlier work, in particular ^Convivio~, featuring a certain amount
of stern remonstrance on the part of the author of the ^Commedia~
against his younger self, began perhaps with Freccero, "Casella's Song"
(1973) (reprinted in ^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel
Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986], pp. 186-94).  His
position was shared by Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and
Dante's ^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]: 348-63), Jacoff ("The
Post-Palinodic Smile: ^Paradiso~ VIII and IX," ^Dante Studies~ 98
[1980]: 111-22 [to a lesser degree]), Barolini (^Dante's Poets~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984 -- also to a lesser
degree], pp. 31-40, 57-84); and see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The
New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990]: 28-45).
In Italy this point of view has had a difficult time taking root.  It
is now forthrightly embraced by Picone ("Canto VIII," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 119-32), who lists the following
as resisting what seems to him a convincing argument: Vittorio Russo
("'Voi che 'ntendendo' e 'Amor che ne la mente': la diffrazione dei
significati secondo l'auto-commento del ^Convivio~," ^Studi Danteschi~
61 [1989]: 1-11); Ignazio Baldelli ("Linguistica e interpretazione:
l'amore di Catone, di Casella, di Carlo Martello e le canzoni del
<Convivio> II e III," in ^Miscellanea di studi linguistici in onore di
Walter Belardi~, ed. P. Cipriano, P. Di Giovine, M. Mancini, vol. II
[Rome: n. p., 1996], pp. 535-55); Giunta (^La poesia italiana nell'et@a
di Dante: la linea Bonagiunta-Guinizzelli~ [Bologna: Il Mulino, 1998],
pp. 58-62); and Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica
della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], pp. 122-48).
However, for a considerably earlier Italian understanding of the
conflict between the two Dantes, see Giovanni Federzoni (^"La Divina
Commedia" di Dante Allighieri commentata per la scuole e per gli
studiosi~ [Bologna: L. Cappelli, 1920], comm. to vv. 36-39): "The
reason for the reference to the ^canzone~ here is that the amatory
life, to which the spirits encountered in this planet offered
themselves, the Epicurean existence condemned by the austerity of the
Christian religion, is, on the contrary, justified by pagan philosophy,
the philosophy that Dante himself celebrated in the second treatise of
the ^Convivio~ and most of all in this very ^canzone~."

	|34.~  We are meant to understand ^either~ that these angelic spirits,
the Principalities, are not currently seated in the Empyrean but are,
having descended with the souls, whirling in dance with the rotation of
Venus ^or~ that they are still (and as always) whirling in the seventh
circle out from the Point that is God in the Empyrean.  If the first
condition is what we take the text as indicating, this would mark a
perhaps unique instance in which we are to envision an order of angels
as descending along with the appropriate souls to a specific sphere in
order to welcome Dante to it.  While that might seem an unlikely
understanding, we should remember that individual angels have been
portrayed as guiding saved souls to the purgatorial shore, as present
on each terrace of ^Purgatorio~ and even at the walls of Dis.  However,
it is possibly best to assume that Dante either meant (or should have
meant) us to conceive the dance of the spirits, who ^have~ descended,
as being in tune with the heavenly movement of the "celestial Princes,"
who have not.

	|37.~  The first verse of the first ^canzone~ of the ^Convivio~ is
cited here; that is beyond dispute.  But what to make of this
self-citation is the cause of some dispute (for an overview, see the
note to vv. 34-39).  The "understanding" ^(intendendo)~ that Dante is
attributing to the intelligence of the angelic host of the Thrones is
said (^Conv~. II.v.18) to move the sphere of Venus by the power of
their intellects.  That same condition would still seem to pertain,
even if the "movers" are now seen to be Principalities (and not
Thrones).  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVIII.130-135.

	|38.~  The love that fills the speaker and his companions is obviously
^caritas~, not the lust that they knew from their earthly lives.  See
the note to vv. 55-57.

	|39.~  While the literal sense of his remark is clearly that staying
still and quiet to welcome Dante will be no less sweet to them than are
their whirling dance and accompanying song, Charles' way of implicitly
reprimanding Dante for his divagation from Beatrice is courtesy itself:
"let our ^not~ singing your ode seem a favor to you."  Compare
Casella's singing of the ode from ^Convivio~ III in ^Purgatorio~ II and
Cato's rebuke.

	|40-41.~  While Dante turns to Beatrice to gain permission to pose a
question to these souls, it seems likely that he might have looked at
her to see if she is reflecting upon his disloyalty when he turned away
from her to the ^donna gentile~.  But he has been through Lethe and
himself cannot remember his fault.  But if he cannot remember, we can.
He did not behave so reverently to her memory in ^Convivio~, when, as
he tells it, after the death of Beatrice he read Boethius and Cicero
looking for consolation (silver) and, in his reacquaintance with
philosophy, found gold (^Conv~. II.xii.4): "I who sought to console
myself found not only a remedy for my tears but also the words of
authors, sciences, and books.  Pondering these, I quickly determined
that Philosophy, who was the lady of these authors, sciences, and
books, was a great thing" (tr. R. Lansing).

	|44.~  Here we find the much-debated phrase, "Deh, chi siete?" (Please,
who are you?)  Perhaps the solution is simpler than the discussion
surrounding it might indicate.  While most of the early commentators
either actually take or seem to take this plural ^voi~ as honorific, in
the sixteenth century Daniello (comm. to vv. 44-45) objected fiercely,
claiming that the text is corrupt and that he had seen another ancient
one that reads "chi se' tu?".  That reading actually began to be
printed for a time, until Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 43-44) did a minute
review of the question and settled on the original reading, "Di', chi
siete" (You [sing.], say who you [pl.] are).  The record of the debate
shows, however, that before Poletto did so in 1894 (comm. to vv.
40-45), none had made the only sensible suggestion that this is not
only the correct reading (there is much textual evidence on its side,
as Scartazzini demonstrated), but (as even Scartazzini failed to see)
more than acceptable phrasing on Dante's part and a perfectly sensible
way for the protagonist to frame his question: "You (the one to whom I
am speaking), tell who all of the rest of you are" (i.e., at least the
three others whom we will meet in the next canto).  Poletto goes on to
point out that exactly this sort of construction is found in ^Paradiso~
III.64, where Dante addresses Piccarda: "Dimmi, voi che siete qui."
Trucchi (comm. to vv. 40-45) returns to the discredited notion that
this is an honorific ^voi~ for Charles Martel, whom Dante probably
addressed in this mode in Florence, forgetting that Charles is not yet
recognized by Dante.  Currently, Petrocchi's return to a minority
reading ("Deh," and not "Di', [chi siete"]) rules, but shakily.

	|45.~  Dante's affection responds to the fondness the anonymous speaker
has shown him (see vv. 32-33, 38-39).

	|46-48.~  Dante's presence in the heavens has already been presented as
increasing the paradisiac joy of the blessed (see, for example, ^Par~.
V.105).

	|49-51.~  Charles presents himself as the good ruler, whose early death
deprived Europe of his many virtues, but also unleashed the evil of
others who came to power in his absence from the scene.  "Charles
Martel, eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Anjou and Mary, daughter
of Stephen IV (V) of Hungary; he was born in 1271; and in 1291 he
married Clemence of
Habsburg, daughter of the Emperor Rudolf I, by whom he had three
children, Charles
Robert (Carobert) (afterwards king of Hungary), Clemence (married Louis
X of France),
and Beatrice; he died at Naples in 1295 at the age of 24" (Toynbee,
"Carlo-3" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  He died, narrowly
predeceasing his wife, of the plague, although some were of the opinion
that he had been poisoned.  Dante's other great hope, for his own
political ends as well as his idealistic sense of the imperial role of
Italy, Henry VII, had died recently (24 August 1313).  That event,
dashing even Dante's unrealistic hopes for the triumph of the principle
of restored imperial leadership, probably colored his reflections about
the untimely death of Charles eighteen years earlier.

	|52-54.~  Carroll (comm. to these verses) has this to say about this
tercet: "It is a mistake to say, as is sometimes done, that this is a
mere temporary concealment due to the sudden increase of joy caused by
this meeting with his friend.  Doubtless there was this increase of
joy, and therefore of light, for Dante expressly says so (^Par.~
VIII.46-48); but from the very first he describes them as 'lamps' and
'sparks' within a flame [see the note to verse 19].  There is no
indication that at any time he saw them in their own proper forms."

	|55-57.~  Whatever fantasy Dante may have had of a better (non-exilic)
existence had Charles remained alive and a power on the peninsula, his
use of the verb ^amare~ and the noun ^amore~ in this tercet, spoken by
Charles in Venus, shows how the poet has reconceptualized the nature of
love from Dido's kind to spiritual friendship (see the note to ^Inf~.
II.61).  For an essay on the two Venuses, see Landino's proem to this
canto.  Lino Pertile ("Quale amore va in Paradiso?" in ^"Le donne, i
cavalieri, l'arme, gli amori": Poema e romanzo: la narrativa lunga in
Italia~, ed. Francesco Bruni [Venice: Marsilio, 2001], p. 60) is not
alone in objecting that Charles does not seem to be present here in the
role of lover, if Cunizza, Folchetto, and Rahab (found in the next
canto) all do.  Indeed, his lengthy self-presentation (vv. 49-84) is
exclusively political in nature.  For an attempt to link Charles and
Venus, see Patrick Boyde (^Perception and passion in Dante's "Comedy"~
[Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1993], p. 285): "Perhaps we are meant to
infer that the rays of Venus may dispose a 'gentle heart' to
disinterested friendship, as well as to ^luxuria~."  That is a
reasonable response to Dante's situation of Charles in this planet.
Nonetheless, Benvenuto da Imola portrays Charles as a "son of Venus"
(comm. to vv. 31-39): "fuit vere filius Veneris quia amorosus,
gratiosus, vagus, habens in se quinque invitantia hominem ad amorem,
scilicet, sanitatem, pulcritudinem, opulentiam, otium, et juventutem"
(...he was indeed a son of Venus, amorous, graceful, eager, possessing
five qualities that promote a man's disposition to love, i.e., good
health, physical attractiveness, wealth, leisure, and youth).

Eugenio Ragni ("^Folor~, ^recta dilectio~ e ^recta politia~ nel cielo
di Venere," ^Studi latini e italiani~ 3 [1989]: 145-52) shows that
Dante's presentation of Charles Martel accords with his presentation of
the ideal ruler in ^Monarchia~ (I.xi.6-18).

See Girolamo Arnaldi ("La maledizione del sangue e la virt@u delle
stelle: Angioini e Capetingi nella ^Commedia~ di Dante," ^La Cultura~
30 [1992]: 55-56 -- cited by Picone ["Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
{Florence: Cesati, 2002}, p. 124]) for the appealing notion that, when
Charles visited Florence in 1294, he and Dante met in the environment
of S. Maria Novella, where at this period visiting heads of state were
customarily lodged and where Dante may have also been involved.  See
his own words: "I began to go where she [Philosophy] was truly
revealed, namely to the schools of the religious orders [Dominicans at
S. Maria Novella, Franciscans at S. Croce] and to the disputations held
by the philosophers" (^Conv~. II.xii.7, tr. R. Lansing).  Thus the
context of Dante's new "love" (for the Lady Philosophy) is
understandably referred to.  It must have permeated his and Charles'
discussions at the time, as may be evidenced by Charles' reference to
the first ode of the ^Convivio~, usually dated to around this time (ca.
1293-94).

	|58-63.~  The familiar technique of locating territories by their
watery limits is employed here to identify Provence, part of the dowry
(see ^Purg~. XX.61) of Beatrice, daughter of Raymond Berenger, wife of
Charles I of Anjou, and grandmother of Charles Martel.  Upon the death
of his father, Charles II (who in fact survived him by fourteen years,
dying in 1309), he would have inherited the titles to lordship as Count
of Provence.

The second tercet points to southern Italy, where Charles would have
inherited kingship over the Kingdom of Naples (as a result of the
^Vespri siciliani~ [1282], no longer of Sicily as well): "The kingdom
of Apulia in Ausonia, or Lower Italy, embracing Bari on the Adriatic,
Gaeta in the Terra di Lavoro on the Mediterranean, and C[a]tona in
Calabria; a region bounded on the north by the Tronto emptying into the
Adriatic, and the Verde (or Garigliano) emptying into the
Mediterranean" (Longfellow's comm. to verse 61).

	|64-66.~  Charles inherited the kingship of Hungary through his mother.
 Crowned ^in absentia~ (1292), in Aix, he never exercised his rights to
rulership, a king in title only.  Hungary is farther along the Danube,
past Austrian lands ("its German banks"), to the east and south.

	|67-75.~  The fourth realm, which might have been Charles' to lose by
his untimely death had not it already been lost because of the Sicilian
Vespers (1282), was actually referred to in Dante's time by its
classical name "Trinacria" (see Bosco/Reggio, comm. to vv. 67-70),
possibly to avoid reminding people that the Kingdom of Sicily
(currently an independent entity, under the control of the House of
Aragon) used to contain the territories of Naples.

Picone ("Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
127), following Arnaldi's suggestion ("La maledizione del sangue e la
virt@u delle stelle: Angioini e Capetingi nella ^Commedia~ di Dante,"
^La Cultura~ 30 [1992]: 51, 57), thinks that Dante may here be
imagining a second cultural "golden age" in Sicily if Charles and his
heirs had only governed the island.

	|68-69.~  Pachynus and Pelorus are the ancient names for Capes Passero
and Faro, and form "arms" that stretch out at either end of the eastern
shore of Sicily (the present-day Gulf of Catania).  For Pelorus, see
the note to ^Purgatorio~ XIV.31-42.

	|70.~  ^Tifeo~ (Typhon [or Typhoeus]), also referred to by the variant
^Tifo~ (^Inf~. XXXI.124), was a hundred-headed monster who attempted to
acquire power over all creatures.  Jupiter struck him down with his
thunderbolt and buried him in Tartarus under Mt. Aetna, the eruptions
of which were supposedly due to his exertions to escape (see Ovid,
^Metamorphoses~ V.346-358, where Typhon's two hands are said to be
pilloried by Pelorus and Pachynus).  Dante dispenses with "classical
erudition" in the name of "modern science": the clouds of smoke hanging
over the area are not the result of Typhon's struggles to escape, but
of sulphur burning in the earth.  For this explanation, Tozer (comm. to
verse 72) suggests that Dante found a source in Isidore of Seville
(^Etym~. XIV.8).

	|75.~  The so-called ^Vespri siciliani~ were begun at the hour of
Vespers on Easter Monday of 1282 in Palermo.  The uprising resulted in
the French losing control, eventually, of all Sicily, which ended up
being ruled by Spain.

	|76-78.~  The debate over the most likely interpretation of these lines
goes back to the fourteenth century, one school of interpretation
insisting that the phrase "l'avara povert@a di Catalogna" (the greedy
poverty of Catalonia) refers to the Spanish courtiers who will
accompany Charles' brother Robert to Italy once he is "put on" (in
1309), the other, that it is Robert's own avarice that is worthy of a
Spaniard.  The first interpretation currently is the most favored, but
counter-arguments are presented by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet)
and Picone ("Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp.
128-29).  Picone (p. 128n.) argues that ^antivedere~ does not here have
its usual meaning ("see in advance"), but refers to a past event (a
necessary choice if one believes that the event referred to does not
lie in Robert's future).  However, see the note to vv. 79-84.  And see
Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1984], p. 65n.), documenting the three other appearances of the verb in
the poem (^Inf~. XXVIII.78; ^Purg~. XXIII.109; ^Purg~. XXIV.46).  In
all four contexts the prediction of future occurrences is the subject.

Charles' brother was a great enemy to Henry VII.  Less than a year
after Henry's death, on 15 March 1314, Pope Clement V announced
Robert's appointment as imperial vicar, a position that Henry had held.
 Robert reigned as king of Naples until 1343, long enough, that is, to
place the laurel wreath on Petrarch's head on 6 April 1341.  Dante was
spared knowledge of that coronation.  If Canto VI is about the triumphs
of Rome, this canto is concerned with political defeats, those suffered
by Charles and by Dante: Charles' death brought his brother to the
throne and into collaboration with Clement.

	|79-84.~  Robert and his "ship of state" (the Kingdom of Naples) are
already so heavily burdened with difficulties that it is in greater
danger of foundering if it is loaded with still more dead weight.
Since Robert's avarice is already "on board," that comes close to
ruling out the second interpretation of verse 77 (see the note to vv.
76-78), leaving the avarice of his Spanish followers as the better
reading.  For ^barca~ with this sense ("ship of state"), see ^Paradiso~
XVI.96.

	|82.~  This verse has long been the cause of dispute: To whom precisely
does the phrase "worthy stock" refer?  Since Charles' following
discourse centers on the differing virtues of fathers and sons (with
fathers generally getting the best of the comparisons), some suggest
that the reference here is to the otherwise despised Charles II of
Anjou, Charles Martel's father (see, e.g., Lombardi, comm. to vv.
82-84, for this view).  Tozer (comm. to vv. 82-84) finds justification
in such a reading in ^Paradiso~ XIX.128, where the elder Charles is
granted a single virtue (and thus a certain native liberality).  As
uncomfortable as it may leave one feeling, that is perhaps the best
available gloss.

	|83.~  This also is currently a disputed verse.  What is the reference
of the noun ^milizia~?  It was only in the twentieth century, with
Torraca's complex and interesting gloss (comm. to vv. 82-84), that the
possibility that the word might refer to soldiers is even broached.
All who have a previous opinion are certain that the word refers to
administrators, government officials, or the like.  We have accepted
their view for our translation ("officials").  It allows, by the way,
the understanding that the members of Robert's Spanish entourage may be
included in the group, which perhaps accounts for Bosco/Reggio's
insistence that the word refers to "mercenary soldiers" (comm. to this
verse), a reading in which they are the first.

	|85-90.~  Dante tells Charles that he is glad on two counts, first that
his royal friend knows of Dante's gladness without his needing to
express it; second that he knows of it in God, because he is saved.

	|91-93.~  Dante continues by wondering, on the basis of vv. 82-83, how
a good father can have a bad son.  See Picone ("Canto VIII," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 129-31) for
clarifying discussion of this passage and the rest of the canto, which,
he argues, relies for its basic point on a biblical text, the parable
of the sower (Matth. 13:3-23).

	|94-96.~  For the insistent presence of this image in the canto, see
the note to verse 136.

	|97-111.~  Tozer (comm. to these verses) summarizes Charles' thoughts:
"The argument is as follows: God, in creating the universe, provided
not only for the existence of things, but for their working in the most
perfect manner; and the instrumentality which He appointed for that
purpose was the stellar influences, which are directed by the angels or
Intelligences who preside over them: Were it not for these, chaos and
not order would prevail."

	|97-99.~  God sets the mark of his Providence upon his creatures, not
through his direct creation (which is reserved for the individual human
soul), but indirectly, through the stars and planets associated with
the eight lowest celestial spheres.  This arrangement maintains human
freedom of the will and yet allows God the role of ordering his
Creation, thus avoiding chaos (see verse 108).

	|100-102.~  God foresees not only the nature of the composite human
soul (not only the part that he makes directly, the rational soul, but
the animal and vegetative souls, that he helps shape indirectly, by
agency of the celestial bodies), but its ultimate perfection as it
prepares to leave its body.  The word ^salute~, as readers of the ^Vita
nuova~ (where it also puns on ^saluto~ [salutation]) will recall, is
utilized by Dante in such ways as to run the gamut from physical
"health" to more generalized "well-being" to Christian "salvation," and
it probably has polyvalent significance here.

	|103-105.~  The image of an arrow striking its mark once again meets
the reader's eyes (see ^Par~.  I.119 and V.91).  If one had to pick one
passage in the poem that might lead a reader to believe that Dante's
view of predestination verges on determinism, this tercet might be a
popular selection.  Yet, once we reflect on the way Dante has held
back, avoiding dangerous formulations in the previous tercet, we can
sense that he is both aware of the pitfall and determined to avoid it.
For the wider meaning in Dante's use of the verb ^disporre~ (verse
104), see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXX.138.

	|106-108.~  As he concludes his "lecture" on predestination, Charles
makes it clear why he has had to come so close to the shoals of
determinism, where, after Augustine, many Christian thinkers have come
close to sinking: If God does not order the universe, it would not have
any order at all.  Nature, left to its own, would produce only chaos,
as King Lear discovered.  Insistence on God's control of so much of the
field of human action might seem to whittle away the uses of free will
to a point approaching nullity.  Yet Dante, through Beatrice (see
^Par~. V.19-24), has already insisted on the efficacy of God's greatest
gift to humankind.

	|109-111.~  Charles ends his exposition by an argument from
impossibles.  For God and his informed angels to produce chaos, they
would have to be deficient, and that is impossible.

	|112-114.~  This brief exchange may remind readers of the similar sort
of question-and-answer drill performed by Socrates and one of his
"student" interlocutors (whose response is the deferential "Yes,
Socrates" that still strikes readers as comical) in Platonic dialogues.
 As Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. to verse 114), Dante is here citing
an Aristotelian maxim, "Nature never fails to provide the things that
are necessary," that he also cites in ^Convivio~ IV.xxiv.10,
^Monarchia~ I.x.1, and ^Questio~ 44.

	|115-117.~  Aristotle again sets Charles' agenda; see the opening of
the ^Politics~: "Man is by nature a political animal" (the Latin
Aristotle in fact said that he is a ^civile~ [civic] one, thus
accounting for Dante's ^cive~, which we have translated as "social").

	|118-120.~  To the next proposition (that diversity among humankind is
desirable [see Aristotle, ^Politics~ I.i.2]), Charles himself supplies
Dante's agreement (the poet having in fact already done so in ^Conv~.
IV.iv.5, when he speaks not only of the social needs of human life, but
the need for diversity of occupation among the members of the
community).

	|121.~  The poet now characterizes Charles' method of argumentation as
"deductive," reminding the reader of the Scholastic style of his
conversation.

	|122-126.~  And so, Charles concludes, your natural dispositions to
take up one thing or something else must differ one from another.  It
results that, in order to have leading practitioners of various
necessary human tasks, one of you becomes Solon (a legislator), another
Xerxes (a general), still another Melchizedech (a priest), and finally
Daedalus (an artisan).  These four "orders" of society include the most
necessary activities.

Why Dante chose to identify Daedalus by the tragic flight of his son,
Icarus, is not clear, unless we are to understand the reference as
blending with the next topic (as some commentators do), the differences
between members of the same family.

	|124.~  Paratore ("Il Canto VIII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 257), attempts to
demonstrate that Dante's views of Solon and Xerxes (as well as his
treatment of Romulus in verse 132) derive from ^loci~ in different
books of the ^Historiae adversus paganos~ of Orosius.

	|127-129.~  See Tozer's paraphrase and interpretation of these lines:
"'[T]he nature of the revolving spheres, which, like a seal on wax,
imprints itself on mankind, exercises its art well, but does not
distinguish one house from another.'  In other words: The stellar
influences produce individuality of character in men, but do not favour
one family more than another by perpetuating excellence in it.  Dante
is returning to the question, How can a bad son proceed from a good
father?"

	|127.~  The word ^natura~ is focal to this discussion.  Aversano
(^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent
by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 37) points out that its seven
appearances in this canto represent the heaviest concentration of the
word in the poem.  That is about one-eleventh of its roughly
seventy-seven occurrences. The two other cantos that are particularly
marked by it are ^Inferno~ XI and ^Paradiso~ VII, in both of which it
occurs five times.  Further, these seven presences of ^natura~ fall
within sixty-two lines of one another, at vv. 82, 100, 114, here, 133,
139, 143, thus insisting on its importance in this discussion that is
triggered by consideration of the mean-spirited nature of Charles'
father, Charles II (verse 82), and goes on to widen its focus to
include, as here, ^natura naturans~ ("great creating Nature") and
^natura naturata~ (created Nature [verse 139]).

	|130-132.~  Quirinus was the name given to Romulus, Rome's first king,
posthumously, when he was celebrated as a god.  His mother, Rhea
Silvia, a Vestal Virgin (in some versions of the story), gave birth to
twins and claimed that Mars had lain with her.  Daniello (comm. to this
tercet) may have been the first to refer, in this context, to Virgil
(^Aen~. I. 292-293).  But see Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet), who
"adjusts" the Virgilian passage to the more appropriate verse 274,
where, according to Virgil, Ilia (another name for Rhea Silvia?), a
priestess, bears to Mars her twin offspring, Romulus and Remus.  (It is
striking that neither here nor anywhere in this or in his other works
does Dante mention Remus, Romulus's twin, especially here, given the
facts that he has just considered Jacob and Esau and that their story
has obvious similarities to that of this pair of emulous fraternal
twins, one of whom [Romulus] eventually killed the other.)  And thus
Dante's view (and the standard view in the commentaries) is at some
variance from Virgil's presentation of the immortal bloodlines of the
founder of Rome.  See, for example, Umberto Cosmo (^L'ultima ascesa:
Introduzione alla lettura del "Paradiso"~, ed. B. Maier [Florence: La
Nuova Italia, 1965], p. 78), referring to the fact that: " ...il figlio
di un ignoto plebeo pu@o accogliere in s$e la virt@u di fondare una
citt@a come Roma, e salire tanto alto nella riputazione universale da
esser ritenuto per disceso da un Dio" ( ...the son of an unknown
commoner may harbor the potency exhibited in founding a city like Rome,
in making his way to the pinnacle of general approbation so as to be
considered descended from a god [Mars]).   In the instance of Jacob and
Esau, Dante would seem to be interested only in making the point that
twins may differ from one another, while in that of Romulus and his
unnamed plebeian father the difference involves father and son.  But
the reader, as Dante must have known, will also consider Remus as a
Roman Esau.

	|133-135.~  Charles finishes with a flourish: The lives of fathers
would always map in advance the lives of their offspring (we must
remind ourselves of the sexually skewed biology sponsored by the poet
in ^Purg~. XXV.43-48, which has it that only the paternal seed shapes
the human characteristics of the infant [the rational soul is
inbreathed directly by God]).  Thus, were it not for the mediating
"interference" of Providence rayed down by the stars, we would all be
precisely like our fathers.

	|136.~  As Denise Heilbronn points out ("Contrapuntal Imagery in
^Paradiso~ VIII," ^Italian Culture~ 5 [1984], pp. 45-46), this phrasing
joins with that found in vv. 11-12 and 95-96 to connect with a passage
in ^Convivio~ (II.xiii.14): "and [rhetoric] appears in the morning when
the rhetorician speaks before the face of his hearer, and it appears in
the evening (that is, behind) when the rhetorician speaks through
writing, from a distance."  Whether or not Dante's associations of the
planets with the seven liberal arts in ^Convivio~ is binding in
^Paradiso~ is a question that remains to be settled, but, at the very
least, a certain skepticism seems called for.  It is probably just to
reflect that, had he wanted to insist on these identities, he easily
could have.  That he did not would seem to make their application here
dubious.

	|138.~  For the only other occurrence of the word ^corollario~ in the
poem, see ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.136.  On the word itself, see Vellutello
(comm. to vv. 136-138), responding to the verb form ^ammanti~ (cloak):
"@e ottima comparatione, perch@e s@i come 'l manto @e habito aggiunto
sopra de gli altri habiti, cos@i il corolario ^[sic]~ @e conclusione
aggiunta sopra l'altre conclusioni" (it is a wonderful comparison,
because just as the cloak is a garment worn on top of other garments,
so the corollary is a concluding demonstration added to other
concluding demonstrations).

	|139-141.~  In the guise of sound practical advice, Dante levels his
guns at Robert, as we shall see in the concluding lines of the canto.
Paratore ("Il Canto VIII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~,
ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp. 260-62), gives evidence that
reveals Dante's accord in this view of Nature with that expressed by
St. Thomas in his ^Summa contra Gentiles~ (III.80-81).

Raoul Manselli, "Carlo Martello," ^ED~ I (1970), p. 843a, thinks of
Hugh Capet, of whom Charles Martel turns out to be the only "good
fruit" (^Purg~. XX.45).

It is a curiosity that Daniello (comm. to these verses) is brought to
think of an example of such withering on the vine in the person of
Giovanni Boccaccio, sent by his father to Paris [Naples?] to learn the
ways of the merchant, only to return after his father's death to the
world of letters.

	|142-144.~  If we feel that we are hearing the voice of Rousseau in
these lines, we should remember that ^natura naturata~ is the result of
a process very much under the control of God through his instruments,
the stars.  As we have just learned, God intervenes not only directly,
when He creates our rational souls, but indirectly, in controlling our
innate propensities through the stellar influences.  Thus today it
might seem an expression of a Dantean point of view whenever we hear an
athlete or a singer referring to his or her "God-given talent."

	|145-147.~  A part of John S. Carroll's gloss to vv. 137-148 is worth
having: "There is little doubt that Charles is referring to two of his
own brothers.  Louis, the next to himself in age, almost immediately
after his release from captivity in Aragon, renounced his hereditary
rights, joined the Franciscan Order, and was made Bishop of Toulouse
[Louis died in 1297 and was canonized in 1311].  This renunciation of
the sword, for which Dante evidently thought him better fitted, gave
the throne to his younger brother Robert, who had in him more of the
preacher than the king.  Villani says of him: 'This King Robert was the
wisest king that had been among Christians for five hundred years, both
in natural ability and in knowledge, being a very great master in
theology and a consummate philosopher' [^Chronicle~, xii.10].  Robert
was surnamed 'the Wise.'  Petrarch, who regarded him as the king of
philosophers and poets, submitted to be examined by him for the space
of two days and a half, in the presence of the entire Court, on every
known branch of learning.  Gregorovius sweeps aside Robert's claims to
wisdom with contempt: 'The King enjoyed an undeserved reputation as a
lover of learning, and was himself the author of tedious lucubrations
on religious and profane questions.'  His character reminds us of
James, 'the British Solomon,' who held that 'a sovereign ought to be
the most learned clerk in his dominions,' and took himself seriously as
a great theologian."
