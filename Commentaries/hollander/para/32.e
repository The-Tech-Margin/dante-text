	|1.~  The opening verse of this canto has caused considerable
difficulty.  Without reviewing the various responses (for which see
Scartazzini [comm. to this verse]), we should say that we have followed
fairly freely Scartazzini's basic understanding, which takes "affetto"
as being, here, a Latinism, formed out of the past participle
^(adfectus)~ of the deponent verb ^adficior~ (influence), and thus,
loosely here, "intent upon" or "absorbed by."  As for the noun
^piacer~, we take it here not as "beauty" but as Bernard's "delight" in
Mary.  See also Tozer (comm. to vv. 1-2).  But see Porena (comm. to vv.
1-2) for strong objections to the first of these solutions, arguing
that ^affetto~ means "troubled," an unlikely reading.

Perhaps the most compelling gloss to this opening word of the canto is
found in Aversano's commentary (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the
^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001), p. 165.  He, as did several modern commentators before him
(e.g., Mestica and Mattalia [comms. to this verse]), the latter
acknowledging the lone identical early notice on the part of Francesco
da Buti [comm. to ^Par~. I.1-15], who, however, while pointing to the
deponent verb, doesn't accept that interpretation, preferring the
"affective" solution) traces the source of ^affetto~ to the past
participle of the verb ^afficere~, with the resulting sense of being
affixed, or conjoined.  Aversano attributes this sense of the word to
St. Bernard on two occasions (^PL~ CLXXXIII.1297, CLXXXIII.1384).

	|2-3.~  Porena (comm. to vv. 1-2) suggests that Bernard does not
interrupt his personal adoration of Mary in order to carry out his new
responsibility, as ^doctor~ (teacher), but names the inhabitants of the
Rose from memory (thus indicating the existence of multitasking at the
end of the thirteenth century).  This task, along with allied concerns,
will occupy vv. 4-87 of the canto.

As Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 165, points
out, the adjective ^santo~ (holy) occurs more often in this canto than
in any other (he even undercounts its frequency by one).  In fact, it
occurs here seven times.  There are only three cantos in ^Paradiso~ in
which it does not occur even once: VIII, XXVIII, and (somewhat
surprisingly) XXXIII.

	|4-18.~  For discussion of Dante's choice of the Hebrew women he
included in the Rose, see Giuseppe Di Scipio ("The Hebrew Women in
Dante's Symbolic Rose," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]: 111-21).  See also
the remarks of Carroll (comm. to vv. 8-10).

	|4-6.~  Dante's use of the trope ^hysteron proteron~ is widely noticed.
 It offers an "instant replay" run backward, undoing the universal
effect of the wound of Original Sin, incurred by Eve's eating of the
forbidden fruit, when Mary gave birth to Jesus.  Mary's position in the
Rose, seated with Eve at her feet, reinforces that understanding.

	|8.~  Jacob's first and second wives, Leah and Rachel, as we saw in
^Purgatorio~ XXVII.100-108, represent (as they were traditionally
understood as doing) the active and the contemplative life,
respectively.  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~],
^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 166,
points out that, according to Richard of St. Victor, in his ^Benjamin
major~ (^PL~ CXCVI.62), Rachel, as the first stage of contemplation,
^dilatatio~ (expansion), an identity she shares with Beatrice, yields
to the second stage, represented by the son she died giving birth to,
Benjamin, or ^sublevatio~ (i.e., being raised up), who has a
counterpart in the poem, of course, in Bernard, Dante's Benjamin.  That
state in turn yields to ^alienatio~ (ecstasy), the passing beyond human
limits to experience things as they are in themselves, absolute
reality.  Aversano also cites ^PL~ CXCVI.52 and CXCVI.170.

	|9.~  Beatrice is "out of pattern" with the crossing vertical and
horizontal elements.  This perhaps indicates that such an idiosyncratic
pattern is meant to reflect the individual identity of the beholder.
It thus results that Dante is like everyone else in being uniquely
unlike everyone else, an only apparently paradoxical insight later
developed centrally by Michel de Montaigne.

It does not seem to have caught the attention of any commentator that
Beatrice's name appears in the ninth verse of the canto, that is,
accompanied by her identifying (and trinitarian) number.  Carroll
(comm. to vv. 8-10) comes close.  He, however, dwells on Beatrice's
presence in the ^third~  row, next to Rachel, and then he adverts to
the passage in the ^Vita nuova~ (XXIX.3) that explains the meaning of
Beatrice's "nineness" in terms of nine being the product of the square
of three.  Beatrice is named here for the sixty-second time.  (There
will be one other -- see ^Par~. XXXIII.38; her name thus occurs over a
span of 99 cantos [her first nominal appearance is in ^Inf~. II.70].)
See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XV.77.

Gustavo Costa ("Il canto XXXI del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996]:
70) makes a telling point: Beatrice's presence in the Rose scotches any
attempt to conclude that her status in the poem is merely "allegorical."

	|10.~  Sarah, Rebecca, and Judith were among the Old Testament heroines
harrowed by Christ.  Sarah was the wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac;
Rebecca, the wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob; Judith, the savior of
the Jews from Assyrian captivity when she murdered Holofernes (see
^Purg~. XII.58-60).

	|11-12.~  Ruth is identified only by periphrasis and in her role as the
great-grandmother of David, also indicated by periphrasis.  He is
represented by his sins of adultery and murder (Bathsheba and Uriah),
the setting for Psalm 50 (51), ^Miserere mei~ (Have mercy on me), which
served as the text of Dante's first spoken words as character in the
poem (^Inf~. I.65).  For the meaning of David for Dante, see the notes
to ^Purgatorio~ X.65 and ^Paradiso~ XX.37-39.  And see Carroll's
discussion of a common theme behind at least most of Dante's choices
(comm. to vv. 1-48), which offers another reason for the reference to
David: "[T]hey were all regarded as types of the Church, and they are
for the most part ancestresses of Christ according to the flesh (Rachel
and Judith alone are not in the direct line of our Lord's ancestry.
Judah, through whom the descent flows, was a son of Leah; and Judith
had no children [Judith 16:22]): Ruth, for example, is described as the
^bisava~, the great grandmother, of David, for the purpose, apparently,
of indicating the descent of the Virgin, and therefore of her Son, from
that king.  The manner in which David is referred to -- 'the singer who
for sorrow of his sin said ^Miserere Mei~' (Ps. 51 [50]:1) -- while
apparently irrelevant to the question of descent, is in reality closely
connected with it.  Matthew 1:6 states plainly that 'David the king
begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias.'  The reference
therefore to David's repentance for his great sin, so far from being
irrelevant, suggests in the most delicate way the continuation of the
descent through Solomon."

	|13-15.~  Bernard indicates many more saints than we actually hear him
name; therefore, we probably assume, the poet's selection of the
eighteen who are named is not casually arrived at.  It is Beatrice, who
is "idiosyncratic" (that is, extraneous to the regular and balanced
pattern of the seventeen others who are named), who brings the total to
eighteen, or 2x9; the canto is also composed of two nines: it is the
ninety-ninth canto of the poem.

	|16-21.~  These Hebrew women, the seven whom we have just heard
referred to by name or by periphrasis, are only the beginning of a long
line down the Rose (until we would come to the first Hebrew female
child, we assume) that separates pre-Christian and Christian saints.
As Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 166, points
out, neither Eve (obviously not a descendant of Abraham) nor Ruth (who
was from Moab) can properly be considered Hebrews, despite Dante's
insistence.

Singleton (comm. to vv. 40-42) believes that Dante intends us to
believe that the dividing "walls" of Hebrew women and Christian men
reach all the way to the "floor" of the Rose, and that thus the lower
half of them are surrounded by babies.  That seems a dubious notion,
although Dante does not clearly portray the situation.  If "neatness
counts," he may have expected us to imagine a line of smiling Hebrew
female babies looking across the Rose at equally happy Christian male
babies, while spreading out to either side of those two lines are
babies of the other gender, the first half of them of their own
religion, the second group of the other.  (See the third item in the
note to vv. 37-39.)

	|25-33.~  Dante once again insists on the absence of some saints-to-be
in the Christian half of the Rose (the only place for which he
specifies the eventual tenant is the throne destined for Henry VII [see
the conclusion of ^Par~. XXX]).  He also refers to semicircles in order
to alert us to the fact that there will be a matching descending line,
one composed entirely of males, beneath John the Baptist.  To Mary's
left and John's right sit the Hebrew saints; to her right and to his
left, the Christian ones.  It is not stated, but seems clear, that we
are to picture two ^different~ semicircles, with the midpoint of their
arcs located at Mary and John, containing male saints (beneath Mary)
and female saints (beneath John), except for the bisecting line, which
is gendered as is each of them.  See the chart in the note to verses
37-39.

	|31.~  John's epithet ^gran~ (exalted) reflects, in the opinion of a
great number of commentators, beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to this
verse), Matthew 11:11: "[A]mong those born of women there has arisen no
one greater than John the Baptist."

	|32-33.~  For John's holiness, see Luke 1:15: "and he will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb"; for his martyrdom,
see Matthew 14:3-12, Herod's beheading of John; for his period in Limbo
before he was harrowed, see Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 31-33), being more
precise: "between twenty and twenty-one months."

	|34-36.~  If Dante's treatment of Augustine remains one of the most
puzzling aspects of his poem, he himself is to blame; he seems
deliberately to conceal his debt to Augustine (see the note to ^Par~.
XII.130).  Once Dante studies became more "scientific," in the
nineteenth century, we might have expected that a great "detective" of
Dante's reading habits, Edward Moore, would have started to set things
right in this respect.  However, when he takes up this subject in
^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~ (^Studies in Dante~, First
Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon,
1969 {1896}], pp. 291-94), he is both tentative and hesitant, lest he
overstate the importance of Augustine to Dante.  Here are his
concluding words (p. 294): "I must confess, in conclusion, that I have
not been able as yet to investigate the question of Dante's probable
acquaintance with the works of St. Augustine nearly as fully as the
subject seems to deserve.  I am continually coming on fresh points of
resemblance.  There is, however, always this element of uncertainty,
that many of his theories or arguments are reproduced by Aquinas,..."
One does not want to blame Moore for the general under-appreciation of
Augustine's importance for Dante.  Nonetheless, the great scholar's
hesitance undoubtedly affected others, who felt excused thereby from
studying the problem as carefully as it "seems to deserve."  For better
appreciations, if not the central study that is still badly needed, see
Francesco Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia":
"Inferno" -- Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967], ^passim~; F.X.
Newman ("St. Augustine's Three Visions and the Structure of the
^Commedia~," ^Modern Language Notes~ 82 [1967]: 56-78); Giovanni
Fallani ("Dante e S. Agostino," in his ^L'esperienza teologica di
Dante~ [Lecce: Milella, 1976], pp. 185-203); John Freccero (^Dante: The
Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1986], esp. pp. 1-15); Giuseppe Mazzotta (^Dante,
Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979], esp.
pp. 147-91; Albert Wingell ("The Forested Mountaintop in Augustine and
Dante," ^Dante Studies~ 99 [1981]: 9-48); John Took ("'Diligite
iustitiam qui iudicatis terram': Justice and the Just Ruler in Dante,"
in ^Dante and Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse [Oxford: Clarendon,
1997], pp. 137-51); Peter Hawkins ("Divide and Conquer: Augustine in
the ^Divine Comedy~," ^PMLA~ 106 [1991]: 471-82).  Like Hawkins, Selene
Sarteschi ("Sant'Agostino in Dante e nell'et@a di Dante," in her ^Per
la "Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 {1999}],
pp. 171-94) believes that there is a widespread and often
unacknowledged interaction between the texts of Augustine and those of
Dante.  Her method may at times seem suspect, in that she on occasion
finds familiar Christian topoi in St. Augustine and then argues for
their direct influence on Dante, when any number of sources and
intermediaries may have shaped the poet's texts.  This is not to
disagree with the basic purpose of her study, which is to put Augustine
more into play as a source than he is sometimes allowed to be.
However, it should also be said that, with the exceptions of Mazzoni
and Freccero, she has not referred to the work of any of the scholars
cited above.

See the note to ^Paradiso~ XII.130  for discussion of the appearance of
Augustine's name (but not the saint) in ^Paradiso~ X and XII.  And see
Lauren Scancarelli Seem ("^Nolite iudicare~: Dante and the Dilemma of
Judgment," in ^Writers Reading Writers: Intertextual Studies in
Medieval and Early Modern Literature in Honor of Robert Hollander~, ed.
Janet Levarie Smarr [Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2007] p.
82), pointing out that these two nominal presences arouse our
expectations, but when Augustine finally does appear (at ^Par~.
XXXII.35), he is only a word from hitting the cutting-room floor, as it
were, to be included, unbeknownst to us, among the unnamed others (^e
altri~) seated in the Rose.  This close call (and Dante's playful
tussle with the reader over Augustine's fate in the Dantean afterworld)
may possibly be explained by the fact of Augustine's strenuous
opposition to the imperial (and republican) Roman ideal.  Thus the
Augustinian tale of two cities, which extols the City of God and its
embattled earthly precursor, the Church Militant, but has no room for
the empire in its world view, is the work of an enemy.  There is no
question but that Dante knew Augustine's work and admired it deeply -
as theology, but even as theology only up to a point.  And the issue
that divides these two thinkers is Rome.

Augustine knew that imperial Virgil had to be resisted publicly and
spiritedly, and yet he makes his ^Confessions~ a sort of epic
Mediterranean counter-voyage (see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ {Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}], p. 12 and
n.), in which the pivotal municipal moment occurs not in an imperial
monument in Rome but in a church in Milan.  And if the text is
seemingly a-Virgilian, even anti-Virgilian, it is nonetheless studded
with Virgilian references.  If that sounds suggestive of Dante's later
treatment of Virgil in his Christian epic, the differences are perhaps
not so very great (e.g., the gaudy textual transformations of Monica,
whom Augustine steals away from (in Book V.8) just as Aeneas abandons
Dido (in Book IV of the ^Aeneid~), but then who is described (in Book
IX.9), as though in apology, in a Virgilian phrase (^Aen~. VII.57:
"plenis annis nubilis") used of Lavinia.  When the late Arthur Hanson
and Robert Hollander jointly taught a seminar on "Virgil in the Middle
Ages" in the spring of 1973 at Princeton, Hanson, who entered the
seminar an anti-Augustinian pagan-embracing classicist, ended up
admiring Augustine, not least because, as one who knew Virgil really
well, he recognized a kindred spirit.  To be sure, Augustine refers to
Virgil with increasing hostility, until, in ^De civitate Dei~, the
Roman poet is made the whipping boy for all that brought the imperial
city low.  At the same time, Hanson found that the ^Confessions~ (a
work with a public stance that is clearly critical of Virgilian values)
exhibits a ^cento~-like tesselation of pieces of the Roman poet that
serve no polemical anti-pagan purpose but are there, apparently, simply
because Augustine just will not be without them.  (The Virgilian aspect
of Augustine mainly escapes the attention of James O'Donnell in his
fine new biographical study [^Augustine: A New Biography~ {New York:
HarperCollins, 2005}].)

Dante's view of Augustine, as is his view of other major sources, is
various.  For him, Augustine has most of the important equations -- the
theological ones -- right; he is desperately wrong about a single major
issue: the relation of Roman ^imperium~ to God's plan for the world.
Aquinas is better on that subject, but gets a failing grade for his
hostility to poetry as a way to truth.  Virgil got most things right
except for the most important one: God.  Francis understood the role of
love in God's world perhaps better than anyone else, but failed to
grasp the importance of reason (Thomas's bailiwick).  Among the
ancients, Aristotle understood the framework of the created universe
perhaps better than anyone (at least before Thomas), but couldn't marry
the concept of spirit to his otherwise flawless understanding.  Plato
and later platonizing thinkers, on the other hand, were admirable in
that respect, but they failed utterly to comprehend the importance of
this world and its progress through time.  It is perhaps fair to say
that Dante was possibly the first great synthesizer of the modern era
(the Renaissance is generally seen as the period in which modern
syncretism was born [the word apparently has its first post-classical
appearance in the ^Adagia~ of Erasmus], what with such thinkers as Pico
della Mirandola seeking to develop a system that reflected many
others).  If this is true, why have we not appreciated it before?
(See, however, ^Par~. X.99 for Baranski's use of the term.)  Dante is
frequently understood and often presented as the most "orthodox" of
thinkers, ^the~ exponent of the medieval and theologized Christian
sense of life.  Such a view is not incorrect; that was precisely what
Dante hoped he had accomplished.  However, the formulation does not
take into account the violence that he does to every system of thought
that he incorporates in his own.  As a result, any attempt to square
Dante with a single school of thought (e.g., Busnelli's Thomist Dante)
is eventually doomed to failure.

The word ^sincretismo~ is a late arrival to the commentary tradition
(at least as it is represented by the holdings of the DDP).  It is
first found in Sapegno's commentary, where it occurs four times (at
^Inf~. XIV.86, ^Inf~. XXIV.25, ^Purg~. XXX.21, ^Purg~. XXXIII.49-51),
always in the limited sense found in his phrase "consueto sincretismo
di elementi classici e medievali" (usual syncretism of classical and
medieval elements [cited from the last occurrence]).  In other words,
Sapegno is speaking of a "limited sincretism," indicating only Dante's
Christianizing treatment of pagan sources.  As the term is more
properly used, it has the following main characteristic, according to
the entry in ^Wikipedia~ (online): "Religious syncretism exhibits the
blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or
the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated
traditions."  Historically, the word has a brief but distinguished
history, which is attested in many sources: "The Greek word occurs in
Plutarch's (1st century AD) essay on 'Fraternal Love' in his ^Moralia~
(2.490b).  He cites the example of the Cretans who reconciled their
differences and came together in alliance when faced with external
dangers.  'And that is their so-called Syncretism.' . . .  Erasmus
probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word (in his ^Adagia~,
published in the winter of 1517-1518) to designate the coherence of
dissenters in spite of their differences in theological opinions.  In a
letter to Melancthon of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced
the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage 'Concord is a mighty
rampart')."

Mattalia (com. to ^Inf~. IV.130) refers to the syncretic nature of
Scholasticism itself, weaving a unitary view out of many strands of
diverse authorities.  That passage is perhaps the only one found in the
commentary tradition to modify the sense found in Sapegno of a more
limited pagan-Christian "syncretism."  And Sapegno's is the sense
active in the three uses of the word in Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Inf~.
XIV.68-70, to ^Purg~. XXX.21, and to ^Par~. II.8-9) -- their first use
of the word may reflect Sapegno's usage in the same passage in
^Inferno~.

	|35.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse): Dominic is not here only
because his Order used the Augustinian Rule and the three others
mentioned here, Augustine, Benedict, and Francis (to name them in
chronological order), each composed the Rule for his Order.  See the
note to ^Par~. XII.46-57.  Others have tried to wrestle with the
apparently slighting omission of reference to Dominic here, made all
the more troublesome by the fact that in ^Convivio~ (IV.xxviii.9),
Dante refers to Benedict, Augustine, Francis, and Dominic (in that
order).  There they are exemplars of the religious life.  Among the
early commentators, only Francesco da Buti apparently felt that the
omission required comment.  He revisits Thomas's insistence (^Par~.
XI.40-42) that what is said in praise of one (Francis) is to be
understood equally of the other (Dominic).  The commentator's memory
(or the pen of his scribe) is flawed; he places the remark in the
following (twelfth) canto.  The few others who tackle the problem do
not suggest more convincing hypotheses than that offered by
Bosco/Reggio.

The reverse chronological order of the presentation of the three names
is also a bit puzzling; since Augustine is in rhyme position, that
might explain the order; however, he is the ^first~ rhyme, and one
usually assumes that this is chosen more freely.

	|36.~  From Bernard's remark at vv. 14-15, where he says that he will
name many other saints in the line descending from Mary, we surely
assume that this line beneath the Baptist, probably composed of other
religious leaders, was also identified, but not reported.  See the note
to vv. 13-15.

	|37-39.~  John Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-48) was perhaps the first to
claim that the arrangement of the named souls might have an
iconographical effect: "It is not likely to be accidental that the Rose
is thus blessed with the sign of the Cross on each side."  The design
formed in the Rose by those who are named is possibly reminiscent of
the T or ^tau~, the emblem of the cross so important in the iconography
of St. Francis, as John Fleming, among others, has demonstrated (^From
Bonaventure to Bellini: An Essay in Franciscan Exegesis~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1982], pp. 99-128).  Francis knew that
Ezechiel (9:4) had said that the faithful would all be marked with the
^tau~ on their foreheads and took it as his particular version of the
sign of the cross.

When we consider the saints in the order they are named (the numeration
is provided in the diagram below), our sense of that is reinforced,
since the poet first fills up the I-stem of the figure (plus the
idiosyncratic adjunct of Beatrice, for which see the note to verse 9),
then arranges the bar of the T in a chiasmus (15-14-13-16), and then
finally adds its foot, chronologically ordered (Anne, then Lucy).

Fausto Montanari ("Il canto XXXII del ^Paradiso~," ^Nuove letture
dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], p. 256) points out
the symmetries in the arrangement of this seating plan of Heaven; the
stadium is divided into corresponding zones by the following six
groups, further sorted into three pairs: Old Testament, New Testament;
Men, Women (both of these groups on horizontal axes); Adults, Infants
(on a vertical axis).

Since our subject is Dante, it will come as no surprise to the reader
to learn that even this diagram (above) is controversial.  While there
is consensus among some, perhaps expressed in the clearest and briefest
terms by Vincenzo Pernicone ("Il canto XXXII del ^Paradiso~," in his
^Studi danteschi e altri saggi~, ed. M.D. Wanke [Genoa: Universit@a
degli Studi, 1984 {1965}], p. 109), there is a surprising amount of
disagreement over what seems close to self-evident.  Among the issues
found variously among the discussants are the following: (1) Do the
indications "left" and "right" (vv. 121-124) indicate directions from
the protagonist's perspective or from (respectively) the Virgin's and
John's?  (2) Does Dante consider Lucy and Anne as figures who should be
present in the "Christian" or "Jewish" section of the Rose, and has he
botched his placement of them as a result?  (3) How many rows are there
in this celestial stadium?

(1) There are intensely held views on either side of this issue.  For a
discussion of these, see Antonio Russi ("Canto XXXII," in ^Lectura
Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier,
1968], pp. 1176-87), who devotes a major portion of his ^lectura~ to a
labored attempt at resolving the directional indications in the canto.
Picone ("Canto XXXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
494) is matter-of-fact in declaring that we are seeing them from the
perspective of ^Dante's~ left and right.  Such a view would require
that the reader imagine the post-Advent saints as seated to Mary's
left, and those pre-Advent to her right.  It is true that the poet does
not make their disposition clear, leaving us to deal with the question.
 On the other hand, placing the New Testament figures to Mary's left
would seem an implausible choice.  God would not be so rude a host to
these heroes of Christianity in forming His Eternal Seating Plan.

(2) The question of the arrangement of the two souls on either side of
John the Baptist (see vv. 133-138) has also been strangely
controversial.  Several commentators contrive to put Lucy to John's
right, believing her a pre-Christian figure.  Russi ("Canto XXXII," in
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1968], p. 1187), accepting this arrangement, goes on to argue
that she is not the historical Lucy, but a symbol of illuminating
grace.  (It is surprising how long it was until a commentator treated
Lucy as historical, the third-century martyr from Syracuse; the first
appears to have been Portirelli [comm. to vv. 136-141] in the early
nineteenth century.  Did his precursors really believe that Dante had
granted an allegory a seat in Heaven, in which it would eventually wear
its own flesh?)  The situation barely improves in more recent times,
when, even after Lucy of Syracuse has entered the commentary tradition,
some moderns revert to the age-old error.

(3) Picone ("Canto XXXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~,
ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002],
p. 495), discussing verses 16-18, which enumerate the seven levels of
the stadium down from Mary through Ruth, goes on to extrapolate from
that passage an erroneous supposition, namely, that there are only that
many rows in the upper half of the Rose.  From that assumption he (only
logically) calculates that the lower half (the kindergarten, as it
were) must be comprised of the same number of rows (seven).  However,
what we know does not accord easily with his hypothesis.  See, for the
vast upward expanse of the Rose, ^Paradiso~ XXX.115-118 and XXXI.73-75
(where we learn that Beatrice, not even in the highest rank of the
Rose, is at a distance even greater than that between the lowest point
on earth and the farthest reach of its atmosphere).  If we were to
accept Picone's calculations, we would have to understand that a mere
twelve rows of the Rose rose upward in that vast a space.  (Not to be
preferred are other attempts at numerical precision, even if they seem
properly more grandiose.  See, for instance, Russi [p. 1169], citing G.
Barone as having calculated, in 1906, the rows as numbering 1,290.)
Indeed, the text itself makes it quite clear that there are more Hebrew
women beneath Ruth, forming the dividing line.  (What it doesn't tell
us is whether the line stops at the halfway mark [see the note to vv.
40-48] to be continued by female Hebrew babies, or whether, as at least
Singleton believes, it goes all the way to the Rose's "floor" [see the
note to vv. 16-21]).  Further, if Dante accepted, at least as an
approximate guide, the canonical 144,000 who make up the citizenry of
the Empyrean (see the notes to ^Par~. XXX.103-108 and ^Par~.
XXXI.115-117), Picone's fourteen rows would each need to seat more than
ten thousand souls.  To be fair, he was led to this view by his
arguably possible interpretation of the word ^soglie~ (either "seats"
or "tiers"; he chooses the former).  That, however, is to neglect the
clear significance of the word ^soglia~ at ^Paradiso~ XVIII.28, which
clearly illuminates the next use of the word at verse 13 of this canto;
in both these uses Dante is fairly obviously referring to "rows" and
not individual "seats."  Perhaps the rhyme position helps explain the
use he made of an expanded meaning of the word.

Other, if less noticed, problems about the population of the Rose are
caused by the location of Beatrice's presence in it.  This is obviously
idiosyncratic to this particular viewer, since it is the only element
not part of a balanced design.  And, compounding that problem, her
placement itself seems to be problematic, out of order.  From what we
are nearly forced to extrapolate from the arrangement seen in the top
row, the center lines divide male from female on both sides of the
Rose.  Thus Beatrice should be next to a male (e.g., Benedict).
Iconography apparently trumped the boy-girl ordering principle in
Dante's mind.  Further, he had boxed himself into this arrangement in
^Inferno~ II.102, where Beatrice says that Lucy came to her in Heaven
where she was seated next to Rachel.  In any case, there does not seem
to be a way around the fact that in placing Beatrice next to Rachel,
Dante has violated his own unstated but clearly formulated rules.  The
following arrangement is based on the left-right axis as provided for

	|38-39.~  All those commentators who believe that Dante "doesn't mean"
what he indicates, that, in Heaven for the Last Judgment and general
resurrection, there will be an equal number of Christians and Hebrews
(the latter including only a few gentiles in their number, at least two
[see the note to ^Par~. XXXI.25-27] and only possibly more), should
have to recite these lines aloud before saying anything about the issue.

	|40-48.~  Dante now draws another boundary line, this one dividing the
"north-south" axis of the Rose into two portions of equal height
(though of unequal volume).  There are three classes of saved babies,
all of whom, because they had not attained the age of reason, died only
in their inherited sinfulness (i.e., without positive sin): (1) Jewish
infants who somehow shared their parents' faith in Christ to come; (2)
Jewish infants whose parents, once circumcision was instituted as a
ritual by the Jews, had them circumcised (see the note to vv. 76-81);
(3) Christian infants who had the better form of "circumcision,"
baptism.  In real terms, then, the rules for Christian infants were
more stringent.

	|43.~  The "conditions" referred to indicate, of course, ritual
circumcision.

	|46-48.~  Dante obviously enjoyed rewarding himself for his strict
interpretation of the law of baptism in ^Inferno~ IV.30, when he agreed
with St. Thomas that all unbaptized children will be found in Limbo.
Now he sees a multitude of saved infants, and he dwells much longer on
them.

See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXXI.59 for discussion of the presence of
these babes, not as the adults they should become (according to the
standard view), but as the babies they were, back in their sweet flesh.
 See Nardi (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e
Letteratura"],
1944), pp. 317-34, for the "age" of the babes in Heaven and other
problems associated with their presence here.

	|49-84.~  Dante now chooses to deal, at some length, with a knotty
problem: Do these sinless and saved innocents appear in the Rose in any
meaningful pattern, as do the adults?  This matter is set forth and
resolved in three parts (vv. 49-60, 61-66, and 67-84).

	|49-60.~  ^Part I~: Bernard has divined that Dante, observing that
these infants seem to be ranked in some sort of preferential order,
immediately counters that (true) perception with the perfectly sensible
notion that they only ^seem~ to be ordered by their varying merit, but
are in fact merely casually arranged (for how can one distinguish one
infant's moral perfection from another's?).  In response, he treats his
pupil as though he were a balky schoolboy (the reader may
understandably feel surprise; we are, after all, very near the final
vision).

	|49.~  The Latin verb ^silere~ (to be silent) is the source of Dante's
Latinism.

	|57.~  The metaphor refers to the hypothesis that lies behind Dante's
question.  No, Bernard says, there is no possibility, in this realm, of
what exists existing without a reason.  Thus, if you see gradation,
there ^is~ gradation, and there is a reason for it.

	|61-66.~  ^Part II~: The second stage of Bernard's response to Dante's
unvoiced question is a clear answer: Nothing happens casually here.
The reason for His ordering the infants' places as He does is in the
mind of God and it is futile to try to fathom His reasons; just accept
them.  (And it may be particularly difficult to accept the idea that
God creates human souls with unequal degrees of ability to know Him.)

	|67-84.~  ^Part III~: The third and final stage of his response is to
give examples of God's other and similar behavior, which might have
made it clear even to Dante that His preference for preference has
always been manifest in the varying degrees of his grace.

	|67-75.~  Dante might have learned, for instance, from the Bible that
God loves variously.  See Malachi 1:2-3: "Yet I have loved Jacob but
Esau I have hated."  And this while they were still in the womb.
Distinguishing them was not what they have done (they have not ^done~
anything), but as though the color of their hair (Esau; see Genesis
25:25).  That is the uncomprehending human view.  God sees what we do
not, and knows what we do not: the inner sight of our fellow beings.
Esau's red and Jacob's black here were only the outward manifestations
of their inner differences, their abilities to know and love God.

	|76-84.~  Making clear what was latent in lines 40-48, Bernard now
details the "history of grace" for babies, at first their parents' love
for Christ to come, then circumcision, and finally (in the age of
Christ) baptism.

For the first two of these, see St. Thomas (^ST~ III, q. 70, a. 4),
cited by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 76-78): "Ante institutionem
circumcisionis fides Christi futuri iustificabat tam pueros quam
adultos" (Before the institution of circumcision, faith in Christ to
come justified both little children and adults).  Bosco/Reggio go on to
point out that Thomas (^ST~ III, q. 70, a. 2) also holds that Original
Sin is passed along through males alone (though it affects all, since
our race cannot rely on matrilineal parthenogenesis), which accounts
for the emphasis on male circumcision in the second tercet of this
passage.  However, the rules became more stringent once Christ came,
with baptism now mandatory for the salvation of the innocent.

	|79.~  Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 79-81) understands that the "age
of circumcision" began with Abraham.  The author of the Codice
Cassinese (comm. to this verse) was the first to understand the
reference here as being to the first two ages, from Adam to the Flood,
from the Flood to Abraham, some 3184 years according to him.

	|80.~  Allen Mandelbaum translates Dante's phrase "innocenti penne" as
"his innocent member."  This unwarranted interpretation ("penis" is not
etymologically related to "penna") may have seemed plausible because of
the reference to circumcision in verse 81.  Daniello (comm. to vv.
79-81) is the first (and only) commentator to attempt this "exceedingly
bizarre" interpretation (Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 80-81]).
Scartazzini goes on to paraphrase the passage as follows: "In order to
fly up to Heaven, it was necessary for male children to gain strength
for their innocent wings through the ritual of circumcision."
Freudians will draw their obvious conclusions, but it is probably
better to leave that implication to the reader.

	|83-87.~  Bernard's lecture ends with the fourth and concluding set of
identical rhymes on ^Cristo~.  See the notes to ^Paradiso~ XII.71-75
and XIV.103-108.

	|85-87.~  This transitional tercet presents the face of Mary as
preparation for the final vision of Christ's features in the next canto
(verse 131), a stunning detail, suggesting a resemblance both physical
for the human side of the Godhead and spiritual (Mary's perfect purity
of soul as the only human worthy of bearing the Christ).

	|88-93.~  And now, as a sort of coda to the foregoing "lecture," the
angels radiate their pleasure in her down from above to Mary.  Gabriel,
who had before (see ^Par~. XXIII.94-96) descended to reenact the
Annunciation, does so once again, spreading his wings as the painters
of this scene always show him doing, and singing her song.

	|95.~  Gabriel's praise of Mary is the last singing we hear in the
poem.  (For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to
^Par~. XXI.58-60.)  If we recall the first parodic references to
"hymns" (^Inf~. VII.125) or "songs" (^Inf~. XIX.118) or "psalms"
(^Inf~. XXXI.69) to describe anti-melodic utterance in Hell, we realize
the care with which Dante organized his plan for the "musical score" of
the ^Commedia~, beginning ^in bono~ with the first singing heard in
^Purgatorio~ (II.46-48), the "theme song" of the entire work,
Psalm 113, ^In Isr,ael de Aegypto~.

	|97-99.~  The assembled choirs of Heaven, angelic and human, share a
moment of joy in Mary, both singing and beaming with love.

	|97.~  The word ^cantilena~, a hapax, would seem to refer specifically
to Gabriel's song (although some think it is more general in its
reference).  The singers would seem to include (although there is some
uncertainty about this also) everyone on the scene, all the angels and
all the saints, and their response, according to Benvenuto (comm. to
vv. 94-99), is both spoken and sung: "cantantes et dicentes Dominus
tecum etc." (singing and saying "The Lord be with you," etc.).
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 85-99) fills in the "etc." by reciting
the full response: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the
fruit of your womb, Jesus."

^Cantilena~ (at least in Italian) seems to be a coinage of Dante's.  It
happens that the word is also a hapax in the Vulgate (as Aversano has
noted [^Dante daccapo~ {glosses to the ^Paradiso~}, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001], p. 169),
occurring in the following passage of Ecclesiasticus (47:13-18):
"Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God gave him rest on every side,
that he might build a house for his name and prepare a sanctuary to
stand for ever. / How wise you became in your youth! You overflowed
like a river with understanding. / Your soul covered the earth, and you
filled it with parables and riddles. / Your name reached to far-off
islands, and you were loved for your peace. / For your songs
^[cantilenis]~ and proverbs and parables, and for your interpretations,
the countries marveled at you. / In the name of the Lord God, who is
called the God of Israel, you gathered gold like tin and amassed silver
like lead."  Aversano reasonably enough believes that the word
^cantilenae~ here reflects the songs of Solomon gathered in the
^Cantica canticorum~.  Thus ^cantilena~ may have a certain affinity
with the last coinage for a God-derived song, ^t,eodia~, that we heard
in ^Paradiso~ XXV.73, as Mattalia (comm. to verse 97) suggests.

	|100-102.~  Dante's last address to Bernard sounds like a conflation of
his farewells to Beatrice (^Par~. XXXI.79-81) and to Virgil (^Purg~.
XXX.46-51), his first "padre" in the poem.  (See the note to ^Par~.
XVI.16.)

	|100.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 169,
observes that only St. Peter is also apostrophized with this exact
phrase ("O santo padre" [^Par~. XXIV.124]).  He goes on to suggest that
we are thus meant to infer that Bernard is, like Peter, seated in the
topmost tier of the Rose.  However, some of Dante's hesitations about
Peter's hesitations (see the note to ^Par~. XXIV.124-126) may have
eventually served to keep the poet mum about Peter's position in the
Rose.

	|103-105.~  The protagonist does all of us who need assistance a favor
by asking Bernard who that angelic presence was.

	|107-108.~  Mary is now presented as the morning star, Venus, a moment
that certainly Nietzsche would have to agree is a pronounced
"transvaluation of value," even if he might not approve of the result.

	|109-114.~  Bernard identifies Gabriel as the angel who carried
the palm of victory down to Mary at the Annunciation when Jesus decided
to give His life for our salvation.  Whose victory? Hers, for having
been chosen; eventually ours, over death.

	|112-114.~  Is it possible that Dante is conflating two "annunciations"
in this little scene?  Professor Hugh Dawson suggested as much in an
e-mail communication (January 2006).  According to him the palm of
victory is more suited to the second scene of a visitation of Gabriel
to the Virgin (he refers to such medieval accounts as that found in the
^Legenda aurea~ of Jacopo da Varagine), when, as the time of her death
approaches, he presents her with a palm-leaf as the sign of her coming
victory over death, represented by her arriving in the Empyrean in the
body.  Dawson points out that the palm in the first visitation is more
a sign of her "exceptionalism" (Dawson's word) than of her "victory"
(to which one might respond that by giving birth to the Christ she is
assuring humankind its victory over sin and death; further that Dante
himself specifically links the palm to the first Annunciation).
Nonetheless, his point is worthy of consideration.  And it is not
inconceivable that Dante hoped his readers would consider ^both~
visitations of Gabriel to Mary in response to this tercet.  In support
of his thesis, Dawson reports that in Duccio di Buoninsegna's "Maest@a"
of 1308 both Annunciations are represented.  "The first is imagined in
the predella panel now in the London National Gallery; there Gabriel
carries a staff as his emblem of office.  The Annunciation of the
Virgin's Death is shown in the front pinnacle of the surviving
'Maest@a' in Siena, and in that scene Gabriel carries a palm."

For potential confirmation of Dawson's hypothesis, see Carroll (comm.
to vv. 109-114): "Vernon is mistaken in saying that in most of the
representations of the Annunciation Gabriel bears a palm.  Sometimes he
has a lily, a sceptre, a cross, an olive-branch, and sometimes nothing
at all.  It is difficult to translate ^leggiadria~ in line 109, but the
dainty grace of Fra Angelico's Angel of the Annunciation seems to me to
convey the idea."  However, as the text itself would seem to suggest,
Dante himself seems to foreclose on this option, putting a palm leaf in
Gabriel's hand when he first descended to Mary.

	|115.~  The three words at the beginning of this verse echo Virgil's
similar urgings of Dante to come along in ^Inferno~ XX.124 and
^Purgatorio~ IV.137.

	|116-117.~  The language is that of imperial Rome ("patricians,"
"empire") "transvaluated" into Christian terms, or at least terms that
are positive in either context: justice and piety, perhaps the values
most readily translatable between, in many respects, two very different
cultures.

	|118-120.~  The two "roots" of the Rose are Adam, "father" of all those
who believed in Christ to come, and St. Peter, the first leader of His
Church.

For a study in which the Rose is seen as the culmination of the
vegetation motif in the poem, see Margherita Frankel ("Biblical
Figurations in Dante's Reading of the ^Aeneid~," ^Dante Studies~ 100
[1982]: 13-23).  Her article studies this motif, from the tree losing
its leaves in the simile of ^Inferno~ III.112-116 through its
culmination in the form of a repetaled rose, moving from Virgilian
tragedy to Dantean comedy.  See also Stefano Prandi (^Il "Diletto
legno":  Aridit@a e fioritura mistica nella "Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1994] for a similar appreciation, if from a different
perspective.

	|119.~  Calling the Queen of Heaven "Agosta" is a daring
"imperializing" touch.  The last time we heard the adjective it was in
Beatrice's mouth (^Par~. XXX.136) and described a true emperor, Henry
VII.  This is perhaps as far as Dante can go in the vein initiated in
^Purgatorio~ XXXII.102, "that Rome where Christ Himself is Roman."

	|121-126.~  Adam and St. Peter each receive a ^terzina~, the former the
author of our woe, the latter the agent of our redemption as the
founder of the Mystical Body of Christ, the Church, which holds the
keys to the Kingdom.

	|121.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 121-126) says that this verb,
^aggiustarsi~, translates the Latin ^appropinquare~ (to near,
approach).  It is yet another hapax occurring in rhyme position.

	|127-129.~  St. John the Evangelist, who, as author/scribe of the
Apocalypse, saw the final tribulations of the Church in his visions on
the Isle of Patmos.  See Dante's "portrait" of him (^Purg~. XXIX.144),
^dormendo, con la faccia arguta~ (as though he slept, despite his keen
expression).  Is this a prefiguration of Dante's visionary experience
that is being prepared for in these concluding verses of this canto?
See the note to verse 139.

	|130-132.~  Three spaces past Peter and next to Adam sits Moses, who
led the stiff-necked Israelites (first in Exodus 32:9) through the
desert, feeding them on manna (Exodus 16:14-15).

	|133-135.~  Diametrically opposite St. Peter sits Anne, the mother of
Mary.  She is apparently the only occupant of the Rose allowed the
special privilege of ^not~ looking up at God, but across the rim of the
stadium at her daughter.

	|136-138.~  The "greatest father" is, of course, Adam.
This is Saint Lucy's third appearance in the poem (see
^Inf~. II.97 and ^Purg~. IX.52-63).  Bernard here reminds Dante of the
first one, when he was "ruining" downward back toward death (^Inf~.
I.61) when Virgil appeared to him, the result of the collaboration of
the Virgin, Lucy, and Beatrice (seated at first where she is right now,
next to Rachel [^Inf~. II.102]).

	|139.~  This verse has caused innumerable problems.  Giacalone (comm.
to vv. 139-144) compiles six differing attempts at interpretation;
there are probably more, but one must admit it is hard to distinguish
shadings of meaning from substantial differences.  Most can agree that
the verse refers to time and to sleep, but what exactly is time doing
to the protagonist and what sort of sleep is involved?  Further, and
pivotal, is a distinction about when the dreaming referred to occurred
or is occurring or will occur.  The basic disagreements have, it is
probably fair to say, their roots in the temporal relation of Dante's
dreaming.  (1) Either Dante has been "dreaming" from the beginning of
this special experience, as might be indicated by ^Inferno~ I.11, where
Dante admits he was full of sleep when he lost the true way, and/or (2)
is "dreaming" now (in the sense that he is having a more than normal
experience of the afterworld), or (3) will be "out of time" (in both
senses of the phrase) when he has the final vision of the Trinity, for
which Bernard will seek Mary's aid, in a few minutes.  Teodolinda
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1992], pp. 144-51) carries on a long
conversation with Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1934]), in which she unsuccessfully tries to undermine his
sense of the issue, which stands waiting, blocking the path to her
eventual position.  Barolini wants to make the entire poem "visionary."
 Barbi, on the other hand, wants to distinguish between the
"experiential" feel of most of the narrated journey and "vision"
properly speaking.  And the fact that there are "real" dreams presented
in the poem (e.g., in ^Purg~. IX, XIX, and XXVII) certainly implies
that the rest of the time Dante is having "normal" experience of the
decidedly post-normal things he witnesses in the afterworld.

The crux of the issue found in this verse is to what precise (or for
that matter general) dreaming the text refers.  More than one hundred
years ago, Torraca (comm. to vv. 139-141) read the verse as follows:
"[P]erch@e gi@a cessa il tuo essere nel tempo, finisco, per non
ritardare la tua partecipazione all'eternit@a, la tua visione suprema"
(Because your presence in time already is ceasing, I finish speaking,
so as not to delay your participation in eternity, your supreme
vision).  For a recent paper, not very distant from Torraca's finding,
see Tony Cuzzilla ("^Par~. 32.139: 'Ma perche' 'l tempo fugge che t'assonna',"
^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [March
2003]), whose views influenced our reading of the verse.  What he
suggests is that the "sleep" is the mystic vision, already referred to
in the picture of John "dreaming" in ^Purgatorio~ XXIX (see the note to
vv. 127-129).

For some other discussions, see G.L. Passerini (^La "Divina Commedia"
di Dante Alighieri commentata da G.L. Passerini~ [Florence: Sansoni,
1918], ^ad loc~.); Etienne Gilson ("La conclusion de la ^Divine
Com$edie~ et la mystique franciscaine," ^R$evue d'histoire
franciscaine~ 1 [1924], pp. 62-63); Vincenzo Pernicone ("Il canto XXXII
del ^Paradiso~," in his ^Studi danteschi e altri saggi~, ed. M.D. Wanke
[Genoa: Universit@a degli Studi, 1984 {1965}], pp. 120-21).  Gilson
cites Canticle of Canticles 5:2, "Ego dormio et cor meum vigilat" (I
sleep and my heart wakes), a passage that Bonaventure uses to indicate
the state of ecstatic vision.  And see Patrick Boyde (^Perception and
passion in Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1993], pp. 130-39) for a discussion of ^somnia~ (dreams).  See also the
note to ^Paradiso~ XXVII.79-81.

The fact that there are dreams within the poem would seem effectively
to close off the avenue that Barolini would like to keep open as a
possible reading, that the poem is a vast dream vision.  In this
writer's view, Dante signals in ^Inferno~ I and ^Paradiso~ XXXII that
he knows he ^should~ be writing such a work, but has dared to go beyond
the usual allowable poetic convention.  Perhaps nothing brings this
point home quite as well as a reading of Boccaccio's ^Amorosa visione~,
so carefully modelled upon the ^Commedia~ and so very different from
it; it is a ^pastiche~ of a dream vision; Dante's poem is its opposite,
a historical narrative which culminates in a "real vision."

	|140-141.~  Gian Carlo Alessio ("Un appunto su ^Paradiso~
XXXII.139-141," ^Nozze Cociglio-Magnino~ [Verona: Valdonega, 1989], p.
12) finds a source for Dante's much-admired image in the conclusion of
a treatise on epistolary rhetoric, ^Palma~, by Buoncompagno da Signa.
Advising his reader that he should measure out his epistolary space
with care, so that his thoughts will all fit onto the amount of paper
reserved for them, Buoncompagno continues his thought with a simile:
"sicut providus sartor pannum, de quo camisiam disposuit facere vel
gunnellam" (just as a tailor, having thought ahead, has prepared the
cloth from which to make a shirt or else a skirt).

	|142-144.~  Bernard calls our attention to the fact that Dante's sight,
improving, is moving up within the ^raggio~ (ray) that irradiates the
Rose, eventually to penetrate its source.  See the note to ^Paradiso~
XXXI.94-99.

	|145-148.~  Unlike Icarus (see the note to ^Par~. XV.54), Dante will
not trust his own wings, but will listen to Bernard, a more successful
"father" than Daedalus, perhaps because he recognizes the necessity of
the grace that Mary can help obtain.

	|145.~  The word ^ne~ is not a Latinism (^ne~ in Italian is a
pronominal particle meaning "of it" or "of them"), but a Latin
conjunction meaning "lest."

	|146.~  The neologism and hapax ^oltrarsi~ (move forward, advance),
nearly certainly forced by the requirement of rhyme, will be echoed in
the noun ^oltraggio~ in the next canto (verse 57).

	|149-150.~  Bernard uses the future tense as an imperative: "You shall
follow me...."  The implication is that Dante would not want to do
anything else but internalize his words.

	|151.~  The poet puts what clearly might have served as the opening
line of the next canto here, apparently to give Bernard an
uninterrupted presence at center stage for his prayer.  Momigliano
(comm. to 149-151) describes this canto-ending as one of the most
remarkable in the poem, "a long pause that sets apart, like a hush
falling over the congregation, the prayer that will be raised in the
holy atmosphere of the next canto."
