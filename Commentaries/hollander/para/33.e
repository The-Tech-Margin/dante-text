	|1-39.~  This much (and justly) celebrated passage, Bernard's prayer to
the Virgin, has the authority and unity of a separate poem.  This is
not to suggest that it is in any way incongruous in its context (quite
the opposite is true), only that it could be published (as surely it
has been) in an anthology of devotional lyrics and be one of the most
moving and commanding of the collection.

For a study of this passage, see Erich Auerbach ("Dante's Prayer to the
Virgin [^Par~. XXXIII] and Earlier Eulogies," ^Romance Philology~ 3
[1949]: 1-26), who aligns it with examples of classical and Christian
praise.  And for the large extent to which Dante has borrowed from
Bernard's own writings for the words of this prayer, see Mario Aversano
(^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent
by the author on 11 September 2001), pp. 173-76.

Gian Carlo Alessio, in a lecture he presented at Princeton University
during the autumn semester of 1981, broke down the rhetorical divisions
of Bernard's prayer as follows:

\<pre\>
1-12: 	^salutatio~
13-21:	^exordium~
22-27:	^narratio~
28-33:	^repetitio~
34-39:	^peroratio~
\</pre\>

The tone of intimacy found in this prayer is emphasized by its
extraordinary number of second-person-singular pronouns ^(tu, te, ti)~
and adjectives ^(tuo, tua)~, 17 of them in 39 verses (and that figure
does not include second-person-singular endings of verbs).  See the
note to ^Paradiso~ XXXI.79-90.

	|1.~  This verse establishes the basic modality of the entire canto,
making two references to what will be a common theme of so many verses
in it: harmonious resolution of impossibly related contraries.
"Virgin" and "mother" cannot logically be the shared properties of any
woman; nor can any woman be the daughter of her son.  This overriding
of the logic of impossibility will culminate in the final simile of the
poem, the geometer attempting to square the circle.  The only answer to
impossibility is miracle.  Reacting to the entire canto, G,untert has
said ("Canto XXXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
505): "No Christian poet had ever been so daring."

For the beginnings of the last cantos of the first two ^cantiche~, see
the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.1-3, which points out that each of the
previous opening lines was in another poetic voice, first that of
Venantius Fortunatus and second that of David, both of them speaking
Latin.  Here we have another poetic voice, that of St. Bernard, but he
does not use his customary Latin tongue (apparently no writing of
Bernard in French survives), but the vernacular.  This opening line
thus presents us, first with a completed pattern and then, on further
consideration, with a broken pattern: We expect Latin here, but do not
find it.  We may also speculate on the presence of another linguistic
program here.  We first hear the Latin of Venantius, then a Latin
"translation" of David's Hebrew, and finally Bernard's Italian, the
three main languages that provide the basic materials for Dante's own
literary making.

For both elements of this verse as dependent on formulations found in
the fifth book of Alain de Lille's ^Anticlaudianus~, see Giuseppe Ledda
(^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], p. 308n.), citing the
previous notice by Angelo Jacomuzzi ("'L'imago al cerchio'.  Nota sul
canto XXXIII del ^Paradiso~," in his ^L'imago al cerchio.  Invenzione e
visione nella "Divina Commedia"~ [Milan: Silva, 1968 {1965}], p. 12n.).
Ledda also reports other medieval ^formulae~ that are similar to
Dante's paradoxical expressions.

This marks the thirteenth time that a canto has begun with a speaker's
words (see the note to ^Par~. V.1).

	|2.~  If one had to choose a single line of the fourteen thousand two
hundred and thirty-three verses of the ^Commedia~ to stand for its
stylistic program, countering classical high style with Christian
^sermo humilis~, this one might serve that purpose.  It begins and ends
with the humanity of Mary, humble and a mere human creature, who is, at
the same time, lofty ^(alta)~, as is the poem itself.

	|3.~  See Carroll's explanation of this line (comm. to vv. 1-39): "The
woman worthy to be the 'Mother of God' must have been elect from the
beginning."

	|4-6.~  This tercet, remarkable for its triple play on the "making" of
flesh ^(fattore, farsi, fattura)~, rises to the heights with the hapax
(and coinage?) ^nobilitasti~ (ennobled).  What is the noblest act ever
done?  God's making himself mortal for our sake (cf. ^Par.~ VII.118-120).

Sapegno (comm. to vv. 4-6) cites Dante's previous praise of Mary in
^Convivio~ IV.v.5.

	|7.~  Dante's use of the word ^ventre~ (here and once earlier for
Mary's womb at ^Par~. XXXIII.104) was perhaps not intended to be
controversial.  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1-21), pointing out that
Dante may have deliberately been echoing "et benedictus fructus ventris
tui, Jesus" (blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus [originally found
in Luke 1:42]).  This is the end of the first part of the prayer:
"Hail, Mary, full of grace, / blessed are you among women."
Nonetheless, and as we have observed (see the notes to ^Par~. XXI.84
and XXIII.104), some of Dante's readers find this a lowering of diction
unbefitting such a lofty subject.  And the first ten of Dante's uses of
the word (8 in ^Inferno, 2 in~ Purgatorio) are all negatively charged,
since the term is associated with Cerberus (Inf. VI.17), the Harpies
(Inf. XIII.14), Aruns (Inf. XX.46), reptilian transformations (Inf.
XXV.74), the counterfeiters (Inf. XIXX.67), Capocchio (Inf. XXX.30),
Master Adam (Inf. XXX.123), the giants (Inf. XXXI.47), the ^femmina
balba~ (Purg. XIX.32), and the bellies afflicted with pain for eating
of the tree (Purg. XXXII.45).

In a related and similar vein, see Martin McLaughlin (^Literary
Imitation in the Italian Renaissance: The Theory and Practice of
Literary Imitation in Italy from Dante to Bembo~ [Oxford: Clarendon
Press, 1995], pp. 20-21), remarking that "After Petrarch reasserts the
absolute superiority of Latin over the ^volgare~, Dante's vernacular
echoes of classical ^auctores~ are regarded as a diminution of their
status."

On the word ^amore~, see Aleardo Sacchetto ("Il canto XXXIII del
^Paradiso~," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier,
1974], pp. 265-87), for whom love is the key to the poem, occurring
nineteen times in ^Inferno~, fifty in ^Purgatorio~, and eighty-five in
^Paradiso~.

	|8-9.~  Christ's sacrifice was the evidence of the rekindling of God's
love for humankind, resulting in the saved souls that populate the Rose.

	|10-12.~  For the elevation of Mary found here (and in all this
passage), see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-39): "[Dante] must have been
familiar with the distinction of Aquinas between ^latria~, the worship
due to God; ^dulia~, the veneration given to saints and Angels; and
^hyperdulia~, the higher veneration given to Mary, as the most exalted
of creatures (^Summa~, II-II, q. 103, a. 3, 4)."  See two earlier
commentators who also cite this threefold distinction, if without
tracing it to Aquinas: Guido da Pisa (comm. to verse 48) and John of
Serravalle (comm to vv. 106-111).

	|11-12.~  For the saved, there is no more need for hope -- their hope
(as well as their faith) has been rewarded, and now they only love
eternally.  Meanwhile, while to those (few, we need to recall, lest we
get carried away by the warmth of these verses) left on earth who will
be saved, Mary offers the surest path of hope for their salvation.

	|14-15.~  Campi (comm. to vv. 13-15) cites Monsignor Cavedoni for the
attribution of this image to St. Bernard, ^Sermones in Vigilia
Nativitatis Domini~ III.10: "Nihil nos Deus habere voluit, quod per
Mariae manus non transiret" (God does not wish us to have anything that
has not first passed through the hands of Mary).

	|15.~  Geoffrey Chaucer, who knew and understood this poem better than
any English writer for many centuries, appropriated this line in his
^Troilus~ with hilarious result.  Stanza 182 of Book III (one stanza
from the numerical midpoint of the work, 588 of 1178 stanzas) has
Troilus in the midst of his three-stanza prayer to Venus (his "Mary").
Whoever wants to accomplish his love (he is thinking about carnal
pleasure), he says, without Venus's help, "his desire will fly without
wings," that is, will not be successful.  It is ^Paradiso~ XXXIII done
as ^Some Like It Hot~, one of Billy Wilder's greatest films.  (That
Chaucer could do Dante "straight" is witnessed in many of his texts; in
the context of this canto, see particularly his rewriting of the first
half of Bernard's prayer in "The Second Nun's Prologue" of ^The
Canterbury Tales~, vv. 29-77.)

As Simone Marchesi, in conversation, has pointed out, Chaucer's Billy
Wilder was Giovanni Boccaccio, whose lascivious Venetian friar Albert
(^Decam~. IV.ii), in illicit pleasure with a Venetian matron, "flew
many times without his wings."  Albert appears to the credulous woman
as the angel Gabriel, decked out in a costume including wings that he
takes off only in the darkness of her bedroom.  Boccaccio is clearly
pulling Dante's leg; now Chaucer does so also.

	|17-18.~  For liberality extending itself unrequested, see ^Purgatorio~
XVII.59-60 and ^Paradiso~ XVII.75.

	|19-20.~  Here we have a case of a Virgilian borrowing that has
apparently remained hidden for centuries (in both texts, CAPITALS mark
structural parallels and ^italics~ indicate secondary repeated sounds
of ^te~):

  In TE misericordia, in TE pieta^te~,
  in TE magnificenza, in TE s'aduna...

See ^Georgics~ IV.465-466 (Orpheus lamenting his dead Eurydice, a scene
Dante has revisited in ^Purg~. XXX.49-51 [see the note to that passage]
as parallel to his plaint for lost Virgil, as is fairly widely agreed
these days):

  TE, dulcis coniunx, TE solo in litore secum,
  TE venien^te~ die, TE deceden^te~ canebat.

This seems an obvious revisitation.  Perhaps we have not seen it
because the situations are so opposed.  But that is the point: Bernard
is a better Orpheus singing a better Eurydice, Maria.  It is a small
but telling emblem of how Dante rewrites Virgilian tragedy as Christian
comedy.  And the Virgilian context is striking: We last heard the notes
of ^Georgics~ IV in tragic mode for his disappearance as a character
from the poem; now that poem becomes the subtext for a better moment,
his own re-entry to this Christian comedy at its highest point.
However, notice of this echo is fairly recent.  See Hollander ("Le
opere di Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella
scola" della poesia: Autorit@a e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci
[Ravenna: Longo, 1993], p. 339), citing a communication from Professor
Rachel Jacoff in 1987, suggesting the existence of this borrowing,
which also possibly reflects ^Paradiso~ XXIII.88-89, where Dante
presents himself as praying to Mary each morning and evening, while
Orpheus presents himself as "singing" Eurydice morning and evening.
The stark contrast between Virgilian "Orphic" love that leads to death
and Marian affection that leads to eternal life could not be more
striking.

We may remember that the first (and only) time we heard Dante's name in
this poem (^Purg~. XXX.55), it was echoing a passage just a little
farther along in this ^Georgic~ (see the note to ^Purg~. XXX.63).

The reader may be pleased to know of the existence of ^Virgil in Late
Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance~, an online
bibliography assembled by David Wilson-Okamura and graciously provided
to scholars and anyone else interested with no bothersome encumbrance:
\<a href=\"\"http://www.virgil.org/bibliography/virgil-bibliography.htm\"\"\>http://www.virgil.org/bibliography/virgil-bibliography.htm\</a\>.
The bibliography is updated on occasion, with the last version (as of 6
April 2006) dating from 6 February 2006.  While the rest of the world
argues over Google's desire simply to take and distribute other
people's intellectual property, some scholars have dedicated themselves
to sharing the fruits of their labor with others without a thought of
financial reward.

	|22-23.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) rightly express surprise
that there is any debate at all over exactly which of the souls in
which parts of the afterworld Bernard refers to, since he obviously
refers to all of them.

	|22.~  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 22-24) hears an echo of the word ^lacuna~
in Virgil: ^Georgics~ III.365.  Giuseppe Velli ("Petrarca, Dante, la
poesia classica: 'Ne la stagion che'l ciel rapido inchina' [^RVF~, L]
'Io son venuto al punto de la rota' [^Rime~, C]," ^Studi petrarcheschi~
15 [2002.1]: p. 92) also connects this passage with ^Rime~ C.60-61.

	|28-33.~  The first notice of a possible Virgilian source here is found
in Gabriele (comm. to vv. 31-32).  Tasso's notes to the poem (comm. to
verse 31) have a non-specified Virgilian source in mind, but very
likely the same one as Gabriele.  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 31-33) is
unhesitating in his identification of the source.  Campi (comm. to vv.
31-33) and Tozer (comm. to vv. 31-32) also point to this passage in the
^Aeneid~.  Toward the close of his long note to verses 1-39, Carroll
takes fuller notice of II.604-606.  It may be worth a moment's
consideration of this not exactly obvious "citation."  Among the
moderns, Mattalia (comm. to vv. 31-32) and Aversano (^Dante daccapo~
[glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on
11 September 2001, p. 175) are among the few who cite Virgil's text
here.  See ^Aeneid~ II.602-606;622-623: Venus will tear away the clouds
that keep Aeneas from seeing that it is neither Helen nor Paris, but
the ^gods~ who are destroying Troy:

\<pre\>
		  divum inclementia, divum,
has evertit opes sternitque a culmine Troiam.
aspice (namque amnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti
mortalis hebetat visus tibi et umida circum
caligat, nubem eripiam....
apparent dirae facies inimicaque Troiae
numina magna deum.

[the gods, the relentless gods, overturn this
wealth and make Troy topple from her pinnacle.
Behold, for all the cloud, which now, drawn
over thy sight, dulls thy mortal vision and with
dark pall enshrouds thee, I will tear away....
Dread shapes came to view -- mighty powers
divine, warring against Troy.   (Tr. H.R. Fairclough)]
\</pre\>

Vellutello and Daniello, and, more recently, Singleton (all three in
their comms. to vv. 28-33), and Chiavacci Leonardi (^Paradiso, con il
commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1997], p. 911) have another
choice, Boethius (^Consolatio~ III.m9.25-28):

\<pre\>
Dissice terrenae nebulas et pondera molis
Atque tuo splendore mica!  Tu namque serenum,
Tu requies tranquilla piis, te cernere finis,
Principium, vector, dux, semita, terminus idem.

[Cast off the earthly weight wherewith I am opprest,
Shine as Thou art most bright, Thou only calm and rest
To pious men whose end is to behold Thy ray,
Who their beginning art, their guide, their bound, and way. (tr. in Singleton)]
\</pre\>

It is interesting to find Daniello divagating from his teacher's
(Gabriele's) view of this problem.

If we believe that the Virgilian passage is being alluded to, the
parallels are fairly inviting.  Where Venus removes the shield of
invisibility from the gods so that Aeneas may see his true enemies for
what they are, Mary takes the cloud of his mortality away from Dante so
that he may see his friend, God, as He is.

	|29-39.~  These verses contain six words for praying, the densest
occurrence of noun and verb forms of ^priego~ in the poem.

	|33.~  Once again the precise understanding one should have of the
verbal noun ^piacer~ is an issue.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~
XXXI.47-54.  Grabher (comm. to vv. 28-33) believes that here it means
^somma bellezza~ (highest beauty), as do we.

	|34-39.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1-21), who observe that this
final prayer offered by Bernard may reflect the second and final part
of the ^Ave Maria~: "Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, / ora pro nobis
peccatoribus, nunc, / et in hora mortis nostrae.  Amen" (Holy Mary,
Mother of God, / pray for us sinners now / and at the hour of our
death.  Amen).

The traditional interpretation of these lines, as it is advanced by
Sapegno (comm. to these verses); by Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi
(comm. vv. 34-36); and by Peter Dronke ("The Conclusion of Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Italian Studies~ 49 [1994]: 28) fits well  with the
Marian text.  It sees the final moments of the prayer as turning to
Dante's ^Nachleben~ back on earth, and hoping that Mary will intervene
to help him remain pure, so that he will indeed be able to return here.
This understanding is opposed by Lino Pertile ("^Paradiso~ XXXIII:
l'estremo oltraggio," ^Filologia e critica~ 6 [1981]: 1-21); Giorgio
B@arberi Squarotti ("La preghiera alla Vergine: Dante e Petrarca,"
^Filologia e critica~ 20 [1995]: 367-71); and Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra
della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 309-10), all of whom find
it inappropriate for Bernard's prayer to leave the subject of Dante's
vision being pure for that of his post-Paradiso life back on earth being
morally sound.   Why is this an unseemly concern, either aesthetically
or intellectually?  It had already been before the reader in ^Paradiso~
XXXI.88-90, where Dante himself beseeches Beatrice for this kind of
heavenly assistance.  Pertile (p. 2) argues that, for the very reason
that Dante's prayer has been accepted, as signified by Beatrice's smile,
there is no longer any need to linger on this issue.  Perhaps so.
On the other hand, the language of these six verses (particularly at
vv. 36 and 37) really does seem to be related to earthly concerns.
In other words, even if it seems ungainly to some (but not to most),
the standard interpretation seems more plausible.

	|40-45.~  The Virgin, evidently made of more august stuff than
Beatrice, does not smile when Bernard finishes his prayer as Beatrice
did when Dante finished his (^Par~. XXXI.92), but indicates by the
expression in her eyes how much she is gratified by the prayers of the
devout.  Then she turns her gaze (as did Beatrice) back up to God.

	|46.~  As G,untert observes ("Canto XXXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 511), after the formal conclusion to
Bernard's prayer (vv. 40-45), this verse begins the final
"macrosequence" of the one-hundreth canto; it is precisely one hundred
verses in length.
However, for previous notice of what she characterizes as Dante's
"invisible ink," marking three segments for this final sub-section
of the poem (verse 75 = its thirtieth line; verse 105 = line 60;
verse 145 = line 100), see Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine Comedy~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992], pp. 255-56).

	|48.~  This verse has caused a central disagreement over its two main
potential meanings.  We follow Singleton's interpretation (comm. to
this verse): "The meaning of the verb in this verse is much debated,
but one aspect of that meaning seems beyond discussion: ^finii~ cannot
here be in a normal signification of 'bring to an end.'  Indeed, the
context requires that the meaning be the exact opposite, i.e., 'I
brought the ardor of my desire to its highest intensity.'"  And see the
similar position of Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse).  Another
difficult passage may be considered a "preview" of this one (^Purg~.
XVIII.31-33) and may help unscramble the sense of this line.  See the
note to that passage (^Purg~. XVIII.28-33).

	|49.~  As Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 177, points
out, this is the third and last appearance of Bernard's name in the
poem (see also ^Par~. XXXI.102 and 139), as a sort of Trinitarian
gesture of farewell.

	|50-51.~  Bernard was signaling, in his capacity as guide, what Dante
should be doing, but Dante was already doing exactly that.  He has not
outrun his need for guidance so much as he has internalized his guide.

	|52-54.~  The poet could not be more precise.  Up to now his powers of
sight have improved so that he can finally see God's reflection in the
universe perfectly, an ability that was far from his grasp when the
poem began.  Now he will see Him as Himself.  Thus the protagonist's
vision is about to move from reflections of His glory up into the beam
of light emanating from Him.  It is balanced for seconds between the
two aspects of deity, reflection and source (see the note to ^Par~.
XXIII.82-84).  In the next tercet we realize that he has recorded his
breakthrough.  No Christian except for St. Paul has seen so much -- or
such is the unspoken claim the poet makes us share.

	|55-57.~  The experience of seeing God face-to-face (1) is ineffable,
not describable, and (2) the vision cannot be remembered in any of its
details anyway (these twin disclaimers were made at the outset [see
^Par~. I.7-9]).  All that remains is the awareness of having had the
experience.

	|56.~  Petrocchi's selection of ^parlar mostra~ (instead of ^parlar
nostro~, among other possibilities) has not met with enthusiasm.  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.56.

	|57.~  For the word ^oltraggio~ as expressing Dante's version of the
^excessus mentis~ of the Christian mystical tradition, see Lino Pertile
("^Paradiso~ XXXIII: l'estremo oltraggio," ^Filologia e critica~ 6
[1981]: 1-21 [repr. in ^La punta del disio: Semantica del desiderio
nella "Commedia"~ [Fiesole: Cadmo, 2005]).

	|58-66.~  Given our previous experience reading in the ^Paradiso~, we
expect here exactly what we get.  Moving into an area of heightened
experience, which challenges his expressive powers (as it had
challenged his perceptive powers), Dante has inevitably moved to
simile.  After, in the last tercet, understating the fact that he saw
God, he now turns, not to one simile, but to three of them, in order to
express the nature of his loss.  This is perhaps the only time in the
poem that he deploys three similes back-to-back; in any case, the
Trinitarian nature of what he has looked upon (which will be made clear
to us before long) is perhaps reflected in their number.

These are the penultimate similes in a poem that turns to them more
often than we might have expected, and surely his use of the technique
reflects his sense of the classical Latin epic simile, so familiar to
him, particularly from the pages of Virgil.  And the last of these
three will be unmistakably Virgilian.

	|58-63.~  The first and fullest of the three similes is one of a class
defined by Tozer (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.136-141) as "drawn from
mental experiences."

	|58.~  The present tense of the verb in the simile seems natural to us,
since Dante usually bases his similes in the world of our present
experience.  We do not, however, expect to hear the narrative voice
speaking in the present tense -- but if we look ahead to verse 61, we
find the poet speaking to us now, from his writing table back on earth.
 He won't stay there (see vv. 133-138, offering a parallel structure,
in which the poet compares himself to the geometer and then says "such
^was~ I"), as we will see, but that is where he presents himself as
being now, at least for the moment.

	|61.~  Switching from the experience itself to writing about his
recording of the experience, the poet speaks in the present tense,
which comes as a surprise, since we have not heard him use that tense
in the Empyrean, and not since ^Paradiso~ XXX.34.

	|62-63.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 58-63) says that Dante is claiming
that even now he still tastes just a drop of this immense joy ^(adhuc
sentio aliquam stillam, idest, guttam illius immensae dulcedinis)~.

	|62.~  This is the sixth and final appearance of the word ^visione~,
used here for the first time for the poem itself.  It was apparently
from here that the many writers who referred to the work as the
^Visione~ (perhaps wanting to avoid the embarrassing [to some] title,
^Commedia~), took their cue.  And see the note to ^Paradiso~
XVII.127-129.

	|64.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 64-66) says that this is a fitting
simile, because "the human mind, weak and infirm, loses the form of its
phantasy's vision beneath the heat of the Eternal Sun."  This second
comparison is apparently not "literary" in its inspiration.  There is
in fact no citation of any text of any kind for this verse among the
commentators gathered in the DDP.

	|65-66.~  When we read her name, we may wonder why we have not heard it
before now; it is as though Dante were holding her in reserve for his
hundredth canto (as we will see, that number is three times associated
with her in the main passage involving her in the ^Aeneid~).  The
Sibyl, we may sometimes fail to remember, was merely the conduit for
Apollo's messages.  Thus, and as Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 64-66) says,
both the Sibyl and Dante lost track of a communication from a divinity.
 If we recall the first two cantos of this canticle, with their
insistence on Apollo as God's "stand-in" (^Par~. I.13; II.8), we can
see why Benvenuto makes them companions in losing track of the truth
revealed by "Apollo."

The history of the commentators' response to this Virgilian reference
is strange, beginning with the mistake of Francesco da Buti (or his
scribe), who identifies (comm. to vv. 55-66) the source as being in
^Aeneid~ V, when he clearly means ^Aeneid~ III.  All the other earlier
commentators, beginning with Pietro (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 58-66), and
including Benvenuto, John of Serravalle, Daniello, and Venturi, refer
only to the appropriate passage in ^Aeneid~ VI.  However, beginning
with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 64-66), every commentator but two refers
only to the passage in ^Aeneid~ III (443-451), which is the one in
which the usual scattering of her leaves is described; the second
passage, while also referring to that usual result, has Aeneas
convincing the oracle to speak, and not write, her expression of
Apollo's response.  However, it is probably helpful to have both scenes
in mind; the only two commentators in the DDP to refer to ^both~
passages are Oelsner and Singleton (comms. to these verses).

The passage in the ^Aeneid~ (VI.42-155) describing the Sibyl's cave is
both long and full of arresting "Dantean" detail.  The cave possesses
one hundred mouths and one hundred gates (VI.43); Aeneas requests that
the Sibyl ^not~ write her "poems" ^(carmina)~ on leaves to be scattered
by the wind, but recite them aloud (VI.74-75); the hundred gates open
and their breezes carry her reply (VI.81-82); she gives a prophecy
concerning the "first safe road" ^(via prima salutis)~, which in Latin
sounds, to the right listener, like a Christian message, "the first way
to salvation"; Virgil (VI.99) typifies her utterance as "horrible
enigmas" ^(horrendas ambages)~, a phrase that Dante has picked up in
^Paradiso~ XVII.31; Aeneas asks (VI.108) the Sibyl to bring him into
his father's sight ^(ad conspectum cari genitoris)~, while Dante hopes
to see his Father.  (While there are other resonances in Dante's poem
of the last four dozen verses, they are not relevant to this passage.)

If the obvious references to Virgil have been recognized, but not all
that well exploited, there is also possibly a reference to Augustine,
which has only rarely been noticed and not exploited at all.  It is
found in chapter xxiii of Book XVIII of ^De civitate Dei~, a text
vengefully hostile to Virgil for his prideful view of Rome's continuing
and sempiternal hegemony (especially now that the city has been sacked
in the year 410).  Augustine says that the Sibyl (not the Cumaean
[Virgil's] but the Erythraean -- if he later hedges by saying it ^may~
have been the Cumaean) had prophesied the coming of Christ and ought to
be considered as inhabiting the City of God.  What led Augustine to
make such claims may have been a desire to roast Virgil, either for not
heeding his own Sibyl (who, after all, presides over the fourth
^Eclogue~) or for choosing to sponsor the wrong one.  Here is a portion
of what he sets down in his lengthy analysis of this poem: The first
letters of each successive line in the Greek Sibylline pronouncement
spell out, Augustine reports: "'Jesus Christ the Son of God, the
Saviour.'  And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of three.
 For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to
rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven.
But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek words,... they
will make the word ^ikduj~, that is, 'fish,' in which word Christ is
mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist,
without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters"
(tr. M. Dods).  Should one want to gild the lily, one might note that
Dante's verse about the Sibyl, if it contains six words (and not five),
does in fact contain twenty-seven letters.  Notice of this passage in
St. Augustine is not a frequent feature of the commentaries.  However,
see Benvenuto (comm. to these verses), who points to it at some length.
 He is followed apparently only by Campi (comm. to these vv.).
Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1983], pp. 146-50), while suggesting this connection,
neglected his two precursors (when he could have used all the help he
could find).

For an article by Philippe Verdier on the Sibyl's appearance to
Augustine at ^Ara coeli~ in Rome, see ^M$elanges de l'$Ecole fran$caise
@a Rome~ 94 (1982): 85-119.  And for a collection of studies of the
Sibyl's antique and medieval presence, see Febo Allevi (^Con Dante e la
Sibilla ed altri [dagli antichi al volgare]~ [Milan: Edizioni
Scientifico-Letterarie, 1965]) as well as Monique Bouquet and
Fran$coise Morzadec (eds., ^La Sibylle: Parole et repr$esentation~
[Rennes: Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2004]).  Allevi discusses
this passage on pp. 443-48.

	|66.~  On the Sibyl's leaves, see Piero Boitani ("The Sibyl's Leaves: A
Study of ^Paradiso~ XXXIII," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]: 83-126), taking
them as a starting point for his ^lectura~ of the canto.

	|67-75.~  The word ^concetto~ (conception, conceiving) is the linchpin
of this passage, occurring in verses 68 and 75 (on the latter occasion
as a verb).  Dante, in this last of his nine invocations (see the note
to ^Inf~. II.7-9), asks God to make His reality "conceivable" by
mortals.  If He requites Dante's request, the poet promises, that will
be the result.  A scaled-back request, the poet insists, is all that he
makes, underlined by the repetition of the phrase "un poco" (one small
part).

This is the fourth time in the poem that the word ^concetto~ is
connected with an invocation (see the notes to ^Inf~. XXXII.1-9 and
10-12; ^Par~. XVIII.82-87; and, for a survey of all the presences of
^concetto~ in the poem, see the note to ^Par~. XXXIII.127).  It surely
seems to be involved in Dante's sense of what the human agent needs
from a higher source, not the mere substance of his vision, but its
shaping conceptual formulation.  And that is precisely what, the poet
will tell us, he was granted in the lightning bolt that resolves all
his questions in verses 140-141.

It is interesting to look back to the two uses of ^concetto~ in ^Convivio~. In
the first of these (I.v.12) Dante concludes that Latin possesses higher
conceptual power than the vernacular: "pi@u @e la vert@u sua che quella
del volgare". When, only shortly afterwards, he returns to the topic
(I.xiii.12), he seems to have revised that opinion. Speaking of the
vernacular, he says: "E noi vedemo che in ciascuna cosa di sermone
lo bene manifestare del concetto @e pi@u amato e commento." That
he first had held that highly significant utterance was possible only
in Latin stands in clear opposition to his eventual insistence on the
conceptual value of the vernacular throughout the ^Commedia~. The noun
^concetto~ appears first in ^Inferno~ XXXII.4 and then reappears ten more
times in the poem; in addition to its first two presences in this final
canto (once as noun and once as verb -- see the first paragraph of
this note), it reappears in the final tercets (vv. 122 and 127), once
again first as noun and then as verb. That four of their fewer than
twenty presences in the poem are found in its final canto underlines
the importance that Dante found in the words ^concetto~ and ^concepire.~

	|67.~  The poet here addresses God as source ^(O somma luce)~, not as
what He irradiates, but as the ^fonte~ (spring, font) of everything.

	|76-84.~  The protagonist had entered the ^raggio~ (ray) in verse 53.
Now he has issued from it and approached the source.  Having uttered
his ninth invocation a few lines earlier (vv. 67-75), he does not
invoke the Deity.  He does not ^need~ help to see Him any longer; he
has accomplished that goal.  And so he gives thanks for His grace in
allowing this final vision, which he is about to unfold before us.  See
discussion in Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo,
2002], pp. 313-14 and n.).

	|77.~  For the past presence of the adjective ^smarrito~ in the poem,
see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVI.9.

	|82.~   For an attempt to load the significance of the verb ^presunsi~
(presumed) by noting that it occurs in a verse the number of which (82)
resolves to 10 (8\+2) in a canto numbered 100, see Selene Sarteschi
("Sant'Agostino in Dante e nell'et@a di Dante," in her ^Per la
"Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 {1999}], p.
194n.).

	|85-93.~  For a most suggestive and yet concise reading of this
passage, the universe explained and put into relationship with its
Creator in three tercets, see Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of
Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], pp. 78-79).
God creates all things as unity.  He is the ground of all being.  And
Dante, seeing the universal diversity as unity, experiences it as God
saw it in creating it, as a simple yet "limitless and dimensionless
reality" (Moevs, p. 78).

	|85-90.~  On the various dimensions of this passage, from medieval book
production, in which a writer took his individual quartos ^(quaderni)~
to have them conflated and sewn into a "book,"  John Ahern ("Binding
the Book: Hermeneutics and Manuscript Production in ^Paradiso~ 33,"
^PMLA~ 97 [1982]: 800-9) argues that Dante's poem reflects the "book"
of God's created universe, even to its Trinitarian structure.  For
bibliography on the concept (God's "two books," the Bible and His
creation), see G,untert ("Canto XXXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 511n.).

	|85-87.~  Marguerite Mills Chiarenza ("The Imageless Vision and Dante's
^Paradiso~," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]: 80) says that this tercet is
"inspired by the doctrine of the double existence of creation, separate
in the universe and unified in its Creator's conception."

	|87.~  This is the final occurrence of the noun ^universo~ in the poem,
suggesting the "universality" of a poem that can record such totality.
The word was introduced to the poem by Francesca (^Inf~. V.91),
speaking of an "unfriendly" God as "king of the universe"; it then
appears four more times in ^Inferno~ and not at all in ^Purgatorio~.
It occurs eight times in ^Paradiso~, twice in the first and last cantos
(^Par~. I.2 and 105; ^Par~. XXXIII.23 and here).  However, we may
notice the only appearance of the word in any other form, the adjective
^universale~ at ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.91, which makes threefold the
presence of "universe"/"universal" uniquely in this ultimate canto (and
ninefold in the final canticle altogether).

	|91-93.~  G,untert ("Canto XXXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 508) would like to have us see "three Dantes" in this
tercet, the narrator ^(credo)~, the protagonist ^(i' vidi)~, and the
"post-vision protagonist" ^(mi sento... i' godo)~, a being somehow
differentiated from the narrator (see the similar argument advanced by
Picone ["Leggere la ^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Inferno~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
{Florence: Cesati, 2000}], pp. 18-21).  However, his separation of the
first and third voices cannot be supported, since they both use the
present tense and surely seem to be the ^io narrante~ rather than two
different voices, speaking from different times.  Since it is not
logically possible for that time to be post-writing, it must fall
between the vision and the writing, and thus in the past.  To put this
another way, had such been Dante's plan, he would have needed to deploy
a better-conceived tactic in order to make it effective.  As it is, we
have two moments in the poem, one stable (the protagonist's voyage
during a week in the spring of 1300), the other always in fact shifting
between circa 1307 and circa 1321, but treated without temporal
distinction as the authorial "now," if it has in fact finally reached
its farthest point.  Proust would later choose to dramatize the subject
of the author's mortal change through time; all times in which Dante,
on the other hand, looks up at us from his writing table are equally
"now."  In Hollander's formulation (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 227), "The Pilgrim he
was has become the history of the Poet he is."

For the similarities between Dante's "apotheosis" here and that of
Glaucus in ^Paradiso~ I.67-79, see Hollander (^Allegory~, pp. 228-29).
See also Eugene Longen ("The Grammar of Apotheosis: ^Paradiso~ XXX,
94-99," ^Dante Studies~ 93 [1975]: 209-14).

For the suggestion that this image of a ship, filled with armed men and
headed for battle, underlines the poet's desire to associate his
Christian poem with classical martial epic in this final reference to
the world of men, see Hollander ("Dante and the Martial Epic,"
^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989], p. 85).

	|94-96.~  This tercet has called forth equal amounts of admiration and
distress, admiration for the beauty and scope of its conception,
distress at the indubious difficulty of its highly compacted literal
sense.  First things first.  What does the tercet ^mean~?  Perhaps
because of the difficulty of understanding why Dante might have wanted
to present himself as ^forgetting~ the greatest insight he (or
practically anyone) has ever had, there has been some attempt to
understand ^letargo~, not as "forgetting," but as a form of visionary
experience.  However, most now think that the former meaning is far
more likely here, as, obviously, do we.  If all can agree (and that is
to assume a good deal) that the term, in Dante's Italian, refers to
oblivion, or forgetfulness, that still leaves a deal of difficulty.
For interesting considerations of this tercet, see Georg Rabuse ("'Un
punto solo m'@e maggior letargo,'" ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 43
[1965]: 138-52) and Peter Dronke ("Boethius, Alanus and Dante,"
^Romanische Forschungen~ 78 [1966]: 119-25).

A good place to begin one's study of this tercet is Scartazzini's gloss
on it, not because it solves its mysteries (it almost certainly does
not), but because it so thoroughly indicates what these are.  Francesco
da Buti's long gloss to this tercet (a part of his comm. to vv. 82-99)
makes a point based in mythographic history that stands as the basic
understanding even today.  He (uniquely) offers a striking version of
the classical background: Neptune had longed to see his "kingdom," the
sea, "inhabited" as was the land.  Therefore, he took great joy in
seeing the first ship, and has been painfully "forgetting" it (in the
sense that, without satisfaction, he longs to see it every day) for
2,500 years ever since.  Thus Dante's one minute of awareness, now
lost, is more painful than Neptune's far longer period.  See Tozer's
similar explanation (comm. to this tercet): "'[O]ne single moment is
greater oblivion to me (^letargo~, lit. lethargy, dullness), than
twenty-five centuries have been to the enterprise which caused Neptune
to marvel at the shadow of ^Argo~.'  In other words: 'I forgot in a
single moment more of what I saw... than men have forgotten, in
twenty-five centuries, of the Argonautic expedition.'  The reason why
this expedition is mentioned is that it was the earliest important
event recorded in history."  Needless to say, there are other views.
For instance, Chimenz (comm. to this tercet) believes that the
twenty-five centuries are marked by remembrance, not by forgetting.
Others have noted that the structure of the passage simply forces the
reader to accept the painful understanding (i.e., the view advanced by
Tozer).  And if the poet goes on to describe the vision in great detail
(the main point put forward by those who read the text "positively"),
he also will insist on its fleetingness, as Carroll (comm. to this
tercet), objecting to Scartazzini's "positive" interpretation, rightly
argues.  Lombardi had offered, in addition to the classical modern
statement later found in Tozer, two important additions to the sum of
commentary knowledge: the word ^letargo~ derives from Greek ^lethe~
(forgetfulness), and the years between the voyage of the ^Argo~ and
1300 are, according to Dante's authorities, either 2,523 or 2,570.
Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) supports the first of these dates,
which has now become "canonical" among the commentators.  Either one is
a promising date, since both sector the "history of sea voyages" in an
arc of twenty-six centuries, 1223 (or 1270) B.C. to 1300, with its
approximate midpoint in the Incarnation (as Hollander [^Allegory in
Dante's "Commedia"~ {Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}, pp.
231-32] has argued).  The voyage of the Argonauts, preceding the Trojan
War, was the first important event in the Greek portion of universal
history.  (See Hermann Gmelin [^Kommentar: das Paradies~ {Stuttgart:
Klett, 1957}, p. 572] for an examination of Dante's Argonautical
chronology.)

For a different and not ultimately convincing possible source, see
Giacalone (comm. to vv. 94-96) citing Parodi (^BSDI~ 23 [1916], p. 66)
for the latter's citation of Statius (^Achilleid~ I.20-26): Thetis
looks up from her home in the sea at the oars of the ship bearing Paris
and Helen to Troy, a voyage that will eventually result in the death of
Achilles.

	|94.~  See Angelo Jacomuzzi ("'L'imago al cerchio'.  Nota sul canto
XXXIII del ^Paradiso~," in his ^L'imago al cerchio.  Invenzione e
visione nella "Divina Commedia"~ [Milan: Silva, 1968 {1965}], p. 10),
discussing the tension in this canto between ^letargo~ (forgetting) and
the frequent presence of verbs for seeing.  And see Picone ("Dante
argonauta: la ricezione dei miti ovidiani nella ^Commedia~," in M.
Picone and B. Zimmermann, eds., ^Ovidius redivivus: von Ovid zu Dante~
[Stuttgart: M&P Verlag, 1994], pp. 200-202).

	|95.~  The word ^impresa~ (undertaking, enterprise) has an interesting
history in the poem.  See Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 230-31), pointing
out that, in ^Inferno~ II.41 and 47, the word refers to Dante's journey
and that, in ^Inferno~ XXXII.7, it represents Dante's poem about that
journey; here, on the other hand, it would seem to refer both to the
journey and to the record of that journey, for the first is in process
of becoming the second.

	|96.~  According to Ovid, Jason was the builder of the first ship
("primaeque ratis molitor" [^Metam~. VIII.302]).  For the ^Argo~ in
Lucan (^Phars~. II.715-718), see Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv.
94-96) and Lombardi (comm. to vv. 94-96), a possible, but not
immediately convincing, "echo."  For still another Jasonic presence in
Ovid, see ^Amores~ II.xi.1-2.  For the history of the ^Argo~-motif, see
Ernst Robert Curtius ("The Ship of the Argonauts," in ^Essays on
European Literature~, tr. M. Kowal [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1973 {1950}], pp. 465-96), favoring Ovid (^Metam~. VII.120),
which assuredly lies behind Dante's earlier reference to Jason's voyage
(see the note to ^Par~. II.17-18), but does not seem quite so good a
fit here.

The image of Neptune looking up from beneath the sea is reminiscent of
what the poet tells us in Canto XXXI.73-78, where he looked up at
Beatrice as though he were immersed in the deepest point in the sea and
she were at the highest point in the earth's atmosphere.  Both
sightings involve the word ^effige~ (features), the first time as
Beatrice's likeness, the second (^Par~. XXXIII.131), that of Jesus.
The fact that Neptune saw the shadow ^(ombra)~ of the ^Argo~ makes it
at least probable that the poet hoped we would consider that voyage as
the prefiguration of his own (see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ {Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}], p. 232).

And as for Ovidian inspiration for what is sometimes considered a
Dantean invention, Hollander (p. 222) has argued for the impact of the
last line (721) of Ovid's Book VI, describing the Argo setting sail
from Iolcos: "Per mare non notum prima petiere carina" (The first keel
to cleave an unknown sea).  That would leave Neptune alone unaccounted
for.  To be sure, we find him looking up from the seabed (wherever
Dante found the source of the image) earlier in this very poem,
^Inferno~ XXVIII.83-84, where, in his only other appearance, he
witnesses Malatestino's treachery as he has witnessed similar crimes on
the part of Greeks ^(gente argolica)~, the "bad Argonauts" succeeding
Jason, as it were.

	|97.~  For Dante's "sospesa," Etienne Gilson ("La conclusion de la
^Divine Com$edie~ et la mystique franciscaine," ^R$evue d'histoire
franciscaine~ 1 [1924], p. 59) cites the prologue of Bonaventure's
^Itinerarium mentis in Deum~ for a similar use of the word ^suspensio~
to denote the mind's ecstatic rapture in its contemplation of God.

	|98.~  When Dante looked at Beatrice in Eden, the angels cried out
(^Purg~. XXXII.9) that he was "troppo fiso!" (too fixed), in the sense
that he was confounding the physical and the spiritual in his
appreciation of Beatrice.  Now there can be no question of that, since
"fixation" on God is the condition of blessedness for eternity, as the
following two tercets make absolutely plain.

	|100-105.~  Not only is the intellect satisfied by gazing on God, but
the will is, too; for what other good, as object of the will, can
supervene?

	|106-108.~  For a final time, the poet, having nearly completed a poem
that has just reported having seen and understood the underlying
principle ordering the entire universe, insists that, compared to the
truth of that vision, his work is mere babytalk.  See the note to
^Par~. XV.121-123 and Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in
^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), pp. 115-29.

	|111-114.~  Preparing us to see the Trinity through his eyes, the poet
reassures us that he harbors no heretical notions about God's
nature(s); if He is three, that does not mean that He is other than
one; if He is one, that does not mean that He is other than three.
Even the protagonist's vastly improved powers still have one more stage
of visionary capacity to reach, one in which he will be able to
experience the unchanging Trinity with his changed sight.

	|115-117.~  The Trinity is first experienced as three circles inhering
in a single space, distinguished only by their colors, not their sizes,
which are identical.

	|116-120.~  Danilo Bonanno ("Guido in Paradiso: ^Donna me prega~ e
l'ultimo canto della ^Commedia~," ^Critica del testo~ 4 [2001], p. 224)
suggests that the rhymes here deliberately echo those found in ^Donna
me prega,~ vv. 51-55 ^(miri~, ^tiri~, ^giri)~, with subversive intent,
and indeed sees the entire final canto as entering into a corrective
debate with the understanding of the nature of love proposed in
Cavalcanti's ^canzone~.

	|118-120.~  The tercet, as characterized by Carroll (comm. to vv.
115-123), as presenting "what Aquinas calls the Relations of Divinity
according to the Procession of Persons out of identity of substance --
the Relations of Paternity, Generation and Spiration (^Summa~, I, q.
28).  From the circle of the Father appeared reflected the circle of
the Son, as Iris [rainbow] from Iris [rainbow]; and from both was
breathed forth equally the fire of Love which is the Holy Spirit (on
the Procession of the Spirit from both Father and Son, and the
^filioque~ controversy, see above, [Carroll's comm.] on ^Par~. X.1-6).
We must not think of these in the form of three rainbows one within
another, or even as the three colours of a rainbow, for these are also
one within another.  The 'one dimension' shows that Dante conceived of
them as co-existing in the one space, though he does not explain how he
was able to see the three colours distinct within each other."  One
supposes that they manifested themselves as changing colors.  Dante
does not assign a particular color either to Father or Son; the Holy
Spirit, as Love, is understandably red.

	|121.~  For this last use of ^fioco~ (weak, indistinct) in the poem,
see Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~
[Florence: Olschki, 1983]), tying together ^Vita nuova~ XXIII (see pp.
76-77), ^Inferno~ I.63, and this verse (pp. 150-51).  For a similar
view, see Corrado Bologna ("Canto XXX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 461).  Torraca seems to have been the first
commentator (and, among those gathered in the DDP, he seems to have
been followed only by Mestica [comm. to this tercet]) even to note that
we have seen this term before in ^Inferno~ I.63, but has no further
comment.  Hollander suggests that "this use of the word is intended to
make us consider Virgil's initial ^fiochezza~, with all its metaphoric
insistence on the fact that he had failed to speak the Word.  In this
respect, the two poets find themselves once again together at the end,
reunited in their failures, and yet so very far from one another,
separated by the ground of their failures" (p. 151).

Saverio Bellomo ("Il canto XXX del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996]:
55n.) believes that the question of Dante's Virgil needs to be
reopened, beginning with a rereading of Bruno Nardi (^Dal "Convivio"
alla "Commedia"~, con premessa alla ristampa di O. Capitani [Rome:
Istituto Storico Italiano per il Medio Evo, 1992 {1960}], esp. pp.
96-150).

	|124-126.~  Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo,
2002], p. 317n.) says he is following Jacomuzzi in seeing that the
protagonist's final vision is of the Incarnation, and not the Trinity.
Does one really have to make that choice?  It would seem to be
preferable to see it as Trinitarian, which includes the vision of Jesus
as spirit in flesh, as He is.

	|127-132.~  Finally, Dante sees the Humanity of the Trinity, the Son,
Jesus Christ, incarnate within the circle that abstractly represents
the Second Person.  Once again the differing colors of the Persons are
insisted on, and once again (see the note to vv. 118-120) Dante does
not report the color of the Son (nor of the Father).

It took centuries until a commentator (Scartazzini [comm. to verse
131]) realized that this image contained a reference to St. Paul
(Philippians 2:7), "but made himself nothing, taking the form of a
servant, being born in the likeness of men."  This is currently a
fairly widespread perception, but the only other writer in the DDP to
observe it is Grandgent (comm. to verse 131).  The enormous presence of
the Bible in the poem has at times simply overwhelmed its observers.
This is a case in point.  Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series:
^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969
{1896}], pp. 321-34) lists over six hundred possible citations in all
Dante's works, the bulk of them in the ^Commedia~.  Thus one needs to
deal cautiously with George Steiner's accountancy (^Grammars of
Creation~ [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001], p. 89), which
counts the actual citations (rather than more general forms of
reference) as two in ^Inferno~, eight in ^Purgatorio~, and a dozen in
^Paradiso~.

See also Peter Dronke ("'Orizzonte che rischiari,'" in his ^Dante and
Medieval Latin Traditions~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986
{1975}], pp. 7-8), arguing that this, too (see ^Par~. XIV.67-78 and the
note to that passage), is a reference to Joachim's three Ages,
represented by three circles in the ^Liber figurarum~.

	|127.~  This is the final use of this word, whether as an abstract noun
meaning "concept" or "conceiving" or a transitive verb (to conceive [an
idea -- see ^Inf~. XII.13 for the first and only use of the verb to
mean "to conceive offspring," although there is more than an overtone
of that sense here]).  There have been twelve previous uses of the noun
or of the verb (^Inf~. XXVI.73, XXXII.4; ^Par~. III.60, XV.41,
XVIII.86, XIX.12, XXII.33, XXIV.60, XXIX.81 and 132, XXXIII.68 and
122), which has more uses in this canto than in any other (three).  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XV.40-42.  See also Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra
della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 316-19).

[Florence: Cesati, 2004], p. 174n.) as synthesizing Platonism and
Aristotelianism.   And see Christopher Ryan ("The Theology of Dante,"
in ^The Cambridge Companion to Dante~, ed. R. Jacoff [Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1993], p. 136) for the point (which he
presents as being more than a quibble) that the final vision in the
poem is not one of the Trinity (the usual understanding) but of the
humanity of Jesus.  Ryan is correct that this is not a quibble;
however, he is probably not correct about the nature of the vision.
The final vision is of the Trinity, which includes Jesus -- in both His
natures.  See the note to vv. 124-126.

	|131.~  For notice of a possible reflection here of the fourth and
final stage of loving God in St. Bernard's ^De diligendo Deo~, see
Hollander (^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), p. 35 (repr. of
"The Invocations of the ^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of Italian Studies~ 3
[1976]: 235-40): "Commentators have for a long time annotated this
passage with a reference to Philippians 2:7" (as we have seen [see the
note to vv. 127-132], that is barely true; only two of them in the last
150 years).  Hollander goes on to show that Bernard, in ^De diligendo
Deo~ (^Sancti Bernardi Opera~, ed. J. Leclercq and H.M. Rochais, Vol.
III [Rome: Editiones Cistercienses, 1963], p. 142), resorts to the same
Pauline passage in a highly similar context, describing the height of
the mystical love of God, when one loves oneself in God.  For Bernard's
four stages in the love of God and their possible relation to the
stages in the ^Comedy~ (first suggested by a student at Princeton,
Donald J. Mathison, in 1968), see the note to ^Purgatorio~
XXVII.139-141.  For later discussions that are in agreement, see
Francesco Mazzoni ("San Bernardo e la visione poetica della ^Divina
Commedia~," in ^Seminario Dantesco Internazionale: Atti del primo
convegno tenutosi al Chauncey Conference Center, Princeton, 21-23
ottobre 1994~, ed. Z.G. Baranski [Florence: Le Lettere, 1997], p. 176)
as well as Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~
[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], p. 81.  And see E.G. Gardner
(^Dante and the Mystics~ [London: Dent, 1913], p. 118) for the relation
of ^De diligendo Deo~ X.27-28 to Dante's spiritual preparedness for the
final vision.

	|133.~  For a study of this penultimate simile, a meditation on how
Dante may be said to have "squared the circle," see Ronald Herzman and
Gary Towsley ("Squaring the Circle: ^Paradiso~ 33 and the Poetics of
Geometry," ^Traditio~ 49 [1994]: 95-125).  See also Giuseppe Ledda (^La
guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], p. 317n.).

	|137-138.~  See Richard Kay ("Vitruvius and Dante's Giants," ^Dante
Studies~ 120 [2002], pp. 30-31) for the notion, advanced as a follow-up
to his examination of the Vitruvian nature of Dante's calculations of
the dimensions of both the giants (^Inf~. XXX) and of Satan (^Inf~.
XXXIV), that what Dante sees is Vitruvius's image of man inscribed in a
circle, his ^umbelicus~ at the center of the circle, his fingers and
toes at the circumference, in what is the eventual model for Leonardo
da Vinci's far more famous design.  As charming as this notion is, the
word ^effige~ in Dante (^Par~. XXXI.77, XXXIII.131) seems rather to
indicate, as is generally the case in Italian, the visage, not the
whole human body.

	|138.~  Angelo Jacomuzzi ("'L'imago al cerchio'.  Nota sul canto XXXIII
del ^Paradiso~," in his ^L'imago al cerchio.  Invenzione e visione
nella "Divina Commedia"~ [Milan: Silva, 1968 {1965}], pp. 5-27) offers a
reading of these verses and of the poem as a whole in the mode of a
theologically determined fourfold allegoresis.  For discussion, with
some bibliography, of Italian and American treatments of theological
allegory in the poem, see Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New
Haven: Yale University Press, 2001], pp. 37-39 and p. 188, nn. 55-57).

	|139-141.~  For insistence on the role played, in this final vision, of
both the ^Benjamin major~ of Richard of St. Victor and the ^Itinerarium
mentis in Deum~ of Bonaventure, see Etienne Gilson ("La conclusion de
la ^Divine Com$edie~ et la mystique franciscaine," ^R$evue d'histoire
franciscaine~ 1 [1924]), pp. 56-57).  Gilson (pp. 62-63) concludes
that, given these two sources, Dante's vision is not a Pauline ^raptus~
(a function of the intellect), but a Franciscan ^exstasis~ (a function
of the affective capacity).  This, however, and despite Gilson's
authority, is not the general current opinion, which rather insists
that Dante did have a Pauline ^raptus~ (as the entire ^cantica~ has
been preparing us to grant).  For instance, G,untert ("Canto XXXIII,"
in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 507) cites Aquinas
(^ST~ II-II, q. 175, a. 3), distinguishing among three kinds of vision
(but for an earlier and similar treatment see Pertile ["^Paradiso~
XXXIII: l'estremo oltraggio," ^Filologia e critica~ 6 {1981}: 1-21],
pp. 6-7).  After discussions that are in strong agreement with
positions taken on the issues by Augustine, Thomas explains, in his
Reply to Objection 1: "Man's mind is rapt by God to the contemplation
of divine truth in three ways.  First, so that he contemplates it
through certain imaginary pictures ^(per similitudines quasdam
imaginarias)~, and such was the ecstasy that came upon Peter [Acts
10:10-16].  Secondly, so that he contemplates the divine truth through
its intelligible effects ^(per intelligibiles effectus)~; such was the
ecstasy of David, who said (Psalm 115 [116]:11): 'I said in my excess:
Every man is a liar.'  Thirdly, so that he contemplates it in its
essence ^(in sua essentia)~.  Such was the rapture of Paul, as also of
Moses; and not without reason, since as Moses was the first Teacher of
the Jews, so was Paul the first 'Teacher of the gentiles'" (tr. from
the website of the ^Catholic Encyclopedia~).  It is typical of Gilson,
a Dominican himself, to downplay the importance of Dominicans in favor
of Franciscans.  His graciousness is a model to us all.  However, it
may be that he is simply incorrect here.  The reader will note that
here, even at the conclusion of the great poem, commentators are
divided among Franciscan and Dominican positions on the issues.  For
the difficult history of the intertwined strands of knowledge and love
in St. Thomas, in whom, at least apparently, such distinctions would be
clearer than they are in Dante, see Michael Sherwin (^By Knowledge and
By Love: Charity and Knowledge in the Moral Theology of St. Thomas
Aquinas~ [Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 2005]).  In
Dante, we find at moments, like this one, knowledge eclipsing the
claims of love; at others, that dynamic would seem to be reversed.  One
comes away with the feeling that Dante responds fully to the main
competing voices in this continuing dialectic, "Franciscans" (Francis
himself, Bonaventure, Bernard, and perhaps Joachim as well), who
privilege love (but not ^against~ knowledge), and "Dominicans" (Thomas
^primissimus inter impares~, but Albertus Magnus and Remigius Girolamus
as well), who privilege knowledge (but not ^against~ love).

For the distinction between seeing face to face, as did Paul and lesser
forms of a similar experience, see Gabriele Muresu ("Lo specchio e la
contemplazione [^Paradiso~ XXI]," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996]: 23n.),
comparing the higher nature of the contemplation available in Heaven to
what was available to Dante in Eden, when he sees Christ as griffin in
^Purgatorio~ XXIX.108.

	|142-145.~  The final four lines are divided into two parts, the first
referring to an apparent failure ("Here my exalted vision lost its
power"), in which the protagonist/poet, so recently rewarded with the
comprehension of Everything (verse 141), loses that vision, which is
blotted out by his reemergent humanity.  And then the poem's final
sentence, begun with an adversative, ^ma~ (but), tells a quite
different story: the protagonist's interior motions, that of his
affective power (the will) and that of his intellective power (his
transmuted desire), both move in harmony with God's cosmos.

	|142.~  See the ^Grande Dizionario~ for a definition of ^facolt@a~:
"the property of every being endowed with sense to perceive, revive,
and represent in the soul sensations, perceptions, impressions, and
images."  On ^fantasia~ and ^imaginazione~, see Giulio Lepschy
("Fantasia e immaginazione," ^Lettere Italiane~ 38 [1987]: 20-34).  And
see the notes to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.13-18 and 25.

	|143.~  For discussion of Dante's use of Latin in the poem, including
this final instance, see the note to ^Paradiso~ IV.25.

	|144.~  Lino Pertile (^La punta del disio: Semantica del desiderio
nella "Commedia"~ [Fiesole: Cadmo, 2005], pp. 265-8 - reprint of the
article published in 1995 [pp. 133-35]) reopens the question of the
meaning of this final image.  The vast majority of readers have
believed that Dante has a single wheel in mind (none more exigently and
at greater length than Bruno Nardi [^Nel mondo di Dante~ {Rome:
Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura"}, 1944], pp. 337-50), all places on
which move with uniform regularity.  Pertile revives the view of those
few twentieth-century readers who saw the tautological vacuity of this
as a final image and, revisiting Ezechiel (1:19-21 and 10:16) and
Boethius (^Cons~. II.m8.28-30), revives a better idea: Dante has ^two~
wheels in mind.  Aversano (^Dante e gli "scritti" di San Francesco~
[Salerno: Palladio, 1984], pp. 203-6) also finds the source in Ezechiel
(1:15-21), but in order to make a different point.  For him Ezechiel's
four beasts, traditionally interpreted as the four Gospels, imply the
^Commedia~ as a "fifth wheel," since it also is dictated by the Holy
Spirit.  But see John Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed.
Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986], pp. 246-50
of an essay entitled "The Final Image," first published in 1964), for
whom there is but one wheel, despite the fact that he thinks it
reflects Ezechiel's wheel within a wheel, which would seem to indicate
two wheels.
For an article that strongly supports the notion that Dante was closely
aware of the text of Ezechiel, see Filippo Bognini, "Gli occhi di Ooliba:
Una proposta per ^Purg~. XXXII 148-60 e XXXIII 44-45," ^Rivista
di Studi Danteschi~ 7 (2007): 73-103.

For a new wrinkle, see Sandra Rizzardi ("Dante e l'orologio," ^Studi e
problemi di critica testuale~ 60 [2000]: 51-70), who makes a case for
Dante's having an image in mind that would become a staple in later
ages: the universe as the movements in a mechanical clock.  She
bolsters her argument by pointing back to previous clock imagery (at
^Purg~. VIII.85-87; ^Par~. X.139-146 and ^Par~. XXIV.13-18).  Professor
Steven Marcus, in a conversation that took place in November 2002,
independently suggested this solution.  For a similar observation,
although one not made with this passage in mind (rather ^Par~.
XIV.106-111), see Steven Botterill ("^Paradiso~ XII," in ^Dante's
"Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor
Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], p. 181): "... the
excellence of one wheel implies that of the other, and the chariot
would, of course, not be able to function without making equal and
simultaneous use of both."

Whatever the metaphor controlling this passage, whether biblical or
astronomical or mechanical, the simplest solution of the literal sense
of the line is to understand that line 144, "as a wheel that is moved
in just the same way," is attached to the preceding (Latin) noun,
^velle~.  What the text then says is clear: "But already my desire was
moving in a circle (around God), as was my will, revolving in just the
same way."  This was precisely the understanding put forward by Torraca
(comm. to vv. 143-145) over one hundred years ago that Bruno Nardi
belittled (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e
Letteratura", 1944]), p. 349n.).  The protagonist/poet's soul has left
our solar system behind and is moving in a circle, not around our
earth, but, like the angelic orders, around God.  See Pertile's
concluding remarks on the last paradox in the poem: The pilgrim has
found his peace in continual movement.  It is not an accident that
Goethe admired this final scene and used it in developing the
conclusion of the second part of ^Faust~.

Strangely enough, Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna:
Longo, 2002], p. 319) treats the ending of the poem as a failure of
Dante's "imaginative and intellectual faculties."  Perhaps he should
have taken into account the context furnished by the last four verses
of the poem, which he for some reason does not include in the final
considerations of his study.

	|145.~  While the fact that the word ^stelle~ is the last word of each
canticle would seem to have been an early and lasting perception, John
of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 133-145) appears to have been the first
ever to have it.
For the possibility that Dante's ^stella~ reflects Ovid's ^astra~
(^Metam~. XV.876) and ^his~ starry vision of his own personal
immortality that concludes his great poem (vv. 871-879), reformulated
by Dante to accord with quite a different (and less self-absorbed)
view, see Jessica Levenstein ("The Re-Formation of Marsyas in
^Paradiso~ I," in ^Dante for the New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda
Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New York: Fordham University Press,
2003], p. 418).

For an essay on this "last word," see John Ahern ("Dante's Last Word:
The ^Comedy~ as a ^liber coelestis~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]:
1-14), who, while not referring to Ovid, argues that this canto couches
its central concerns, conflating two metaphors, in the images of the
heavens as book and of the stars as alphabet.

Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) points out that the presence of the
same form of the verb ^muovere~ in the first and last lines of the
^cantica~ creates a sort of ring composition.  He also points out that
Dante's practice in this regard resembles that found in ^canzoni~ of
other poets in his time; he also suggests the pertinence of the ending
(which happens to constitute its thirty-third paragraph) of the
^Epistle to Cangrande~ (XIII.90): "And since, when the Beginning or
First, which is God, has been reached, there is nought to be sought for
beyond, inasmuch as He is Alpha and Omega, that is, the Beginning and
the End, as the ^Vision~ of John tells us, the work ends in God
Himself, who is blessed for evermore, world without end" (tr. P.
Toynbee).
