	|1-3.~  For the resemblance of Dante's ^candida rosa~ to the rose-wheel
windows of medieval cathedrals, see John Leyerle ("The Rose-Wheel
Design and Dante's ^Paradiso~," ^University of Toronto Quarterly~ 46
[1977]: 280-308).  He argues for the double significance of this
design: the wheel of Fortune, symbol of the fleetingness of earthly
success, and the rose, symbol of a higher and more ordered affection
(one particularly related to the Blessed Virgin).  He then goes on to
suggest that Dante has this design in mind both in his depiction of
Fortune's wheel (^Inf~. VII) and of the Rose found here in the
Empyrean.  Leyerle also believes that a particular rose-wheel window
was in Dante's mind, the one that was completed in the fa$cade of the
basilica of S. Zeno in Verona at least by 1300.  On the exterior of S.
Zeno, carvings of human figures, all four of whom are either falling or
rising, strengthen his first case; the lovely tracing of the light on
the inner spaces of the cathedral are at least not unlike the design
found in Dante's Rose.  However, see John Scott ("Canto XXXI," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 477), citing John
Barnes ("^Ut architectura poesis?~ The Case of Dante's ^candida rosa~,"
^The Italianist~ 6 [1986], pp. 25 and 31, n. 30) for the argument that
the term for "rose window" only begins to appear in the European
vernaculars, first in France, in the very late seventeenth century.
This is hardly conclusive evidence that Dante did not think of one of
these round, large, beautiful, and many-hued glass structures, piercing
stone and splashing the interior space with colored light, as the model
for his Rose.  (In fact, Rosetta Migliorini-Fissi's ^lectura~ of the
canto ["Canto XXXI," in ^"Paradiso": Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~, dir.
P. Giannantonio {Naples: Loffredo, 2000 [1989]}, pp. 609-11] certainly
lends credence to Leyerle's argument; while she does not mention his
article, but does note two later treatments, found in Giuseppe Di
Scipio's fifth chapter [^The Symbolic Rose in Dante's "Paradiso"~
{Ravenna: Longo, 1984}] and in John Demaray [^Dante and the Book of the
Cosmos~ {Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1987}], she
points out that the idea was first broached in 1870 by Ozanam.)  The
term may be anachronistic, but nothing in Leyerle's case depends upon
the availability of the term.  And if one were to select a particular
window, Leyerle has chosen well.  Verona was, at least for two lengthy
periods in both decades of the fourteenth century in which Dante lived,
the focal point of his life as an exile, at least until his removal to
Ravenna probably in the final third of the second decade.  San Zeno was
(and is) an astoundingly beautiful church.  In an unpublished article
written ca. 1980, Hollander, in passing, raised the possibility that
the head of a hound in the central panel of the left portal of the
bronze doors of San Zeno, which he photographed in April 1975, might
have served as instigation (or confirmation) of the prophecy of the
Veltro on Dante's first visit to that city soon after he arrived there
early in his exile.

	|1.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-3) sees that the adverb ^dunque~ (then)
is pointing to a previous discussion (Beatrice's first description of
the Rose, in ^Par~. XXX.124-132, "interrupted" by the "digression" [at
XXX.133-145] of her bitter words about Henry's death and the corrupt
recent popes Boniface and Clement).  With "dunque" the poet announces
his return to her prior subject.  The word's casual,
"vernacular-sounding" nature caught the attention of Aldo Scaglione
("Periodic Syntax and Flexible Meter in the ^Divina Commedia~,"
^Romance Philology~ 21 [1967]: 1-22), as is reported by John Scott
("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 476).
Both of them refer to the term brought to bear in Dante studies by
Erich Auerbach ("^Sermo humilis~," in ^Literary Language and Its Public
in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages~, tr. R. Manheim
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965 {1958}], pp. 25-66),
^sermo humilis~, for the low style, in their classification of this
linguistic gesture.  Scott admires the juxtaposition of ^dunque~ with
^candida rosa~ (luminous white rose) as the expression of Dante's union
of the low with the sublime.

Vellutello (comm. to vv. 1-3) was apparently the first commentator, in
a long tradition, to link the "bianche stole" (white robes) last heard
of in ^Paradiso~ XXX.129 with the adjective ^candida~ (luminous white)
modifying ^rosa~.  Grandgent (comm. to this verse) is one of only two
in the DDP to suggest a source in Albertus Magnus (^De laudibus beatae
Mariae Virginis~ [XII.iv.33]): "Et nota, quod Christus rosa, Maria
rosa, Ecclesia rosa, fidelis anima rosa," equating Jesus, Mary, the
Church, and the faithful soul of a believer with the rose.

For the fullest bibliography for this canto available in print, see
Gustavo Costa ("Il canto XXXI del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996],
pp. 78-85).

	|2-3.~  The protagonist gazes at the ^milizia~ (soldiery) that fought
on for the Church that Christ "adquisivit sanguine suo" (obtained with
His own blood -- Acts 20:28, first cited by Tommaseo [comm. to vv.
1-3]).  And see the note to verse 127.  Dante never stops seeing the
Church as an army, even in its peaceful triumph.

	|4-6.~  The other host, the angels, now take the poet's attention,
flying up to the "hive" while contemplating and singing Its glory.

	|5.~  The first five words of ^Paradiso~ I.1 are present here, verbatim.

	|7-12.~  The angelic host is given similetic expression.  At first, by
Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 7-9) and Benvenuto (comm. to vv.
4-12), these bees were seen as deriving from ^Aeneid~ I.430-431.
However, from Vellutello (comm. to vv. 4-12) onward, commentators have
heard the more relevant echo of the simile at ^Aeneid~ VI.703-709 (for
that text, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXX.64-66).

The conclusion of Albert Rossi's study ("The Poetics of Resurrection:
Virgil's Bees [^Paradiso~ XXXI, 1-12]," ^Romanic Review~ 80 [1989], pp.
313-24) accounts for the disparities in the two similes by showing that
the situation in the ^Aeneid~, from a Christian perspective, is less
propitious than it first may seem.  As a central case in point, Aeneas
discovers that all these happy shades are about to be (from Dante's
perspective) "reincarnated."  We can hardly imagine the joy felt by the
hero of this "epic" when he sees the souls in the Rose as they will
look when they are resurrected.  Surely we are meant to remember
Aeneas's quite different reaction, when he learns from Anchises about
the flesh that these souls in the Elysian Fields will bear with them as
they return to the world and its toils.  Indeed, Aeneas laments their
return to the world of flesh (^Aen~. VI.719-721).  In the post-Platonic
^Aeneid~, the world of flesh has nothing to do with spiritual
perfection; in Dante's poem the beatified spirit has only a single
unfulfilled desire: to be granted the return of its flesh.  Thus, if
Dante allows Virgilian text a renewed presence in his poem, he is not
without the ironic distance that we have found present in even the
first moments of the poem (for example, see the notes to ^Inf~. II.28
and II.56-57).

For other possible sources for this passage, e.g., in St. Anselm and
St. Bernard, see Scott ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 478).  For several different passages in Bernard, see
the following: Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-12), Torraca (comm. to these
verses), Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 7), and Trucchi (comm. to vv.
4-12), who also cites Anselm.  A few later commentators also make
gestures in both these directions, if without furnishing texts.

A discussion of the elaborate structural play in this simile is found
in Richard Lansing (^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in
Dante's "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1977], p. 37).  The vehicle and
tenor of the simile each mirrors both moments in the movement of the
bees/angels, first down to the flowers/souls, then back up to the
hive/God.

	|7.~  As we have seen (note to ^Par~. XXX.64-66), Virgil's verb
^(insidere)~ for what the bees do at least suggests that, more than
settling on the blossoms, they enter them.  Thus Dante here follows
Virgil faithfully, if others seem to believe he does not (see
Bosco/Reggio [comm. to this verse]).

	|9.~  The word ^laboro~ is obviously a deliberate Latinism, since
^lavoro~, Italian for "labor," is metrically the same, and Dante's hand
was not forced by rhyme.  Why does he choose this linguistic tactic
here?  Perhaps to underline his borrowing from Virgil.

	|12.~  We are given a clue as to the separate "dwelling" of God.
According to Fallani (comm. to vv. 40-42), among the Scholastics there
was a tradition of a second "heaven" in the Empyrean, the ^coelum
Trinitatis~ (the heaven of the Trinity), a "place" distinct from the
Empyrean, where dwelt the triune God, separated from the blessed souls.
 In Fallani's opinion, Dante accepts that tradition.  It is, however,
not clear that he does.  Perhaps he both honors and abrogates it, for
his God is not in an "eleventh zone" of the heavens, but in the one He
shares with the saints - if in a higher and thus different ^locus~ from
them (the distance between the "floor" and the top tier of the Rose is
greater than that between the lowest place in the sea and the highest
place beneath the Moon [see the note to vv. 73-78]; the distance
between that point in the Rose and God would seem to be infinite).  And
thus Dante can have things both ways: Is God separate from the saints?
Yes and no.  He is infinitely higher up than they, but that does not
require that He "inhabits" another "place," especially since His
"habitation" is everywhere and nowhere.  It seems clear that Dante
intends to avoid this issue.  For the presence of the phrase ^coelum
Trinitatis~, in a context that is related, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Super
Evangelium S. Matthaei lectura~ (51.2, referring to Psalm 36:11 [37:11]
and Matthew 5:5, "The meek shall inherit the earth"; Aquinas explains
that the ^terra~ [earth] promised them is the Empyrean).  It is not
entirely clear, but he seems to think of the Empyrean and the ^coelum
Trinitatis~ as though they might be considered one and the same.

	|13-15.~  Dante's description of the angels, flaming red faces, golden
wings, and white "bodies," is possibly based in biblical texts as well
as popular iconography (as found, for instance, painted on church
walls).  Quite a few biblical sources have been a part of the
indeterminate discussion down through the centuries.  Perhaps the only
sure citation (for the angels' red faces) is Scartazzini's (comm. to
verse 13): Ezechiel 1:13: "their appearance was like burning coals of
fire," which has quantitatively the most support.  A second at least
likely attribution is Tommaseo's (comm. to this tercet), who, for the
white, cites Matthew 28:3: the angel who appears at the tomb of Jesus,
his vestments "white as snow" (some later commentators join [or
substitute] Matthew's supposed "source," Daniel 7:9).  The gold has
several suggestions based in Daniel 10:5, but this is not convincingly
chosen, since the gold there described is that found on a belt, not on
wings.

As for the "allegorical" meaning of the three colors, nearly all can
agree that the red faces bespeak angelic love.  However, the other two
are the cause of disagreement.  Some, unconvincingly, propose the
Trinity (Love, Wisdom [?], and Power [??]); others select various
abstractions, not much more convincingly.  There is a general
understanding that the angels and their colors are perfect in three
respects: they love perfectly, fly on immortal pinions, and have
"bodies" that are utterly pure.  And that is probably enough.

	|17-18.~  In Dante's lovely transposition, these bees, now having
gathered the "pollen" (God's love) from the hive, bring "honey" ^back~
from the hive to the souls: a celestial variant on nature's apiary
artistry.  These flowers have a second chance to enjoy their own (now
enhanced) sweetness.  Dante's "honey," like God's love and their love
for Him, is bidirectional.

As Augustine knew and taught, mortal love can never satisfy or be
satisfied: "inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te" (restless
is our heart until it find rest in you -- ^Confessiones~ I.1).  These
two words, ^pace~ and ^ardore~ ("peace" and "love"), can be found
together only here in the Empyrean, never in Dante's world below.

	|19-27.~  The numberless host of the angels, circling God in nine ranks
(see the note to ^Par~. XXVIII.25-27), do not hinder in any way either
His ray from reaching the saints in the Rose or their ability to make
out His splendor (which Aversano [^Dante daccapo~ {glosses to the
^Paradiso~}, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001], p. 159) particularizes as the Second Person, Christ, irradiated
by the Father).  Torraca (comm. to vv. 22-24) reminds us that, in
^Convivio~ (III.vii.5), Dante had in fact said that the angels were as
though translucent ^(diafani)~.  Indeed, all of them, those who
believed in Christ to come and those who believed after the fact, are
gazing lovingly on the triune God.

	|22-23.~  See ^Paradiso~ I.2 and the note to verse 5, above.  Thus
Dante, nearing his ending, reflects his beginning, a way of also
signaling that the poem is approaching its conclusion.

	|25-27.~  We now see all the saints doing what, as we will learn in the
next canto, they always do, looking up, fixing their gaze on God.
There is no variety in Heaven, nor is it desired by the blessed.

We also learn, in that canto, what is intrinsic only to what we see
here.  There are more Jews in Heaven than Christians.  This puzzled
some commentators and infuriated others, the first group claiming that
Dante could not possibly have meant this, the others believing him only
too well.  Pretty clearly Dante's neat division of the Rose into two
equal parts, with a few empty seats in the Christian half and none in
the Jewish one, is meant to force that conclusion upon a reader.  As
far as we know, there are only a very few gentiles among the Hebrew
group.  In fact, we know only that there are two, Cato (there thus
^should be~ at least one empty place in the full half, as Cato is still
minding Purgatory) and Ripheus (Statius and Trajan were both alive in
Christian times).  Dante's point is clear: More Jews believed in Christ
without the authority of His presence, as certified by the witness
provided by the New Testament, than did Christians, even though they
were given the answers before they took the exam.

	|28-29.~  In verse 27 the saints are said to aim their gaze at a single
target.  Now the poet speaks of that single essence as a "star," but
also as the Trinity, a "threefold Light," bringing joy to all the
blessed who behold it (and they all do).  Some of the early
commentators are less clear than they might be that this is not an
"invocation" or part of the prayer that Dante will address to God in
verse 30.  This is an example of apostrophe, one of praise, and not
part of a request.

	|30.~  The poet then addresses God, praying that He look down at the
"storm" afflicting mortal lives on earth.  Is there an implicit further
request to be understood here?  Most of the commentators think so.  And
all of them who are of this opinion believe that Dante is asking God to
intervene on behalf of storm-tossed mortals.  However, it seems at
least as likely that he means no such thing.  Rather, as the reference
to Florence (verse 39) might also suggest, God ought to look down at
the spectacle of human sin with grim recognition of the lostness of
those living now on earth, almost all of them beyond redemption.
Apparently the first to offer so point-blank a negative reading was
Francesco Roffar@e ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 1107).
What stands in the way of accepting this pessimistic interpretation is
the highly possible presence of a citation of a passage, first cited by
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 28-30), in Boethius's ^Consolatio~ (I.m5.42-48):
"O God, whoever you are, who joins [^sic~] all things in perfect
harmony, look down upon this miserable earth!  We men are no small part
of Your great work, yet we wallow here in the stormy sea of fortune.
Ruler of all things, calm the roiling waves and, as You rule the
immense heavens, rule also the earth in stable concord" (tr. R. Green).
 Also germane is ^Monarchia~ I.xvi.4, first cited by Torraca (comm. to
vv. 28-30): "O human race, how many storms and misfortunes and
shipwrecks must toss you about while, transformed into a many-headed
beast, you strive after conflicting things" (tr. P. Shaw).  This last
is part of the bitter conclusion of the first book of that treatise,
and would not encourage one to believe that, if Dante were thinking of
it here, he foresaw any sort of divine aid coming to the human race.
On the other hand, see the prophecy concluding ^Paradiso~ XXVII, which
does predict God's positive intervention in the affairs of men
(similarly presented as a storm at sea [^fortuna~] -- see the note to
^Par~. XXVII.142-148).  It is thus difficult to decide what the author
intended us to gather about the nature of his request for God's
attention.

For the possible presence of a citation here of ^Aeneid~ II.689-690,
see Daniello (comm. to vv. 29-30).

	|31-40.~  In this lengthy simile the poet compares barbarians, probably
coming, in times of peace, from Northern Europe to Rome, seeing the
imperial buildings of the city before Constantine gave those buildings
to the papacy just after his conversion in 312, to himself, moving in
the opposite direction, "south" to "north," from Florence to the New
Jerusalem above the heavens.  The magnificent church of St. John
Lateran was destroyed by fire in 1308.  Making things worse, Henry VII,
denied a coronation in St. Peter's by Pope Clement, was crowned in the
ruins of that church in 1312, nearly exactly one thousand years later,
and died the next year (see the note to ^Par~. XVII.82-84).

For a discussion of the various notions of what exactly Dante meant by
the reference, see Gustavo Costa ("Il canto XXXI del ^Paradiso~,"
^L'Alighieri~ 8 [1996], pp. 65-66).

	|32-33.~  Callisto was exiled by Diana from the "nunnery" of chaste
forest maidens for her affair with Jove, which resulted in her giving
birth to Arcas.  "The 'zone' that is always 'covered by Helice' is the
North.  The nymph Helice or Callisto was transformed into the
constellation of the Great Bear, and her son Arcas or Bo,otes into the
Little Bear: ^Metam.~ II.496-530, especially 515-517; cf. ^Purg.~
XXV.131.  The Bears, or Dippers, are close to the North Star"
(Grandgent, comm. to vv. 31-34).

	|37-39.~  The phrase "a people just and sane" is the third and last in
a series of parallel pairs, with the parallelism inverted in the third
term: good/bad, good/bad, bad/good.  See ^Paradiso~ XVI.152, where
Florentines in "the good old days" were portrayed in much more positive
terms.  Now things have changed, and Florentines are those left behind
in order for Dante to associate with such people as they once were, now
found only in Heaven.

	|39.~  This is the fifteenth and last time we hear the word ^Fiorenza~
in the poem; we first heard it in Farinata's voice (^Inf~. X.92).
While in fact Florence had replaced Rome as the greatest city of Italy,
Dante here reverses that equation, making old Rome the type of the
celestial city, while new Florence is portrayed as the city of the lost.

	|43-48.~  The second simile in a series of three dedicated to the theme
of pilgrimage (see the note to vv. 103-111), this one presents Dante as
a traveler to a shrine, a journey that he has vowed to make.  For the
pilgrimage motif in the entire poem, see Julia Bolton Holloway (^The
Pilgrim and the Book~ [New York: Peter Lang, 1992]).

While Dante leaves the particular shrine he may have had in mind
shrouded in silence, the early commentators variously suggested the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, St. Peter's in Rome, and St.
James of Compostella in Galicia (Spain), the three most important
destinations for pilgrims in his day.

	|48.~  The Tuscan word for "now" ^(mo)~ was first heard at ^Inferno~
X.21 and leaves the poem after a dazzling three uses in a single line
(and the twenty-third through twenty-fifth in all), perhaps underlining
Dante's desire to be considered a vernacularizing poet even at the
sublime height of the Empyrean.  The effect of the triple presence of
the word accents the eager nature of his glance, unable to move quickly
enough in taking in every aspect of the place he has so long desired to
see, the goal of his pilgrimage.  Verse 54 describes Dante's similar
hurried and eager glances cast around the Rose in the attempt to take
it all in.

	|49-51.~  What the protagonist sees, faces, reminds us that it was only
the first few souls whom he saw in the heavens whose human features he
could make out (see the note to ^Par~. III.58-63).  Now he is seeing,
as Beatrice promised he would (in ^Par~. XXX.44-45), the souls as they
will look when they are reincarnate.

	|51.~  The word ^onestade~ has only two occurrences in the poem.  The
last time we heard it was in the poet's description of Virgil when he
was running up the slope of Mount Purgatory (^Purg~. III.11) after Cato
chastised the souls who listened, charmed, to Casella's song.  There
Virgil is seen as having lost his dignity; here the souls in the Rose
are seen by the protagonist as having theirs.

	|52-54.~  The mood is quiet, preparing us for a transition, moving from
the general to the specific.

	|55-58.~  Compare the similar scene in ^Purgatorio~ XXX.43-54, when the
protagonist turns back to speak to Virgil, only to find him gone.  This
scene, clearly reflective of that one, is much briefer and in an
altogether different key.  That one is three times as long, and in the
tragic mode.  Here, the disappearance of Beatrice has a quite different
tonality.  Among the differences is that she disappears from the "floor
of the arena" only to reappear in her place in the Rose (see ^Par~.
XXXI.71).

	|56-57.~  What were the questions Dante still wanted Beatrice to
answer?  Are we supposed to wonder?  Or is this mere "realistic detail"
(i.e., are we merely supposed to reflect, "Of course, anyone would have
a lot of questions during a first visit to Paradise")?  Some
commentators, however, try to ascertain what questions Dante wanted to
ask.  For example, Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 55-57): Dante wants
to know the identities of those seated in the Rose; or Benvenuto (comm.
to vv. 52-57): Dante wants to know where Mary and Beatrice are seated.
Poletto (comm. to vv. 52-57) loses patience with such attempts, urging
us not to seek what the poet has chosen not to reveal.  Francesco da
Buti (comm. to vv. 43-57) had solved the riddle acceptably, if
obviously and unprofitably: Dante had questions about Paradise....
Steiner (comm. to these verses) has the wisest response: These lines
refer to the questions that St. Bernard will eventually respond to,
reading them in God.  In fact, this is a rare occasion on which almost
everyone is essentially correct.  Bernard does answer Dante's voiced
question (Where is Beatrice? [verse 64]) and one unvoiced one (Where is
Mary? [verse 100]).  He also in the next canto names a good number of
souls seated in the Rose, as Jacopo suggested he might and as Bernard
says he will (vv. 97-99).

In a recent conversation, Simone Marchesi made the suggestion that
possibly this "comically resolved" scene is meant to remind us not only
of Dante's "tragic" loss of Virgil in this poem (see the note to vv.
100-102) but also of Aeneas's turning back to Creusa to speak further,
only to find her gone (^Aen~. II.790-794), a scene which itself looks
back to Orpheus's loss of Eurydice in the fourth ^Georgic~, which Dante
has borrowed to such striking effect in ^Purgatorio~ XXX.49-51.

	|58-60.~  In place of Beatrice, he finds, near him on the "floor" of
the Rose, an "old man" (it will turn out to be Bernard, but we do not
know that yet), looking like the other blessed souls.

	|59.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Par~. XXXII.40-75), who point out
that by portraying Bernard as an old man ^(sene),~ Dante is violating a
commonly understood ground rule of ^Paradiso~, that all souls are, in
their perfected beings, of the age of Christ in His last year on earth,
when he was thirty-three.  (This is sometimes given as thirty,
thirty-three, thirty-four, or even thirty-five.)  Why Dante chose to
violate this "rule" is not clear.  Bosco/Reggio opt for an artist's
rebellion against a view that would inhibit his artistic virtuosity, an
old Bernard being more believable than one in his renewed youth.  And
see Carroll (comm. to ^Par~. XXXII.1-48), discussing the babes seated
in the lower half of the Rose: "Further, as we saw in the case of
Bernard himself, Dante appears to ignore the doctrine of Aquinas that
in the Resurrection the saints will rise at the age of thirty.
Bernard, himself an old man, draws his attention to the child faces and
voices of the lower ranks [^Par.~ XXXII.46-48].  Each soul, apparently,
wears the form proper to the age it had attained on earth, freed of
course from weakness and defect of the flesh.  Dante evidently felt
that there would have been something incongruous in making babies, who
had never exercised true choice, appear full-grown in the flower of
life.  [Augustine thought otherwise: infants would receive 'by the
marvelous and rapid operation of God that body which time by a slower
process would have given them' (^De Civ. Dei~, XXII.14).]"  For a
counter-thrust, see Mario Aversano ("Sulla poetica dantesca nel canto
XXIV del ^Purgatorio~," ^L'Alighieri~ 16 [2000]: 167) on verse 46 of
the next canto.  He argues that in Dante's Empyrean we see only the
aspects worn by the saints as of "now," in the year 1300.  They will
"mature" (or grow younger, as the case may be) in their appearance only
after the General Resurrection, citing ^Inferno~ VI.103-111.  Are we
thus to believe that what Dante sees now is only temporary likenesses
of these souls?  Perhaps.  But surely Dante would have given us a clue
that this is what we should understand.  In any case, Aversano is
perhaps alone in this interpretation.

	|63.~  Bernard is Dante's last "father" in the poem.  For a listing,
see the note to ^Paradiso~ XVI.16.

	|64.~  See Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), reminding the reader of
the Magdalen's remark to the resurrected Jesus, whom she mistakes for a
"gardener," upon not seeing Jesus where she expects to see him, in his
sepulcher (John 20:15): "Si tu sustulisti ^eum~, dicito mihi ubi..."
(If you have carried him away, tell me where..." [italics added]).  The
only other commentator in the DDP to cite this passage, without, it
nearly goes without saying, citing his predecessor, is Poletto (comm.
to vv. 64-69).

These are Dante's first spoken words since ^Paradiso~ XXVIII.57.  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XIV.88-96 for notice of a considerably longer
silence on his part.

	|65-69.~  Bernard's first words answer Dante's most pressing concern,
the whereabouts of Beatrice, who, he points out, is in the third row
from the top.  For a similar scene, see ^Inferno~ II.109-112, where
Beatrice tells how Lucy came to her exactly where we see her now and
got her to leave this seat in order to go into Limbo to enlist Virgil's
aid.  Just so has she now enlisted Bernard's help on Dante's behalf and
then reassumed her place.

	|70-72.~  Dante sees Beatrice literally in glory, resplendent with the
light of God.

	|71.~  For Beatrice's crown and Aquinas's discussion of the additional
^aureola~ accorded especially favored saints, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXIII.95 and Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 71-72).

	|73-78.~  From the highest point in the earth's sublunar atmosphere to
the deepest seabed was not so far as Dante found himself now from
Beatrice; and yet he could see her as though there were no appreciable
distance between them.  The poet has already explained (^Par~.
XXX.121-123) that in the Empyrean, the usual physical laws that we know
on earth are suspended.

In a sense, Dante here "disinvents" the as-yet-to-be-discovered
technique of perspectival representation that would distinguish Italian
painting of the next century.

	|77.~  See John Scott ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 485) for this striking word ^(effige)~, which is used
only here and in ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.131, thus further associating
Beatrice and Christ.  No commentator in the DDP looks up from his text
to make that observation.

	|79-90.~  Apparently, the first commentator to pay any conscious
attention to the protagonist's switch from the honorific ^voi~, in
addressing Beatrice, to the affectionate ^tu~, was Grabher (comm. to
vv. 70-93), if he does not make much out of it.  Porena (comm. to vv.
79-90) also notices the change, but has quite a strong sense of what it
signifies, only appearing to be a closing of the distance between them,
but being in fact a distancing, because it is the ^tu~ addressed to a
saint, or that is proffered both to God and to Mary.  Indeed, both God
and Mary, in Christian theology, have the unique gift of being divine
and human simultaneously - as does Beatrice.  Nonetheless, Chimenz
(comm. to vv. 79-84) admires Porena's formulation.  Giacalone (comm. to
vv. 79-84) is also in their camp.  A different view is advanced by
Singleton (comm. to verse 80), one that proposes that the guide has
become the individual soul of Beatrice (Singleton retains his sense
that the guide is "allegorical," while the individual is not, a
judgment that some would dispute in its first instance, others in the
second).  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 82-84) also support Porena's
thesis.

For a different view, see Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New
Haven: Yale University Press,
2001], pp. 126-27), pointing out that, as in the ^Vita nuova~, Beatrice
in Heaven may indeed be addressed with ^tu~, "only when she is at one
with God, where and when there are no human hierarchies."  The fact
would seem to be that these eleven second-person-singular pronouns and
verb endings (in only twelve verses) do indicate a more personal sense
of affection, in a sort of uncontrolled outburst of personal
enthusiasm, allowable now that they are on an equal footing as lovers
of one another in God.  We cannot imagine Jesus addressing Mary as
^Voi~.

	|79-81.~  For the figural equation, Beatrice as Dante's "Christ," see
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969]), p. 261.  After calling attention to the
poet's last words to Virgil in the poem (^Purg~. XXX.51), "Virgilio a
cui per mia salute die'mi" (Virgil, to whom I gave myself for my
salvation), he then continues as follows, discussing this tercet: "At
Dante's beginnings we do well to have in mind his endings, and vice
versa.  It is Beatrice, the figure of Christ, who brings Dante to
salvation; it is Virgil who brings Dante to Beatrice.  Dante does not
(and did not in the ^Vita nuova~) use the word ^salute~ lightly.  His
last words to Virgil give him the highest function anyone less than
Christ can perform, and that is to bring another to Christ."  In this
vein, see John A. Scott ("Dante's Allegory," ^Romance Philology~ 26
[1973]: 570).  See also Amilcare Iannucci ("^Paradiso~ XXXI," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], p. 483 - citing his
earlier article ["Beatrice in Limbo: a Metaphoric Harrowing of Hell,"
^Dante Studies~ 97 {1979}: 23-45]), who also notes Beatrice's
Christlike attributes in this passage (as, once again, does Scott
["Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone {Florence: Cesati, 2002}], p. 486).
This has become more or less the standard interpretation of those
considered by some in Italy to be part of a so-called ^scuola
americana~, "the American school (of Dante studies)."  And see Emilio
Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~
[Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], p. 254), remarking on the
"near-heterodoxy" of these verses.

To be honest, this reading seems so obvious that one feels apologetic
for harping on it.  However, to understand what blinders Dantists
accustomed themselves to wearing whenever they came near the border of
so "blasphemous" a theologized poetic for the poem, see the
allegorizing glosses of such as Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to this
tercet).  In his reading (and he is far from being alone in it),
Beatrice becomes "theology" who comes down to this "hell on earth" (our
world, not Limbo) in order to bring her message to all mortals
(including, we assume, Dante Alighieri).  This is so flagrantly
wrongheaded that one has to admire Benvenuto at least for his
stubbornness in not yielding to a Christological interpretation of
Beatrice nor to a personal one of Dante, who, in his treatment, is only
a stand-in for all humankind.  This, one of the most personal moments
of the ^Commedia~, is thus turned into a kind of simpleminded version
of an uplifting moral tale, one only implausibly attributed to the
genius of Dante.  Reviewing responses to this passage in the DDP, one
finds the word "Christ" only in Singleton's commentary (to verse 91) of
1975.  How did (or does) anyone read this passage and ^not~ think of
Christ's descent into Hell and His subsequent harrowing of the Hebrew
saints?  However, not even Giacalone, the first commentator who
presents himself as a follower of the figural interpretation sponsored
first by Auerbach (cited by him in 56 glosses) and then by Singleton
(cited in 25), responds as one might have expected he would to this
provocation.  It is surely more shocking that Singleton, who only
mentions Auerbach once in his commentary, not even on that occasion
(his gloss to ^Purg~. XII.40-42) refers to Auerbach's discussions of
Dante's figural technique (something Singleton never did in any of his
publications; see Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ {New Haven: Yale
University Press, 2001}, p. 38]).  Talk about Harold Bloom's "anxiety
of influence"!

	|85.~  The typological equations (Beatrice = Moses; Dante = the
Hebrews) once again align Beatrice with Christ.  See the note to verses
79-81.  Here, as there, the commentators seem to want to avoid such
"blasphemous" associations.  For the Exodus as the poem's controlling
trope, see Singleton ("'In exitu Israel de Aegypto,'" ^Annual Report of
the Dante Society~ 78 [1960]: 1-24).

	|88-90.~  As one who had sinned against Beatrice once before, Dante
knows whereof he speaks.  He thus prays that she will help him remain
pure of soul for the rest of his time on earth when he is again without
her.  When he wrote these lines, he probably did not realize how brief
that time would be.

	|91-93.~  This is the final tercet devoted to the interaction of the
two lovers in the poem.  Her final smile yields to her returning her
attention to the source of all being.

	|94-99.~  Bernard summarizes the tasks that lie ahead for Dante: He
must contemplate this resplendent gathering ^(splendore)~ to prepare
himself to see, up through the ray ^(raggio)~, the source of the
irradiating light ^(luce)~.  See the note on Dante's physics of light,
^Paradiso~ XXIII.82-84.

	|94.~  Dante uses the Latinism ^sene~ (from ^senex~) again.  See the
note to verse 59. The word had appeared, in a Latin form, once before, in
^Purg.~ XXX.17.

	|96.~  A disputed verse.  Some believe the prayer is Beatrice's, the
love Bernard's; others think that both are Beatrice's.  See Scartazzini
(comm. to this verse) for a summary of the two positions and a strong
vote for the first solution, but eventual openness to the second.

	|97-99.~  Bernard's suggestion might indicate that one of Dante's
unasked questions (see the note to vv. 56-57) had to do with the
population of the Rose.

	|102.~  Bernard names himself, having sounded like a lyric poet of
Dante's youthful acquaintance talking about his lady, associating
himself, however, not with a Giovanna, a Lagia, or a Selvaggia, but
with the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Everything about this moment comes as a
surprise.  We did not anticipate a new guide in the poem, if Dante
surely decided that he wanted to have a chance to bid farewell to
Beatrice, as well as to present her as being back in bliss.  In
addition, perhaps for reasons reflecting his personal devotion (for a
possible confirmation, see ^Par~. XXIII.88-89), he wanted a guide more
associated with Mary for this highest part of the poem (not that
Beatrice would have been in any way unqualified); perhaps he also felt
a numerological tug in deciding to have a trinitarian third instructor.
 Still, one sympathizes with those who feel that there is something
ungainly about the substitution of Bernard for Beatrice.  (See the
discussion in Steven Botterill [^Dante and the Mystical Tradition:
Bernard of Clairvaux in the "Commedia"~ {Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1994}], pp. 64-115.)   And no one who defends the
advent of a new guide can argue that it has been at all prepared for,
as was Beatrice's (as early as ^Inf~. I.121-126).  Lino Pertile ("Quale
amore va in Paradiso?" in ^"Le donne, i cavalieri, l'arme, gli amori":
Poema e romanzo: la narrativa lunga in Italia~, ed. Francesco Bruni
[Venice: Marsilio, 2001]), pp. 67-69) goes so far as to argue, if not
particularly convincingly, that Dante had planned (and the first sign
of such a plan revealed itself, according to him, in ^Inf~. II.24-25,
with the indication of Mary, Lucy, and Beatrice) to have Beatrice
replaced by Lucy.  Whatever one thinks of that solution, one must admit
that there is a problem here, one that a few strokes of the quill could
have avoided.  However, see Francesco Mazzoni ("San Bernardo e la
visione poetica della ^Divina Commedia~," in ^Seminario Dantesco
Internazionale: Atti del primo convegno tenutosi al Chauncey Conference
Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z.G. Baranski [Florence: Le
Lettere, 1997], pp. 171-241), who insists on the influence of Bernard's
work (or that which Dante considered Bernardine) behind the text of the
poem from its outset.  And see Amilcare Iannucci ("^Paradiso~ XXXI," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 481-82), for the
notion that the surprise of Bernard's presence is only a tactic to
alert us to his importance for Dante.  A series of essays discussing
the reflection of several of Bernard's writings in the ^Commedia~ is
found in Mario Aversano (^San Bernardo e Dante.  Teologia e poesia
della conversione~ [Salerno: Edisud, 1990]).  For a summary of
Bernard's importance for Dante and of the presence of his writing
behind the cantos in which he appears, see Carroll (comm. to vv.
118-142).

For the possible influence of Bernard's ^De diligendo Deo~ on the
structure of the entire poem, see Hollander ("The Invocations of the
^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of Italian Studies~ 3 [1976]: 235-40, repr. in
^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], pp. 33-38).  And see the
notes to ^Purgatorio~ XXVII.139-141 and ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.127-132.  For
a compact treatment of Bernard's life, see Raoul Manselli, "Bernardo di
Chiaravalle, santo," ^ED~ (I [1970]), pp. 601a-5b, which, however,
skirts the question of the actual literary influence of Bernard on
Dante.  For an introductory treatment in English, one may, in addition
to Botterill, consult E.G. Gardner (^Dante and the Mystics~ [London:
Dent, 1913], pp. 111-43).

Dante does not refer to Bernard's urgent and frequent support of the
Second Crusade (1145-1147) in his preaching.  For a study of this
crusade, inevitably linked to the adjective "disastrous," see Giles
Constable ("The Second Crusade as Seen by Contemporaries," ^Traditio~ 9
[1953]: 213-279).  Dante's silence is perhaps not surprising, given its
failure.

Bernard names himself only at the end of his speech (vv. 94-102).  The
impression of humility is perhaps less pronounced than when similar
behavior was exhibited by both Thomas Aquinas (^Par~. X.82-99) and
Cacciaguida (^Par~. XV.88-135), who indeed speak longer before naming
themselves.  Nonetheless, his comportment is clearly intended to
portray his modesty.

	|103-111.~  This long but essentially simple simile links Dante once
again with a pilgrim arriving at his destination, in this case Rome,
where the Veronica, a most holy relic, was preserved.  Veronica was
supposedly a woman of Jerusalem who offered Jesus a cloth ^(sudarium)~
to wipe the blood and sweat from His face on the way to Calvary.  His
features remained on the cloth, which was eventually taken to St.
Peter's in Rome, where it was displayed to the faithful on certain
occasions.  That her name was actually Veronica is doubtful, since her
name itself means "true likeness" ^(vera icona)~.  The whole history of
this image (and of other relics like it, particularly the Shroud of
Turin) is controversial.  But for Dante, there was not even a question
of its authenticity.  See his earlier reference, at the climactic
moment of the ^Vita nuova~ (XL.1), to pilgrims on their way to Rome to
see the Veronica, a moment fulfilled here in this poem by Dante's
pilgrimage to "that Rome where Christ Himself is Roman" (^Purg~.
XXXII.102).  For a discussion of both these moments, see Alessandro
Vettori ("Veronica: Dante's Pilgrimage from Image to Vision," ^Dante
Studies~ 121 [2003 {2006}]: 43-65).

See Richard Lansing (^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in
Dante's "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1977]), pp. 137-40) for
consideration of three consecutive similes in this canto (see also vv.
31-40 and 43-48) dedicated to the theme of completion of a pilgrimage.

	|103.~  Croatia, for Dante's audience, represented a very distant and
"foreign" place, as in the more recent expression "from here to
Timbuktu."

	|109-111.~  See Singleton (comm. on these verses): "Bernard's two
principal qualifications to serve as final guide in the journey stem
from his special devotion to the Virgin Mary and from his fame as one
dedicated to mystical contemplation with special emphasis on the
affective movement of the mind as it rises to God, an emphasis which
later Franciscan thought and devotion adopted and stressed.  It was
believed that Bernard, in such meditation, had a foretaste of the peace
of Heaven.  In the ^Meditationes piissimae~ (XIV, 36-37), ascribed to
Bernard, there is a rhapsody on the joys of contemplation.  See also
Bernard, ^Sermones in Cantica Canticorum~, XXIII, 15-16.  As noted
above, Dante in his ^Letter to Can Grande~ (^Epist.~ XIII, 80) refers
the reader of his ^Paradiso~ to Bernard's work ^De contemplatione~."

	|112-117.~  Dante, in fixing his gaze on Bernard, who has descended
from his seat in the Rose upon Beatrice's urging (see verse 66), has
fixated on a lesser version of the good and true than that which
Bernard will eventually bring him to see.  At least for now the Virgin
is the best sight available to him, and she is at the very highest
point, in the top row of the stadium-rose.

	|115-117.~  How many souls are seated in the Rose?  Dante keeps his
counsel on that question.  The Apocalypse numbers the saved as 144,000
(Apoc. 7:1, 7:4; 14:1, 14:3).  Landino (comm. to ^Par~. XXX.133-138)
reports that some say that the number of blessed is equivalent to the
number of fallen angels, while others are of the opinion that it is the
same as that of the remaining good angels.  (For Dante's previous
opinion on a related matter, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXIX.50.)
Landino concludes that only God knows the number of angels, as Aquinas
says.

	|118-142.~  This passage is seamless, describing a single action,
Dante's raising his eyes (verse 118) at Bernard's command and seeing
Mary, surrounded by angels and admired by the rest of the blessed.  It
is like a painting of the Virgin seated in glory.  However, since it is
only ^like~ a painting, the poet introduces his central scene with a
double simile, each element of which begins "e come."

Until now, we have been shown the Empyrean with a long-range
perspective, seeing all the Rose as a unit divided into many parts.
Now we focus on a single part of it and are presented with a new sense
of graduated selectivity, in which the things that are nearest Mary are
brightest, while those farthest from her gradually fade from view.

	|118-123.~  The first simile pairs Mary with the brightness of the Sun
at its rising, as compared with the entire rim of the sky.  We are
asked to imagine a 360+o~ view: The east and the parts of the horizon
nearest it are brightest, the west, where the Sun lit up the horizon
the evening before, the darkest.  As we will see, this arrangement is
perfectly mirrored in the varying brightness of parts of the Rose.

	|124-129.~  In the second simile, the brightness at the ^locus~ of the
rising Sun is contrasted with the diminished light on either side of
it, and is compared either to all the Rose or to Mary (see the note to
verse 127).

Once again, as in the first of these conjoined similes (vv. 118-123),
the varied lightness in parts of the Rose is insisted on.

	|124.~  Rhyme forces Dante into synecdoche, the part ^temo~ (yoke-beam,
or chariot pole [i.e., that to which the horses are attached]) for the
whole (chariot).  For other occurrences of this word (^timone~ in
modern Italian), see ^Purgatorio~ XXII.119; XXXII.49, 140, 144;
^Paradiso~ XIII.9.

	|125.~  We last heard of Phaeton, a frequent presence in the poem, in
^Paradiso~ XVII.3 (see the note to XVII.1-6).  Why Dante wants to
recall that tragic adventure here is not immediately evident.

	|127.~  This arresting oxymoron, "peaceful oriflamme" (or "battle flag
of peace"), has a varied history in the commentaries.  Most trace its
origin to the French royal battle standard.  John Scott ("Canto XXXI,"
in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 488) points out that,
whereas many contemporary commentators say that this banner of the
French kings, maintained at St. Denis, was red, it was actually red and
gold, as its Latin derivation makes plain (^auri fiamma~ [golden
flame]).  Earlier notice of this begins perhaps with Benvenuto (comm.
to vv. 124-129): "Maria flamma ignis aeterni et aurea" (Mary, a golden
tongue of eternal fire).  Venturi (comm. to this verse) seems to have
been the first to identify the French provenance of the banner and the
view that whoever fought beneath it was unconquerable.  A French
tradition claimed that the banner was first brought to the son of the
Christian emperor Constantine by an angel.  Andreoli (comm. to this
verse) refines the source of the tale a bit, referring to a version
indicating that Charlemagne fought under it.  The most complex
discussion of the various possibilities is found in Scartazzini (comm.
to this verse).  See Oelsner's brief exposition (comm. to this verse),
which, however, reverses the more usual relations between the red and
the gold: "The Oriflamme (^aurea flamma~) was the standard given by the
Angel Gabriel to the ancient kings of France, representing a [red]
flame on a golden ground.  No one who fought under it could be
conquered.  The golden glow of heaven is the invincible ensign not of
war but peace."

Most who write about this verse play up the opposed values of the two
elements in this image, Mary's peaceful conquest as opposed to the
French (or any) king's military exploits.  However, we should remember
that this gathering, too, is an army, if now a triumphant one, with all
but a final battle (that of the returning Christ against Antichrist at
the end of days) behind it.  (For a view in absolute disagreement with
this one, see Porena [comm. to this verse].)  While there is some
dispute about whether the ^oriafiamma~ is Mary alone, all the Rose
(including her), or some portion of the blessed souls distinct from
her, see Trucchi (comm. to vv. 124-129) for an interesting solution.
The ^oriafiamma~ is the entire Rose, Mary is the golden flame, the rest
of the blessed (the petals of the "rose") the red background.  While
this is not in accord with the minority explanation of what is figure,
what background, it surely is worth serious consideration  for its
complete explanation of all the elements in the image.  However, it is
clear that Mary is the light referred to as the Sun in both similes.
She is at the center ^(nel mezzo)~ of things as the protagonist now
sees them.

For a study of the resonance of martial epic in the poem, particularly
in ^Paradiso~, see Hollander ("Dante and the Martial Epic,"
^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989]: 62-91; Ital trans.: "Dante e l'epopea
marziale," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989], pp. 93-113), who, however,
fails to consider this verse as part of that resonance.

	|130-132.~  Around Mary, the central object in this picture, the
protagonist sees an assemblage of angels, apparently of all nine
orders, since they seem differentiated from one another in how bright
they shine and in what they do.

	|136-138.~  The ^topos~ of the inexpressibility of great beauty, now
that it is no longer needed for Beatrice (see the note to ^Par~.
XXX.22-27), is made to accompany Mary.

	|137.~  Dante's verb ^imaginar~ (referring to the mind's ability to
receive and store images received from outside it) is quite different
from the more modern instance of the word, with its clear reference to
invention of things not previously seen by the imaginer.  See the note
to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.13-18.

	|139-142.~  The canto concludes with Bernard, famous as the
"lover-poet" of Mary, gazing, alongside her newest "lover-poet," Dante
Alighieri.  His awareness of Bernard's affection for her makes his own
all the more ardent.

For a recent discussion of whether or not Dante is to be considered "a
mystic," see Steven Botterill ("Mysticism and Meaning in Dante's
^Paradiso~," in ^Dante for the New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda Barolini
and H. Wayne Storey [New York: Fordham University Press, 2003], pp.
143-51), who is mainly in the affirmative.  It is difficult to believe
that the final cantos of the poem, so obviously reflective of a great
mystic, St. Bernard, and so triumphantly presenting a final vision, can
be thought of as separate from the tradition of Western mysticism.  At
the same time, it is difficult to think of the earlier ninety-seven
cantos of the poem as being essentially mystical in character.  Thus
the best answer seems to be "no" and "yes" -- in that order.  But see
John Scott ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp.
407-8) for a cautious denial of even this much mysticism in Dante's
poetry.  One supposes that some (who find Dante's poetry more like
Blake's than not) think of him as a mystic, while others (who do not so
find) deny that he is one.

	|139.~  This is the sort of moment that might cause a doggedly
literal-minded reader to observe that Dante could not possibly have
observed the movement of Bernard's eyes because he was staring fixedly
at the Virgin.  For a passage that has indeed served as similar cause
of over-zealous concern for "realistic" details, see the note to
^Purg~. XXI.10-14.

	|140.~  The phrase ^fissi e attenti~ (fixed and intent) is repeated
here for the third time.  We heard it first in ^Purgatorio~ II.118,
used ^in malo~, for Dante and the newly arrived souls who are seduced
by Casella's song and require Cato's reprimand in order to get back on
their path toward God.  It then appears in ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.1, where
it describes Dante's gaze, fixed on Beatrice, trying to slake his
ten-year "thirst" for her presence.  That repetition was perhaps
intended to counter the first instance, the context of which was the
song that Dante had composed in favor of Beatrice's rival, the Lady
Philosophy (her identity at least according to the ^Convivio~ [first at
II.xii.9]).  Now it is used a second time ^in bono~, here referring to
Dante's new "lady," the Virgin.  Unlike the last one, this ocular
gesture does not reflect the rejection of one lady in favor of another.
 In Heaven there may be no marrying, but there is no limit to the
number of objects of one's affection.
