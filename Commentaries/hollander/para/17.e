	|1-12.~  We have come to the midpoint of ^Paradiso~.  See, for a
reading of this central canto, Giorgio Brugnoli ("^Paradiso~ XVII,"
^L'Alighieri~ 5 [1995]: 47-58), pointing out, among other things, that
the poet has underlined numerically this mathematical fact.  Brugnoli
demonstrates that the central cantos of the last canticle, XI-XXIII,
are arranged, at least in terms of the number of verses that they
contain, in a pattern, as follows (the two bordering cantos, excluded
from the pattern, are listed, in the table below, in ^italics~, only to
indicate how noticeably they break it):

\<pre\>
^X		148	= 13	---~
XI		139	= 13	******
XII		145	= 10	*****
XIII		142	=  7	****

\</pre\>

Apparently Brugnoli did not know the work of John Logan ("The Poet's
Central Numbers," ^Modern Language Notes~ 86 [1971]: 95-98), who had
already made the identical observation, also pointing out that this
pattern mirrored the pattern found in the line lengths of the central
thirteen cantos of ^Purgatorio~ precisely.  (For treatments of the
numerical center of the whole poem, see the reference at the conclusion
of the note to ^Purg~. XVII.124-125.)  All this certainly suggests that
the notion of marking the centers of ^cantiche~ so strikingly (if
subtly) only came to the poet belatedly.  And had that task not
required a forbiddingly difficult series of revisions, we may speculate
that he may have been tempted to redo the thirteen central cantos of
^Inferno~ (once he had decided exactly where that center was, whether
between 11 and 23 or 12 and 24), even at the cost of the by now
circulating first ^cantica~.  The midpoint of ^Inferno~ in fact falls
between Cantos XVII and XVIII, and has its own rather distinct sense of
a line being drawn across the parchment between those two distant
zones, Violence and Fraud.  However, while Marco Lombardo, the
"central" character of ^Purgatorio~, does speak near the center of the
canticle (he only misses being the speaker in the central canto of his
^cantica~ by one canto), Brunetto is at least two cantos away from his.
 There have been several who have tried to make a case for the
similarities among Brunetto, Marco, and Cacciaguida as "central"
characters; however, as much as they do seem related by their moral and
political concerns, as well as their magisterial and loving attitude
toward Dante, one wants to tread softly, given the precision of Dante's
numerical boundaries when he decides to turn them on, and the absence
of such indication in ^Inferno~, where the precise center is marked
only where it occurs, between the seventeenth and eighteenth cantos.
Such matters are neither weighty nor easily resolved.  However, it does
seem worth the effort to learn that sometimes an element in Dante's
"masterplan" was only added later.  As has often been pointed out, the
original plan for the work (at least from what we can gather from the
early cantos of the ^Commedia~) seems to have been to assign one sin to
each canto: neutrality (III), paganism (IV), lust (V), gluttony (VI),
avarice -- and prodigality (VII); and then the plan begins to fall
apart with sullen anger (VII and VIII); and finally it is jettisoned
with the walls of Dis and heresy (VIII-XI).  We should perhaps not be
surprised that the elaborate centering that occurs in the second and
third canticles is simply absent from the first.

For another and more recent attempt to deal with the "centers" of the
three canticles, see Riccardo Ambrosini ("Canto XVII," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 253-54).  His discussion begins
and ends with Singleton ("The Poet's Number at the Center," ^Modern
Language Notes~ 80 [1965]: 1-10), but is without reference to the work
of Logan and (still more surprisingly) of Brugnoli, and is thus not as
interesting as it might have been.

	|1-6.~  Phaeton sought reassurance from his mother, Clymene, against
the denial (on the part of his "half-brother in divinity," as it were,
Epaphus, a son of Io by Jove) of his origin from divine Apollo's seed
(see ^Metam~. I.747-789 [setting up the lengthy narrative of Phaeton's
disastrous chariot-ride, ^Metam~. II.1-400]).  So now does Dante wish
to be enlightened about the nature of the ills that will afflict him
after 1300, ills that he has heard prophesied in Hell and in Purgatory
(for all those prophetic passages [three of the last four are positive,
not worrisome], see the note to vv. 43-99), even if he is assured of
his eventual salvation.  Beatrice and Cacciaguida share the role of a
wiser Apollo, confirming his purpose without destroying him by allowing
a runaway journey through the heavens.  In Ovid's "tragic" narrative
Phaeton is, we remember, allowed to destroy himself through
over-enthusiastic evaluation of his own capacities as rookie
sun-driver; in Dante's comically resolved tale of his journey through
the heavens, we see the protagonist as a wiser (and better-aided)
version of Phaeton.

See Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical
Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 {1896}], p. 175), comparing
Cacciaguida's assurance that Dante will survive his troubles to the
Sibyl's similar gesture toward Aeneas (^Aen~. VI.95-96); Moore goes on
to mention both heroes' calm acceptance of their fates (cf. ^Aen~.
VI.103-105).  And see Schnapp ("Dante's Ovidian Self-Correction in
^Paradiso~ 17," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991], pp. 217-19) and Picone ("Dante
argonauta: la ricezione dei miti ovidiani nella ^Commedia~," in M.
Picone and B. Zimmermann, eds., ^Ovidius redivivus: von Ovid zu Dante~
[Stuttgart: M&P Verlag, 1994], pp. 181-82) for two particularly
interesting responses to these verses.  Also see Kevin Brownlee
("Phaeton's Fall and Dante's Ascent," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]:
135-44) for the "Phaeton program" in the ^Commedia~.

It is perhaps of interest that the male participants in this simile are
identified only by periphrasis (Phaeton, Apollo, Cacciaguida) or (in
the case of Dante) by a pronoun ^(io)~, while the female figures
(Clymene, Beatrice) are named.

	|7-12.~  These are the first words uttered by Beatrice since ^Paradiso~
XIV.18.  They repeat something we have been told several times now
(first at ^Par~. I.85-87), that the souls of the saved have the
capacity to read minds; thus speech addressing them, while technically
unnecessary, has the benefit to a mortal speaker of making his thoughts
clear to himself so that his questioners, all of whom are necessarily
saved souls, will have sufficient indication of what is "on his mind."
This only seems a curious notion; upon reflection it makes perfectly
good sense (i.e., if he has a confused thought in his mind, ^that~ is
what his celestial interrogator will read in it).  And what other
writer can we imagine having such a complex thought about thinking's
relationship to speech?

The metaphor of thirst as representing desire for knowledge has also
been before us previously in this canticle (first at ^Par~. II.19).  It
is here used by Beatrice as part of a severely mixed metaphor, since
she has at verse 7 referred to the ^vampa~ (ardor, flame) of Dante's
desire, now translated into water.  Heavenly stylists are obviously not
bound by the petty rules of mortal grammarians.

	|13-18.~  Dante's words to Cacciaguida make plain that he has
understood a vital difference between mortal intelligence and that of
the saints: The latter see, in the eternal present in God, even
contingencies (i.e., those things that might either happen or not
happen, in other words all possible occurrences, even those that in
fact never did, or do, or will occur [see ^Par~. XIII.63 and the note
to ^Par~. XIII.61-66]).  The best we mortals can do, by contrast, is to
grasp certain definitional truths, for example, that no triangle
(containing a total of 180+o~) can possess two angles each of which is
greater than 90+o~.

Where Phaeton wanted to know about his ancestry, Dante wants to know
from his ancestor (as we will learn in vv. 22-27) the path of his
future life.  However, both "sons" have absolutely in common the need
to be reassured.

	|13.~  The word ^piota~ refers to the sole of the foot (see ^Inf~.
XIX.120); here it may literally mean footprint while, in metaphor, it
would rather seem to signify "root"; Scartazzini (comm. to this verse)
discusses the Tuscan use of the noun to indicate the clump of earth
around the root system of blades of grass, etc.  And this seems the
best way to take this passage: Cacciaguida is the patch of earth from
which has sprung Dante's "plant."  Cf. ^Paradiso~ XV.88-89, where
Cacciaguida refers to himself as the "root" ^(radice)~ that has
produced Dante as its "bough" ^(fronda)~.  See Giorgio Petrocchi
("Canto XVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], p. 338).

	|15.~  This is the second (and last) appearance of the word "triangle"
in the poem (see ^Par~. XIII.102 for the first).

	|19-27.~  Dante refers to the various predictions of the course of his
future life that dot the first two canticles (see the note to vv.
46-99) and claims a serenity in the face of difficulty that some
readers find belied by his very questions.

	|19.~  It comes as something of a surprise to hear Virgil's name on
Dante's lips at this point, and for the first time in this canticle.
It is as though the Virgilian resonances of Canto XV.25-30 had stirred
the protagonist's loyalties (the last time we heard Virgil's name was
in company of Dante's unique nominal presence [^Purg~. XXX.55]).  This
is the penultimate of thirty-two appearances of the Roman poet's name
in the poem; the last will occur, in Adam's mouth, surprisingly enough,
at ^Paradiso~ XXVI.118 (an occurrence somehow overlooked by Kenelm
Foster ["^Paradis~o XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 94 {1976}: 72]).  Among
denizens of the afterworld, only Beatrice is more often present in name
(sixty-three occurrences), if that of God occurs even more often than
hers (more than a hundred times).

	|24.~  For the word "tetragon," see Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi
("^Paradiso~ XVII," in ^Filologia e critica dantesca: Studi offerti a
Aldo Vallone~ [Florence: Olschki, 1989], pp. 312-13) and Raffa (^Divine
Dialectic: Dante's Incarnational Poetry~ [Toronto: Toronto University
Press, 2000], pp. 164-78), both of whom consider the two sets of
meanings of the geometrical figure that may have influenced Dante's
choice of the word here, defensive (it was reckoned by several
authorities, including Aristotle and St. Thomas, to be the strongest
shape capable of withstanding assault) and more positive (in one
medieval tradition it is associated with Christ).

Chiavacci Leonardi (pp. 314-16) also adduces Boethius here, as model in
the widest possible sense.  In her view, he, like Dante, persecuted and
unjustly condemned, wrote a work of which he, again like Dante, was
both author and protagonist.

For the Cacciaguida episode as also reflecting the sixth book of
Cicero's ^De re publica~, known as the ^Somnium Scipionis~ (and in this
form commented on by Macrobius), see Schnapp (^The Transfiguration of
History at the Center of Dante's "Paradise"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1986], e.g., p. 62, but ^passim~) and Raffa (^ibid~.,
pp. 147-64).  And see Schnapp ("Dante's Ovidian Self-Correction in
^Paradiso~ 17," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991], p. 216), discussing the similarities
and differences between the prophecy offered by Brunetto in ^Inferno~
XV and that by Cacciaguida here.

	|27.~  Starting with Jacopo della Lana (comm. to this tercet), some
early commentators attribute a version of this saying ("Jaculum
praevisum minus laedit" [A javelin blow hurts the less if it is
foreseen]) to "Solomon"; others, later along, beginning with Daniello
(comm. to verse 27), say that it derives from a saying of Ovid's: "Nam
praevisa minus laedere tela solent" (For the blows of weapons that one
sees coming do not usually hurt as much) but without specifying where
in Ovid it is to be found.  (Daniello also refers to the "Solomonic"
^dictum~ first found in Jacopo della Lana.)  It was Venturi (comm. to
verse 27) who, while maintaining the attribution to Ovid, also kept the
first citation alive, but (correctly) reassigned it to Gregory the
Great and spiked the attribution to Solomon.  However, the phantom
attribution to Ovid lasted into the twentieth century, despite the fact
(which should have raised more suspicion than it did) that it had never
been assigned a specific source in any Ovidian text.  Finally, Vandelli
(in the Scartazzini/Vandelli comm. to verse 27), referring to an
article in ^BSDI~ (25 [1918], p. 108), reassigns the popular tag to the
Esopics of ^Waltherius anglicus~ (for Waltherius, see the note to
^Inf~. XXIII.4-18).  In this "school" are found also Paolo Brezzi ("Il
Canto XVII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-'81~, ed. S.
Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 447) and Massimiliano Chiamenti
(^Dante Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1995], p. 188).
However, Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 72, argues
for the pivotal role of Gregory the Great's ^Homilies~ (to Luke
21:9-19): "Minus enim iacula feriunt quae praevidentur" (For javelins
that one sees coming wound the less), rather than that of Waltherius
because, both in Gregory and in Dante, the context is of the greater
pain one suffers at the betrayal of one's friends than at the hands of
one's known enemies (Aversano points to Dante's sense of betrayal by
his fellow exiles as registered in vv. 61-66).

	|31-36.~  Set off against pagan dark and wayward speech is Christian
clarity of word and purpose.  Perhaps Dante refers to Sibylline
prophecy that resulted in human sacrifice (see the muffled but telling
reference to the killing of Iphigenia in ^Inferno~ XX.110-111).  Such
is opposed by a better sacrifice, that of the Lamb, who took on all our
sins (see, for the eventual biblical source of the phrase in the
liturgy, which pluralizes our sins ^[peccata]~, John 1:29: "Ecce agnus
Dei; ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi" [Behold the lamb of God; behold
the one who takes away the sins of the world]).

	|31.~  The word ^ambage~ has an interesting history.  Dante probably
found its most troubling presence in ^Aeneid~ VI.99, where ^ambages~
was used to typify the animal-like sounds of the cave-dwelling Sibyl's
prognostications.  On the other hand, and as Pio Rajna ("^Arturi regis
ambages pulcerrimae~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 1 [1902]: 91-99) has pointed
out, in Virgil, Ovid, and Statius it is also used to describe the
twisting path found in the Cretan labyrinth; it also in Virgil
indicates an enigmatic way of speaking.  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~
(I.x.2), giving the palm for prose eloquence to the French (to the
Proven$cals and Italians is reserved that for vernacular poetry
[I.x.3-4]), Dante had referred to the term.  The northerners are
recorded as composing biblical narratives, tales of Troy and Rome, and
the beautiful ^ambage~ (fictions) of King Arthur's court.  Thus the
word, a hapax in the poem, arrives in this context loaded with negative
associations.

	|32.~  The verb ^inviscarsi~ has been used twice before (^Inf~. XIII.57
and XXII.144).  In the first instance (where the verb's root is spelled
^invesc-~), Pier delle Vigne speaks of the guileful properties of words
(see Simone Marchesi ["The Knot of Language: 'Sermocinatio' and
'Contrapasso' for the Rhetoricians in Dante's ^Inferno~," ^Romance
Languages Annual~ 11 {1997}: 254-59]); the second passage describes
winged demons caught in the pitch over which they are playing a cruel
game with a sinner who temporarily outwits them.  The verb describes
the effects of birdlime, spread to entrap birds.  It was a favorite
word to Petrarch, who liked to describe Laura's beauty as imprisoning
him.

	|34-35.~  The word "latino" has caused debate, with the primary warring
interpretations being (1) it refers, as it has throughout ^Inferno~, to
things Italian (whether the country or, as twice in ^Paradiso~, its
language) and (2) it here means "Latin," for the negative reason that,
if it does not, then Dante has committed himself to a tautological
expression, since "chiare parole" (plain words) and "preciso latin"
(clear speech) signify the same thing.

For examples of arguments devoted to each of these views, see (for [1])
Claire Honess ("Expressing the Inexpressible: The Theme of
Communication in the Heaven of Mars,"  ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~
14-15 [Spring-Fall 1994], pp. 51-52) and (for [2]) Nereo Vianello
("Canto XVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M.
Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], pp. 593-94).  The view put
forward by Vianello does not admit that the two terms may predicate
differing things of Cacciaguida's speech.  However, the first term
^(chiare parole)~ may refer to his diction, the second ^(preciso
latin)~ to his syntactical command of the language, his substance and
his style, as it were.  See, for an example (and it is only the very
first example) of this poet's pleasure in "multi-predication,"
^Inferno~ I.5, "esta selva ^selvaggia~ e ^aspra~ e ^forte~"; in short,
Dante's usual habit would seem to support the first view.  Furthermore,
in the rest of the poem "latino" only once seems surely to refer to the
Latin language (^Par~. X.120).  On most other occasions it clearly
means "Italian" (^Inf~. XXII.65; XXVII.27; XXVII.33; XXVIII.71;
XXIX.88; XXIX.91; ^Purg~. XI.58; XIII.92; and here, where it is
employed for the last [thirteenth] time in the poem).  On three
occasions, its meaning is not pellucidly clear (^Purg~. VII.16; ^Par~.
III.63; XII.144), although on each of them it would seem likely to mean
"Italian."  And see Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses), arguing that
"latino," for Dante, Cecco Angiolieri, Cino da Pistoia, Boccaccio, and
others of the time, simply meant Italian.

	|37-42.~  The old (and apparently never successfully disposed of [if
what one hears in one's own classroom even now is any guide]) problem
that many an early Christian theologian felt he had to grapple with,
how God's foreknowledge does not limit the freedom of the will, is here
resolved in imagistic terms: God's knowing what you will do does not
cause you to do it, just as when you watch a ship moving downstream,
its motion is not propelled by your observing eyes.

	|37.~  Paolo Brezzi ("Il Canto XVII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli
anni 1979-'81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 448)
underlines the importance of the concept of contingency in this canto,
first at verse 16 ("contingenti") and then here ("contingenza"), as
opposed to those things that are eternal.  (See also the "cluster" of
concern with contingent things in ^Par~. XIII.63, XIII.64, and
XIII.69.)  The word (used as a verb) will re-emerge for a final
appearance in ^Paradiso~ XXV.1.

	|43-99.~  Cacciaguida's lengthy personal prophecy of the course of
Dante's future life, the ninth and final one in the poem (stopping,
strictly speaking, at verse 93, it is nonetheless exactly the same
length as the preceding eight put together), eclipses all that we have
learned from the four in ^Inferno~ (Ciacco, VI.64-75; Farinata,
X.79-81; Brunetto, XV.55-57, 61-66, 70-75; Vanni Fucci, XXIV.143-150)
and the four found in ^Purgatorio~ (Currado Malaspina, VIII.133-139;
Oderisi, XI.140-141; Bonagiunta, XXIV.37-38; Forese, XXIV.82-90).  See
Emilio Pasquini ("Il ^Paradiso~ e una nuova idea di figuralismo,"
^Intersezioni~ 16 [1996]: 419).  This is clearly meant to be taken as
the most important prognostication of Dante's personal involvement in
the political affairs of his world.  If we consider that each of the
first two canticles has four such passages and that this one, coming in
the central canto of the third, is so detailed, it becomes clear that
it is meant to overwhelm in importance all those that have preceded.
See Hollander ("Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992],
pp. 217-19) for the argument that Dante might have originally planned
for Beatrice to include Cino da Pistoia in her remarks about Dante's
life.  In Picone's incorrect representation ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 212n.) that hypothesis is said to
have included the suggestion that Dante originally planned for Cino to
be present among the crusading saints of Mars, an extravagant
proposition in itself, and one certainly not found in Hollander's
article.  The actual hypothesis is based in those two passages (^Inf~.
X.130-132 and  ^Inf~. XV.88-90) that surely promise that Beatrice will
be the one to reveal to Dante the course of his future life.  It goes
on to propose that the shift to Cacciaguida (and abandonment of a plan
to have Beatrice praise Cino for being Dante's true poetic brother) was
at least in part caused by Dante's reaction to the news of Cino's
denunciation of the imperial position shortly after the death of Henry
VII in 1313 and of his having joined the forces of the Guelph
inquisitors of Florence.  One can only imagine Dante's reaction to what
must have seemed to him Cino's betrayal of a shared trust.

Marguerite Mills Chiarenza ("Time and Eternity in the Myths of
^Paradiso~ XVII," in ^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in the
Italian Trecento in Honor of Charles S. Singleton~, ed. A. S. Bernardo
and A. L. Pellegrini [Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and
Studies, 1983)], p. 145) juxtaposes the two Ovidian myths found in this
canto, Phaeton and Hippolytus (see the note to vv. 46-48), arguing that
the first is emblematic of damnation, the second of salvation.

	|43-45.~  The first commentator to be clear about the problems of this
passage is Fallani (comm. to this tercet) referring to his gloss on
^Purg~. IX.144, in which he cites Casimiri's lecture of 1924.  Casimiri
insisted that there were no instances of singing to organ accompaniment
until the fifteenth century.  Fallani is of the opinion that some of
the early commentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana, the Ottimo, Francesco
da Buti, the Anonimo Fiorentino), when speaking of "il cantare degli
organi," probably were referring only to the harmony established by two
or more voices singing different notes, not to the musical instrument,
the organ.  For earlier discussion of this material, see the note to
^Purg~. IX.139-145.  And see Denise Heilbronn-Gaines ("^Paradiso~
XVIII," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17,
supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp.
266-76), arguing that here the singular form ^organo~ clearly marks
this reference as being to vocal polyphony, while the plural ^organi~
(as in ^Purg~. IX.144) refers to the musical instrument.  And for a
substantial argument that coincides with the main point of Fallani's
(the text refers to voices in contrapuntal harmony, not to the notes
played on an organ), see Leopoldo Chiappo ("La m$usica y los contrastes
de la vida," ^Lienzo~ [Universidad de Lima] 14 [1994: esp. 135-147).

No matter how discordant the sounds of his great-great-grandson's
coming travails may seem, Cacciaguida would seem to be insisting, they
will eventually be heard as harmony, at least once Dante's task is
completed.

	|46-48.~  At least since the time of Scartazzini, commentators have
recognized that the word indicating a cruel step-mother (^noverca~:
Phaedra, Florence) and that indicating a man unjustly exiled
(^immeritum~: Hippolytus, Dante) are found in a passage in Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~ (XV.497-505).  At least this seems to have been true in
the text of Ovid known to Dante, which had "immeritumque" where modern
texts show "meritumque."  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) point out
that the words ^exul immeritus~ found in four of Dante's thirteen
epistles likely come from this passage in Ovid and that Hippolytus, as
a result, should be considered a ^figura Dantis~.  And for Dante's
sense of himself as sharing with Ovid the experience of exile, see the
note to verses 55-57.

As Cacciaguida begins his lengthy series of predictions concerning
Dante's life, we may perhaps remember that two passages in ^Inferno~
(X.130-132 and XV.88-90) surely seem to promise that Beatrice will be
the one to reveal to Dante the course of his future life.  Several
readers have advanced hypotheses in order to account for Dante's
obvious change in plan, most notably Marguerite Mills Chiarenza.  For a
summary of her argument, see the note to ^Inferno~ X.130-132.  But see
also Bortolo Martinelli ("Cacciaguida oracolo di Dio [Paradiso
XV-XVII]," ^Italianistica~ 8 [1979]: 569-94), arguing that the
Anchises/Aeneas relationship in ^Aeneid~ VI was in fact the governing
reason for the change.

	|46.~  Marguerite Mills Chiarenza ("Hippolytus' Exile: ^Paradiso~ XVII,
vv. 46-48," ^Dante Studies~ 84 [1966]: 65-68 [and see also her "Time
and Eternity in the Myths of ^Paradiso~ XVII," in ^Dante, Petrarch,
Boccaccio: Studies in the Italian Trecento in Honor of Charles S.
Singleton~, ed. A. S. Bernardo and A. L. Pellegrini {Binghamton, NY:
Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1983}, pp. 133-50]) was
perhaps the first to examine the import to Dante of the rest of the
tale of Hippolytus: his restoration from death and his ensuing life in
exile from Athens under the name "Virbius."  She argues that Dante
could have known this part of Hippolytus's tale from Virgil (^Aen~.
VII.777) and from Ovid (^Metam~. XV.497-546 [a connection first
observed by Jacopo della Lana, comm. to vv. 46-48, if without naming
Virbius]).  (Dante might not have required the authority of Servius
[alluded to by Chiarenza] who etymologizes Hippolytus's posthumous name
as "bis vir" [twice a man], but simply seen these obvious Latin roots
himself.)  Chiarenza's conclusion is that the Virbius tradition gives
Dante much more than a political self-justification, namely, a sense of
his own spiritual second life.  On the other hand, it does limn in
precise parallel the Florentine's escape from the political dangers of
the world of "Thebes" (in ^Inferno~ an insistent stand-in for the
ailing and divided city of man on earth, the city of destruction that
surely reminded the poet of the internecine woes of Florence [see
^Inf~. XIV.69; XX.32; XXV.15; XXX.2; XXX.22; XXXII.11; XXXIII.89; there
are three references to the Greek city in ^Purgatorio~, but these are
rather more neutral in tone]).  See also Schnapp ("Dante's Ovidian
Self-Correction in ^Paradiso~ 17," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T.
Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991], pp. 220-23)
for the strategic implications of Dante's use of Ovid's exiled (and
eventually "redeemed") Hippolytus.  He concludes with this surmise:
Dante's own choice of first-person confessional narrative may have
provoked his "special emphasis" on Glaucus (in ^Par~. I) and here, at
the midpoint of this canticle, on Hippolytus.  Ovid's tellings of their
doings "are tales of deification narrated ^by the deified mortals
themselves~, whereas the great majority of Ovid's tales are recounted
by third parties" (p. 293).

	|49-51.~  If the reader has been missing Virgil, this canto brings his
name back into play (see the note to verse 19).  And if the reader has
missed the presence of one of Dante's favorite whipping boys, Pope
Boniface VIII, here he is, officiating over a corrupt Roman clergy that
makes its profit out of selling Christ.  We might almost be back in
^Inferno~ XIX rather than at the midpoint of ^Paradiso~.

	|51.~  How to translate ^tutto d@i~?  We have decided, finding little
help in the commentaries, that the phrase is more likely to refer to an
imagined single long day in the "marketplace" of the Vatican rather
than to an endless succession of days.  Both solutions are found in the
commentaries, the second more often.  However, it seems to us that the
sense of "all day long" is both more caustic and less obvious.

	|52-54.~  The poet looks back at his banishment, an "injured party"
indeed, from Florence; then he turns to God's swift retributive
justice, evident at least in the death of Boniface in 1303.  Some dates
that are pertinent here: Boniface was plotting against the Florentine
White Guelphs as early as April 1300 (or so Dante probably believed);
Dante was nearly certainly in Rome ca. October 1301; on 27 January 1302
the Whites were banished from Florence.  Possibly the most painful
period in Dante's life is rehearsed in these lines.  For an overview of
Dante's political identity, see Jacques Goudet ("La 'parte per se
stesso' e l'impegno politico di Dante," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol.
VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], pp. 289-316).

Perhaps encouraged by the use of the same noun at verse 69, where it
obviously does refer to a political party, some take the noun ^parte~
in verse 52 to refer to the White Guelphs.  On the other hand, since
Cacciaguida's entire prophecy is directed toward Dante's personal
future, we probably should understand that Dante himself is the
"offended party" whose innocence will be proclaimed in the vengeance he
will enjoy once God intervenes to set things right.  However, the first
to take the passage in this way appear to have been the
sixteenth-century commentators Alessandro Vellutello and Bernardino
Daniello (comms. to this tercet); nearly all the earlier ones take the
victims to be the exiled White Guelphs (including Dante, of course).
Since we will shortly hear, in only thinly veiled ways, of the enmity
Dante felt from his fellow Whites in exile (vv. 61-66), it would be
extremely odd for him to think of them as sharing his status as victim
here.  It really seems necessary to believe that this ^parte~, like
that in verse 69, is a party of one.

Vellutello (comm. to vv. 52-54), perhaps following the lead of
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 46-57) in citing these particulars, is
of the opinion that signs of Dante's "revenge" were evident in the
various Florentine disasters of the spring of 1304; these are recounted
more fully elsewhere (in his comm. to ^Inf~. XXVI.7-9): the collapse of
the Ponte alla Carraia because of the vast crowds of those who had
assembled on the bridge to watch a spectacle enacted on the river below
in which Hell was displayed (a "spectacle" that Dante himself would
within several years begin to produce in writing, possibly with this
one in mind); the civil war between the White and the Black Guelphs;
and the terrible fire that destroyed 1700 houses in the city (see
Villani, ^Cron~. VIII.70-71).  Over the years there have been other
candidates as well.  The facts that these events were so cataclysmic
(two major disasters and a civil war), involved such dramatic loss of
life and destruction of property, seemed indeed like God's punishment
upon the city, and occurred so soon after Dante was exiled (a mere two
years), all combine to give continuing support to Vellutello's
hypothesis.  Of course, there were other notable events that the poet
might have considered the result of God's hand smiting the enemies of
Dante Alighieri, "a Florentine by birth but not in his behaviors"
(^Dantes Alagherii florentinus natione non moribus~, as he describes
himself in the salutation of the ^Epistle to Cangrande~), for instance
the death of Boniface VIII in 1303 (the choice of some commentators) or
of Corso Donati in 1308 (the choice of others).  Other commentators
have put forward, in various permutations, both these alternatives to
the events of 1304: Benvenuto da Imola: the death of Corso Donati,
referred to in ^Purg~. XXIV.83-84 (Benvenuto, comm. to vv. 52-54);
Benvenuto is followed in this (as in so many particulars) by John of
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 49-54); Campi (comm. to vv. 52-54) dislikes
the Buti/Vellutello hypothesis, because Dante would not, in his view,
have taken pleasure in the loss of so many innocent lives, and combines
Corso Donati and Boniface VIII in a single retributive bundle (one that
will continue to be found in commentaries of the twentieth century);
Torraca (comm. to vv. 52-54), in an otherwise well thought out note,
opts for Boniface VIII; Porena (comm. to vv. 52-54) makes a good case
for the death of Boniface, the three events of 1304, and the death of
Corso as ^all~ being condign punishments of those who betrayed the city
to the French.  However, everything in this lengthy passage is centered
both on Dante and on his feckless fellow Florentines.  For this reason
Vellutello's interpretation seems more worthy of attention than others.
 For the elements of Dante's life reflected in this passage, see
Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 52-69), citing ^Convivio~ I.iii.3 and
Boethius (^Cons. Phil.~ I.4[pr]).

	|55-57.~  The protagonist has asked his ancestor to provision him
against the "slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune" (verse 27);
Cacciaguida now responds by referring to the sharpest wound of all: his
exile.  For Dante's sense of himself as the Italian Ovid, see Janet L.
Smarr ("Poets of Love and Exile," in ^Dante and Ovid: Essays in
Intertextuality~, ed. Madison U. Sowell [Binghamton, NY: Medieval &
Renaissance Texts & Studies, 1991], pp. 139-51).  From her observation
that Ovid casts himself in the role of wandering Ulysses in both the
^Tristia~ and the ^Ars amatoria~, she argues that Dante takes Ovid as a
negative version of himself.  For another treatment of Ovid as Dante's
counterpart in exile, see Picone ("Dante, Ovidio e la poesia
dell'esilio," ^Rassegna europea di letteratura italiana~ 14 [1999]:
7-23).  And see the note to vv. 46-48.

	|58-60.~  One of the most celebrated tercets in the poem, bringing home
to the reader the poet's daily sense of abandonment in his exilic
condition, a necessary guest even under the best of circumstances (and
with the most benign of hosts).  The poet's understatement catches
perfectly the rhythm of the exile's daily round, going downstairs with
perhaps some sense that this day may bring tidings betokening a
possible return to Florence, and then mounting back up at night with
the deadened senses of one who knows that life will probably merely
continue as it is.

	|58.~  Strangely enough, the meaning of this verse is much debated.
From the beginning, all have agreed that it refers to the bitter taste
of bread (or anything else) eaten in bitter conditions.  The
"unofficial commentary tradition," that is, ordinary readers, however,
senses a reference to the way bread is prepared in Florence (to this
day): It is baked without salt.  Pietrobono (comm. to vv. 58-60) is the
first commentator even to refer to that fact and simply denies its
relevance (thus revealing that some discussants had raised this issue),
insisting on the larger and obvious meaning.  (He cites the often-cited
passage in ^Convivio~ [I.iii.4] in which Dante laments his exilic
experience.)  Fallani (comm. to vv. 58-60) explains that the salty
taste is supplied by the exile's tears.

Longfellow (comm. to this verse) cites several pertinent passages,
including Ecclesiasticus 29:24 [29:31-32 in the Vulgate] and 40:28-29
[29-30]: "It is a miserable thing to go from house to house; for where
thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.  Thou shalt
entertain and feast, and have no thanks: moreover, thou shalt hear
bitter words...."  "My son, lead not a beggar's life, for better it is
to die than to beg. The life of him that dependeth on another man's
table is not to be counted for a life."  He also cites Shakespeare's
^Richard II~ (III.1):

\<pre\>
			Myself
Have stooped my neck under your injuries,
And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitter bread of banishment.
\</pre\>

	|61-69.~  Dante became "a party of one" (verse 69) when he was
disgusted with the efforts of his fellow exiles to make their way back
into Florence, ca. 1304.  His correctness (we imagine a large meeting
in which Dante was able to accomplish what the American comedian Mort
Sahl, some five minutes into one of his scabrous and rollicking
routines, used to ponder: "Is there anyone here I haven't offended
yet?") about the folly of their preparations was, as far as he was
concerned, reflected in their crushing defeat (an army of more than
10,000 men was routed, leaving 400 dead behind) by the Black Guelphs at
the fortress Lastra a Signa, three kilometers from the walls of
Florence, on 20 July 1304, during which battle Dante was in Arezzo.  By
a twist of circumstance, that put him there on the very day Francesco
Petrarca was born in that city.

Lombardi (comm. to these verses) ridicules the idea (as put forward by
Landino) that this passage ends by indicting Corso Donati, or even
Vieri de' Cerchi.  It clearly refers to his former allies of the exile,
predominantly White Guelphs.

	|65-66.~  While some of the earlier commentators (e.g., Portirelli to
vv. 61-69) see the red of bloody wounds to the head, the majority of
them think only of the red of a guilty blush.  Dante's point would seem
to be that theirs would be no ordinary blushes (infusing only the
cheeks with color), but would cover their entire countenances, even up
to the hairline.  In modern times, Scartazzini (comm. to verse 66)
began the tradition of seeing both meanings in the line.  That line of
attack has, however, had little success, and twentieth-century
commentators are fairly evenly divided in choosing one or the other.
However, the phrase does seem a strange way to indicate those lying
dead on the field of battle, since we assume that most of them were not
killed by blows to the head (nor imagined as having blood from their
other wounds or from the wounds of others staining their heads), while
all of his former allies must (in Dante's view) now feel ashamed (i.e.,
are blushing) for having turned against him, reviling his opposition to
their bankrupt and eventually anti-Florentine schemes.  Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to vv. 64-66) object that blushes cover one's cheeks, not the
forehead.  But that, perhaps, is exactly Dante's point: This is no
ordinary blush, but burns on all the exposed parts of the face,
"blushing to the roots of their hair," as the English expression has it.

That the most labored description of a blush found in the entire poem
resides in the following canto (vv. 64-69) may seem to offer evidence
in favor of the view that this passage also represents the identical
facial phenomenon; that, however, is not necessarily a convincing
argument.

	|66.~  The word ^valle~ (valley) is nearly universally treated as part
of a moral landscape (referring to this period before the battle of La
Lastra, the lowpoint of Dante's exile).  Is it not possible, however,
that Dante remembers the physical landscape in which that meeting took
place, somewhere beneath Arezzo?

	|67-69.~  The only other appearance of the noun ^bestialitade~ is in
^Inferno~ XI.83, where its meaning is much debated.  See the note to
^Inferno~ XI.76-90 and Fosca's commentary to that passage (vv. 79-84)
for the minority opinion, followed here, that ^bestialitade~ refers to
the lowest form of fraud, treachery, as surely Dante sees his supposed
allies among the White Guelphs (and those fellow-traveling exiled
Ghibellines who had joined forces with them), who deserted Dante's
advocacy of the proper initiative against the Black Guelph rulers of
the city.  (Of course we know nothing of the matter(s) in dispute, just
that there was a dispute and that it was pivotal and had a dramatic
result, the defeat at La Lastra.)  We remember that Antenora was the
zone of Cocytus in which we found those who had betrayed country or
party (^Inferno~ XXXII.70-XXXIII.90), possibly the very sin Dante
attributed to his fellow exiles, effectively dooming the cause and
leaving him to form a "party of one."

The context of this entire passage, vv. 52-75, is unabashedly
Dante-centered, so much so that even the most zealous lover of this
poet may feel the stinging warmth of embarrassment stealing up and over
his face, blushing to the roots of his hair.

	|70-71.~  Some commentators explain that, while Verona was not in fact
the first place that Dante was received as he began his twenty years of
exile (he did not arrive there for between one year and two [in 1303 or
1304] after he left Rome in 1302), it was nonetheless his first "real"
shelter.

The succession of the Scaligeri, the ruling family of Verona in Dante's
time, was as follows: Mastino della Scala had become the ruler in 1262;
he was succeeded by his brother Alberto in 1277.  Alberto died in 1301
and was succeeded, in turn, by each of his three sons: Bartolommeo (who
died in March 1304), Alboino (who died late in 1311, having just been
named by Henry VII his imperial vicar, a title passed along at his
death to his younger brother, who had joined him in joint rulership in
1308), and Cangrande (the youngest, born in 1291 and who died in 1329,
eight years after Dante's death).  (Alberto also sired their
illegitimate half brother Giuseppe, abbot of San Zeno [see ^Purg~.
XVIII.124].)  According to what, after Petrocchi's work, has become a
widespread understanding, Dante left Verona soon after the accession of
Alboino in 1304 and returned in 1312 or 1313, that is, once Cangrande
had assumed sole power.  It has become an assumption in Dante studies
that for some reason Dante and Alboino just did not get along, thus
explaining the poet's eight years or more of absence from a city for
which he obviously felt deep affection.

For a sketch of the historical situation after Cangrande's accession to
unshared power, after Alboino died in 1311, see Raoul Manselli
("Cangrande e il mondo ghibellino nell'Italia settentrionale alla
venuta di Arrigo VII," in ^Dante e la cultura veneta~, ed. V. Branca
and G. Padoan [Florence: Olschki, 1966], pp. 39-49).  Manselli takes
Dante's praise of Cangrande as genuine, since he was the only one
active on the scene whom Dante considered capable, both in his personal
qualities and by virtue of his political position, of carrying out the
lofty imperial mission unsuccessfully initiated by Henry VII.  One way
of putting this is that Dante, having abandoned his early hopes for
Cangrande's political leadership, apparent in ^Inferno~ I in the
prophecy of the Veltro (which eventually yielded to those for Henry,
expressed in the prophecy of the 515/DXV in ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII), now,
in the wake of Henry's death in 1313, has no option except to return to
those early hopes in Cangrande once more.  Given the political
situation, the stubborn Imperial Vicar, who refused to yield that title
even though the Emperor was dead, seemed to Dante to be the political
entity most capable of uniting the imperial forces in Italy.  Those who
will agree with this estimate are probably few, but it does seem
defensible in light of the historical context.

There is a large literature devoted to what was at one time a vexed
question: Which Scaliger governed Verona when Dante first arrived?  Now
just about all agree that it was Bartolommeo.  For a summary of the
dispute, in English, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 70-75).  For a fuller
treatment, summarizing the entire debate and concluding, with nearly
all the early commentators, that Bartolommeo was indeed Dante's first
meaningful supporter in his exile, see Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 70-93).

	|72.~  See Tozer (comm. to vv. 71-72): "The arms of the Scaligers were
a golden ladder in a red field, surmounted by a black eagle, which was
the imperial ensign."  Unfortunately for Dante's sake, this insignia
was not chosen by the Scaligeri (at the earliest, by Bartolommeo)
before 1301.  By making it present now, in 1300, the poet hurries
history along faster than it wants to go.

	|73-75.~  That is to say, Bartolommeo and Dante will grant one
another's requests even before the other can make them, while in most
cases the granting follows much later than the asking (i.e., it may not
be forthcoming at all).  Carroll (comm. to vv. 70-75) points out that
Boccaccio reports that Dante's relationship with Guido Novello in
Ravenna was as Dante himself here says that it was with Bartolommeo.

	|76-90.~  Commentators agree that this passage refers to Cangrande
della Scala, one of the great figures of his time in northern Italy.
He was indeed a "son of Mars," a fearless and fabled warrior, and a man
of, in Dante's eyes, impeccable political convictions, an extreme
supporter of Emperor Henry while he lived, and a man who refused to
relinquish his title as imperial vicar even when the pope insisted that
he do so (since there was no longer an emperor to be vicar to).  For a
portrait of the man and his court, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 76-93).

It has seemed reasonable to some to point out that Cangrande was too
young in 1300 to be the subject of so dramatic a prophecy (not to
mention the one in ^Inf~. I, if that, also, applies to him), since he
was only nine years old in 1300 and only around fourteen or fifteen
when Dante began writing the poem.  However, those who have made this
argument have neglected to take three things into account: First,
stories about Cangrande as a child prodigy were abundant (e.g., in one
such the boy is depicted as being shown a chest, opened to reveal the
coins and jewels it contains; he reaches out and covers that pelf back
over with its cloth: See Cacciaguida's words in vv. 83-84 and
Benvenuto's gloss to them [comm. to vv. 82-84]; and see the similar
sentiment expressed of the ^veltro~, ^Inf~. I.103); second, Cangrande
had been named commander in chief of the Veronese armies before he was
in his teens; third, and in general, expectations of the princes of
royal houses and other such luminaries were simply out of all
proportion to our own expectations of the young.  See the note to
^Inferno~ I.100-105.  Further, if this later passage was written when
Cangrande was well into his twenties, as it undoubtedly was, it is not
surprising that it looks to him to take over the role of the ^veltro~
and of the "five hundred ten and five."  But see the note to ^Paradiso~
XXVII.142-148.

	|78.~  What does Dante imagine Cangrande will accomplish politically?
Somehow, he apparently must think, Cangrande will finish the task that
Henry started but failed to complete, the re-establishment of
conditions leading to the refounding of Aeneas's Rome.  That is the
only surmise possible that might justify the amazingly positive things
said throughout this eventually unexpressed (or better, suppressed [see
vv. 92-93]) prophecy.  It is not, perhaps, "officially" one of the
three "world prophecies" that appear, one in each ^cantica~ (^Inf~. I,
^Purg~. XXXIII, ^Par~. XXVII), but it reflects the first two of them
and informs the third.

Scartazzini (comm. to verse 92) makes the following observation about
the series of major prophecies: In ^Inferno~ I and ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII
(he might have added ^Paradiso~ XXVII) Dante leaves us in doubt about
the identity of the one who will come to set things right, while here
he tells us who he is, but not what he shall do.

	|79-81.~  Dante takes the sticks out of the hands of those who would
beat him about the head for prognosticating such things about a mere
child.  See the note to verses 76-90.  Giorgio Brugnoli ("^Paradiso~
XVII," ^L'Alighieri~ 5 [1995]: 48n.) is of the opinion that Cangrande's
age in 1300 (he was in fact, and as this passage represents things,
nine years old) is only a "symbolic" number, possessing no
chronological value whatsoever.  To be sure, "nine" is a particularly
potent number for Dante, but Brugnoli ignores such voices from the
commentary tradition as Benvenuto's that tell us at least one key
detail about Cangrande's contemporary reputation as ^Wunderkind~.  And
thus, when Dante first came to Verona, it is nearly a certainty that he
heard such tales about the boy, already general-in-chief of the city's
military forces.

	|81.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 75, in a
long note to this verse, points out various things: (1) the
stars/heavens are a part of every passage in which Dante speaks of the
prognosticated political "savior" who will "save" Italy from the
corruption of avarice: ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.41 (prophecy of the DXV);
^Paradiso~ XX.13 (when will the slayer of the wolf appear?) and
XXVII.144 (prophecy of the ^fortuna~ [storm at sea] that will reverse
the course of the "fleet"); (2) the prophecy of the ^veltro~ (^Inf~.
I.101-105) recalls the words of Luke 1:13-17 prophesying the birth,
temperance, and conversionary power of John the Baptist; (3) further
evidence is provided by the prophetic words of both St. Peter (^Par~.
XXVII.61-63) and Beatrice (^Par~. XXVII.142-148), the first predicting
the imminent appearance of an "heir" to Scipio (who will put Italy back
in order after the depredations of the papacy), the second foretelling
the advent of a new emperor.  Making a similar argument on different
grounds, Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 90-91, 180-91) focuses on the
prophecy in the ^Aeneid~ (I.286-296) of the peace-bringer Augustus and
goes on to argue for the likely presence of Cangrande in the ^veltro~.

	|82-84.~  The "Gascon" (Pope Clement V) first led Henry on and then
tried to undermine his imperial efforts.  The date most commentators
affix to the pope's open hostility to Henry is 1312, when the emperor
hoped to be crowned (a second time in Italy) in St. Peter's, but was
put off and finally relegated by decision of Clement to St. John
Lateran, outside the walls of the city and in ruins.  The "sparks" of
virtue with which Cangrande is credited here may have been his
demonstrations of support for the emperor; similarly, his "toil" is
perhaps his effort, unrewarded, on Henry's behalf (for this view, see
Carroll [comm. to vv. 76-93]).  More likely, the first signs of virtue
apparent in his not caring for worldly possessions was, apparently, a
part of his "legend" (see the note to vv. 76-90); as for the ^affanni~
(toils) he does not complain about, most who remark on them take them
as referring to his military exercises.  And for a Veronese poet's
epitaph for Cangrande, focusing on the martial aspect of his life, see
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 91-93), citing the words of one Raynaldus.

	|85.~  Poletto (comm. to vv. 85-87) makes the point that only Beatrice
(^Par~. XXXI.88) and the Virgin (^Par~. XXXIII.20) are allowed to share
this word with Cangrande.  See also the first word of the dedication to
him of ^Epistle~ XIII, "Magnifico."

Nereo Vianello ("Canto XVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 582)
suggests that Dante's shame about his actual father, a person of little
consequence and not particularly honest ways, lies behind his portrait
of Cacciaguida as his "true" father.

	|89-90.~  Steiner was the first among the commentators to see the
possible connection with a part of Mary's hymn of praise for her Lord,
Luke 1:52-53: "He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted
them of low degree.  He has filled the hungry with good things; and the
rich he has sent empty away."  In light of this scriptural connection,
Porena (comm. to these verses) thinks of Cangrande as a sort of Lombard
Robin Hood.

	|91-93.~  It is difficult to see how this blank "prophecy" of the
things that will be accomplished by Cangrande, imperial vicar that he
was and insisted on being even after Henry's death, is anything but
"imperial" in nature.  (Henry, betrayed by Pope Clement V in 1312, is
referred to a few lines ago [verse 82]).  See Giuseppe Di Scipio
("Dante and Politics," in ^The "Divine Comedy" and the Encyclopedia of
Arts and Sciences: Acta of the International Dante Symposium, 13-16
November 1983, Hunter College, New York~, ed. G. Di Scipio and A.
Scaglione [Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1988], pp. 267-84) for a
convincing attack on Alessandro Passerin D'Entr@eves (^Dante as a
Political Thinker~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1955]) for denying
Dante's significant involvement with imperial ideas (in favor of
religious orthodoxy), a position that simply fails to account for such
clearly political (and imperial) passages as these.

It seems likely that Dante's optimism about Cangrande's future deeds is
more the result of desperation than hope.  Here was a man who had
decided, upon precious little evidence, when he was writing the fourth
book of ^Convivio~, that the Roman Empire would be active once more.
Within a decade an emperor comes down to Italy and behaves like the new
Charlemagne, as far as Dante is concerned.  One can only imagine (but
the edgy tone of his second epistle to the emperor tells us a great
deal about his growing disillusionment) the bitterness he felt once
Henry had died in 1313.  And now, some four or five years later, here
he is, shouting at the top of his lungs, "The emperor is dead, long
live the emperor!"  He had, with little in the way of hard evidence,
simply decided that Rome must rise again.  And events made him correct.
 If Italy had not been ready for Henry (see ^Par~. XXX.137-138), it
would have to be ready for what Cangrande would do to clear the path
for the ^next~ emperor.  It may not be excessive to suggest that Dante
felt as "keyed in" to the political events of his day, even before they
occurred, as Fyodor Dostoyevski felt himself endowed with prescience
about those of his time.
Carolyn Calvert Phipps (in a seminar in 1980) pointed out that there is
a possible dependence here on the prophetic book referred to in the
Apocalypse (10:4): "Signa quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua: et noli ea
scribere" (Seal up those things which the seven thunders said and write
them not).  This is the instruction given John by the angel who brings
him God's prophetic book for him to ingest.  What makes Professor
Phipps's observation particularly worthy of study is that there may be
another possible visitation of the tenth chapter of the Apocalypse in
this canto; see the note to vv. 130-132.  It may also be true that the
continuation of this passage (Apoc. 10:9-10) may have offered Dante a
model for Beatrice's eating his heart in the dream recorded in ^Vita
nuova~ III.6.

For an unusual response to this unexpressed prophecy, see Jacopo della
Lana (comm. to vv. 91-93), who thinks Dante is holding back positive
predictions just in case Cangrande lost his appreciation for this poem,
as well as for its maker, and failed to give him the reward he expected.

	|94-96.~  Concluding, Cacciaguida characterizes his utterances over the
last seventeen tercets (vv. 43-93) as ^chiose~ (glosses); this long
prophetic passage is unique in the poem, both for its length and for
its personal import for the protagonist.  It is divided into three
sections, lines 43-69 (the pains of exile [Dante]); 70-75 (the first
stay in Verona [Bartolommeo]); 76-93 (the second stay in Verona
[Cangrande]).

What exactly do these "glosses" predict of Dante's difficult life as an
exile?  See the note to verses 52-54 for the range of possibilities
according to the commentators.  And to what specific prognostications
do they respond, only Cacciaguida's here or to some of the earlier ones
we heard in the first two ^cantiche~, and if so, to which ones?  We can
say with some security that only the first section of his ancestor's
prophecy, that concerning Dante's harsh political fate, is involved.
It is worth remarking that the time frame that Cacciaguida seems to
have in mind is short ^(a pochi giri)~, and that thus we should
probably think that the events of 1304, just four revolutions of the
heavens away from the date on which he speaks (1 April 1300), are
likely what he has in mind.

The word ^chiose~, of which this is the last appearance, has been under
our eyes three times before, the first two associated, as is this last
one, with prognostications of Dante's personal future: those of
Brunetto Latini (^Inf~. XV.89) and of Oderisi da Gubbio (^Purg~.
XI.141).  The third, however, is found in Hugh Capet's remarks to Dante
(^Purg~. XX.99), addressing his curiosity about something that Hugh had
said about the Virgin Mary.

While all commentators take the demonstrative pronoun "queste" to refer
to all that Cacciaguida has to say about all the (pertinent) prophecies
that Dante has heard in the first two canticles about his future
difficulties, when one first reads verse 94, one would be forgiven for
understanding a reference to the "cose / incredibili" of vv. 92-93.
And if one follows that understanding where it quite naturally leads,
the suppressed prophetic words about Cangrande (rather than all the
predictions combined) are the "glosses" that explain everything, an
explanation both potentially true and absurd, Dante's little
post-modern joke at his own expense).

	|97-99.~  Cacciaguida's repeated promise of Dante's vindication in the
punishment of his enemies sounds very much as it did when it first was
uttered in vv. 53-54.  As for the notion contained in the neologism
^s'infutura~ (present tense of Dante's coinage, ^infuturarsi~ [lit. "to
infuture oneself"]), ever since the early days of the commentary
tradition at least some have argued that it would have been bad taste
and out of keeping with Christian doctrine (not to mention the poet's
own stated views) for Dante to have boasted at having survived his
enemies in the flesh.  Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to this tercet) does
not even consider this possibility, referring only to Dante's honorable
name as what will survive him, and survive longer than the dishonor of
his enemies.  Nonetheless, such a vaunt has been a long-standing trait
in those who have survived the threatening behaviors of such powerful
enemies as Boniface VIII (dead in 1303) or Corso Donati (dead in 1308).
 (Boniface is mentioned in this context by several commentators,
although it is a bit of a stretch to believe that Dante thought of him
as a "neighbor.")  Porena points out (comm. to this tercet) that the
"orthodox" interpretation, ridding Dante of a perhaps petty desire to
outlive his enemies, makes little sense, since his immortal longings
(see vv. 119-120) are considerably grander than the afterlives he
foresees for his Florentine enemies, clearly meant to be in oblivion
while Dante lives on.  If that was his wish, he has been rewarded.

	|100-102.~  The metaphor, drawn from weaving, has it that Cacciaguida
has finished answering Dante's question (the "warp") with his response
(the "woof"), thus completing the pattern.  See the earlier use of a
similar metaphor, describing Piccarda's words (^Par~. III.95-96).

	|103-105.~  A "pseudo-simile" (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.136-141) in
which the protagonist is compared to someone -- very much like himself
-- asking a question of a person whom he trusts and loves - exactly
such a one as Cacciaguida.

	|106-107.~  The metaphorical presentation of time as a (currently
unseen) adversary in a duel on horseback captures the feelings of a
person surprised by history and now realizing the enormity of his
self-deluding former sense of security.

	|108.~  That is, time saves its heaviest blows for the one who is least
aware of its relentless advance.  See the similar thought expressed at
vv. 23-24.

	|109-111.~  This tercet sounds a rare (and disingenuous) note of
caution on the poet's part.  If he will lose his native city within two
years because of his obstinate adherence to telling the truth, should
not he then consider mitigating his bitter words in complaint of the
human iniquity found in other parts of Italy lest he be denied shelter
and support in his exile?  Since we have read the poem (which he only
imagines writing at this point), we know that he did not succumb to the
Siren song of "safety first."  However, and as Carroll suggests (comm.
to vv. 106-120), "In those days of the vendetta it is a marvel that a
sudden knife in the heart did not send Dante to make actual
acquaintance with that invisible world whose secrets he feigned to
know."

	|111.~  For a source of this verse, Giorgio Brugnoli ("^Paradiso~
XVII," ^L'Alighieri~ 5 [1995]: 56-57) cites Ovid, ^Tristia~ II.207:
"Perdiderint cum me duo crimina, carmen et error..." (Although two
crimes, one a poem, one a mistake, shall have brought me to
perdition...).  This text, highly familiar and certainly most
applicable to Dante, is somehow almost entirely lacking from the
commentary tradition, appearing only once before, in Boccaccio's ^Vita
Ovidii~ (in his comm. to the literal sense of ^Inf~. IV.90), and never,
or so it seems, in the context of Dante's own exile.

	|112-120.~  Less an example of ^captatio benevolentiae~ than a sort of
insistence on an inexcusable but necessary rudeness, this passage,
recapitulating the journey until here and now, the midpoint of the
third "kingdom," seeks our acceptance of the poet's revealing the harsh
things that he has learned in Hell, Purgatory, and the first five of
the heavens.  While he might have won the goodwill of some of us by
gilding the lily, as it were, he would have lost his claim on the rest
of us (we do indeed call Dante's time "ancient," do we not?).  For we
want truth in our poetry, not blandishment.

	|118.~  Beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), the
Aristotelian provenance of this gesture has been amply noted (the
beginning of the ^Ethics~ [I.4]): "For friends and truth are both dear
to us, but it is a sacred duty to prefer the truth."  Dante himself has
quoted or referred to this ^dictum~ on at least three occasions
(^Conv~. IV.viii.13; ^Mon.~ III.i.3; ^Epist.~ XI.11).  Cf. also the
frequently cited Aristotelian tag, "Assuredly, I am Plato's friend, but
I am still more a friend to truth."

	|119.~  Brunetto had taught him how to make himself immortal, "come
l'uom s'etterna"  (^Inf~. XV.85).  It is not, we can assume, by
flattering one's hosts.  Brunetto seems to have been on Dante's mind in
this context; see the note to verses 121-122.

	|121-122.~  Cacciaguida's shining presence is verbally reminiscent of
the identical phrasing found in ^Inferno~ XV.119, where Brunetto refers
to his own work (for the question of exactly which work, whether
^Tresor~ or ^Tesoretto~, see the note to ^Inf~. XV.119, and Hollander
["Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 {1992}: 228, n. 82])
as ^il mio Tesoro~, the same words that we find here, used of
Cacciaguida.  Are we perhaps to believe that, for Dante, Cacciaguida is
a better, truer "father" than Brunetto?  See Ricardo J. Quinones
(^Dante Alighieri~ [Boston: Twayne, 1979], pp. 174-76) and Frank
Ordiway (^Dante, Chaucer, and the Poetics of the Past~ [unpublished
doctoral dissertation, Princeton University, 1990]) on Brunetto's
replacement by Cacciaguida.

This is the sixth appearance (of seven) in the poem of the word
^tesoro~.  It first appeared in ^Inferno~ XV.119 (where Brunetto Latini
alludes to his book of that title); then in ^Inferno~ XIX.90 (where
Christ wants no "treasure" from Peter in compensation for the spiritual
gifts He bestows upon him [as opposed to Simon Magus, who wants to
acquire such gifts for a price]).  In the first canto of the last
canticle (^Par~. I.11), the poet refers to the "treasure" of God's
kingdom that he has been able to store in his memory; the word is then
found in ^Paradiso~ V.29 (where it refers to God's greatest gift to
humankind, the freedom of our will), X.108 (representing the worldly
goods that Peter Lombard renounced in order to follow Christ); and
finally in XXIII.133 (designating the treasure in heaven of Matthew
6:20 [and/or 19:21], as Tommaseo [comm. to vv. 133-135] was apparently
the first commentator to observe).  That last reference eventually
colors all that precedes it.  In the final reckoning, worldly treasure
is measured against this sole standard.  And thus the word ^tesoro~,
which begins its course through the poem as the title for one of
Brunetto Latini's works (by which he hopes to have achieved
"immortality" in the world, a contradiction in terms), is examined and
re-examined in such ways as to suggest either the desirability of
renunciation of earthly "treasure" or the preferability of its heavenly
counterpart, that "treasure in Heaven" that we may discover through the
exercise of God's greatest gift to us, our true treasure here on earth,
the free will, in our attempt to gain a better (and eternal) reward.

The poet's clear enthusiasm for his ancestor's noble sacrifice at least
casts into doubt the central thesis of Brenda Deen Schildgen's article
("Dante and the Crusades," ^Dante Studies~ 116 [1998]: 95-125) and book
(^Dante and the Orient~ [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2002]),
namely, that Dante did not promote crusading in the Holy Land, a
position that may have the advantage of having a certain vogue among
those who find crusading distasteful, but no other.

It seems strange, but notice of the obvious self-citation evident in
this second deployment of the phrase "il mio tesoro" seems to be of
fairly recent vintage.  See Madison Sowell ("Brunetto's ^Tesoro~ in
Dante's ^Inferno~," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 7 [1990]: 66-67) and
John Freccero ("The Eternal Image of the Father," in Rachel Jacoff and
Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in
Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991], p.
64).  See also Hollander ("Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~
110 [1992]: 217 and note 87).

	|122.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 77, cites
Ovid (^Metam~. I.768-769) for Dante's verb ^corusca~, but then goes on
to suggest that a more likely source is found in Ezechiel 1:14, the
^gloria Domini~ before He invests Ezechiel with prophetic powers.

	|124-135.~  Cacciaguida admits that Dante's truth-telling will hurt all
those who either themselves have given offense or who bear the sins of
their relations on their consciences, but encourages him to tell the
whole truth and nothing but the truth.

	|127-129.~  This tercet contains terms that have a possible relevance
to Dante's sense of his own poeticizing.  First, there is ^menzogna~ (a
reference to the ^bella menzogna~ [beautiful lie] that represents a
kind of poetry, as in ^Conv~. II.i.3).  Next we come upon the term
^visione~ (see ^Par~. XXXIII.62), a kind of writing distinguished by
being (or by claiming to be) literally true.  This lofty word has
barely ceased resonating when Dante descends the stylistic ladder to
perhaps the lowest level of the vernacular that we encounter in this
canticle, ^grattar dov' @e la rogna~ (scratch where it itches).  In
three lines he puts forward what the poem is not (a tissue of lies, a
"mere" fiction), what it is (an inspired vision), and what style its
author insists that he employs (the comic, or low vernacular, style).
See the notes to ^Inferno~ XX.1-3, XX.106-114, and XX.130; ^Purgatorio~
IX.34-42 and XXX.21; ^Paradiso~ I.20-21.

	|127.~  The phrase "rimossa ogne menzogna" may reflect St. Paul's
"Propter quod deponentes mendacium, loquimini veritatem" (Therefore,
having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth --
Ephesians 4:25).  See Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the
^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001), p. 78.

	|130-132.~  While few of the commentators suggest a source for this
tercet, Pietro di Dante is a rare early exception (comm. to vv. 127-132
[only in his first redaction]).  He cites, after various other
potential sources, the text that alone has had a "career" among Dante's
commentators to this passage, Boethius (^Cons. Phil~. III.1[pr]), a
citation only recurring nearly five centuries later in Campi (comm. to
this tercet).  In the first half of the twentieth century it is found
in Grandgent (comm. to this tercet) and in Scartazzini/Vandelli (comm.
to verse 132).  Porena (comm. to verse 132) also cites it, but sees a
possible problem with its pertinence to Dante's context.  However, it
currently enjoys a certain stability, finding its way to most recent
commentaries.  Boethius's text reads: "Talia sunt quae restant, ut
degustata quidem mordeant, interius autem recepta dulcescant" (You will
find what I have yet to say bitter to the taste, but, once you have
digested it, it will seem sweet [tr. R. Green]).  However, there is no
instance of a commentator referring to a biblical text (a close
neighbor of one that may have been on Dante's mind only shortly before
[see the note to vv. 91-93]), one found in John's Revelation (Apoc.
10:9 [repeated nearly verbatim in 10:10]), where the angel is
addressing the Apostle: "Accipe librum, et devora illum: et faciet
amaricari ventrem tuum, sed in ore tuo erit dulce tanquam mel" (Take
the book and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your
mouth it will be sweet as honey).

It is a cause of some curiosity to find in Jacopo della Lana's gloss to
these lines (comm. to vv. 130-132) an apparent trace of ^Epistle~
XIII.27: "Forma sive modus tractandi est ^poeticus~, ^fictivus~,
descriptivus, digressivus, transumptivus, et cum hoc diffinitivus,
divisivus, probativus, improbativus, et ^exemplorum positivus~"
(italics added).  See Jacopo's explanation that those who chew on
Dante's words will find his speech "poetico e fittivo e di esempli
fingitivo" (poetic and fictive and putting forth examples).  For
discussion of Jacopo's apparent dependence on the ^Epistle~, see
Hollander (^Dante's Epistle to Cangrande~ [Ann Arbor: University of
Michigan Press, 1993], pp. 98-99).

	|133-142.~  Cacciaguida's concluding ten lines (and he will speak only
nine more as he leaves the poem in the next canto, vv. 28-36)
establish, if not the ^ars poetica~ of this poem, then its mode of
employing ^exempla~ for our moral instruction.  This passage has caused
no little confusion, especially three elements contained in it.  (1)
Some commentators seem to assume that it is only concerned with those
in Hell; (2) others think that the poem ennobles its subjects (rather
than the obverse); and (3) still others object that not all the
populace of the afterworld seen by Dante may be considered famous.  The
first two problems are easily dealt with, for it is obvious that the
poet means to indicate the famous dead in all three canticles and also
that the honor accrues to the poem (one that eschews the commonplace
for the extraordinary) rather than to its subjects.  As for the third,
one example of this complaint will suffice.  Singleton (comm. to verse
138) argues that this claim cannot be taken as literally true, since
there are many "unknown characters" found in the cast of the ^Comedy~.
"One has only to think," he says, "of the riff-raff, generally, of the
eighth circle of ^Inferno~."  However, those crowds of "extras" do not
count in Dante's scheme of things; those who are ^named~ are famous (or
were, in Dante's time at least, better known than they are in ours).

There is one other problem of literal understanding that is as present
today as it has always been, perhaps because it has never been treated,
since readers do not see that it is problematic and simply assume that
they understand what is meant.  The word ^cima~ can mean various things
(see the note to ^Purg~. XI.91-93), but here it refers either to
mountaintops (as we believe it does) or treetops (as it apparently does
for most readers).  The general sense is clear enough: Exemplary
figures and clear arguments are both required to convince a reader.

	|133-134.~  The metaphors and similetic comparisons (the poem is a
"cry," equated with the wind; its human subjects, metaphorically
mountain peaks [or, according to not a few, treetops]) now make the
poem lofty, that is, "tragic" in its stylistic reach.  See the note to
vv. 127-129.  If there the author insisted on the comic essence of his
work, he now insists equally vehemently on its tragic (or stylistically
lofty) dimension.

	|139.~  The reader notes that Dante does not here imagine people
reading his poem, but hearing it being read.

	|142.~  The poet surely forgets what he has ^not~ said at vv. 92-93.
If ever there existed a "proof that remains obscure," that lacuna
qualifies.

This canto, with its lavish praise of Cangrande, may be thought of as
Dante's farewell to Verona, written between 1317 and 1318 according to
Giorgio Petrocchi ("Canto XVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], pp.
335, 337).  For the question, still somewhat vexed, of the exact date
of Dante's arrival in Ravenna (we assume soon after he left Verona),
see Eugenio Chiarini, "Ravenna," ^ED~ (IV [1973]), pp. 861-64.
