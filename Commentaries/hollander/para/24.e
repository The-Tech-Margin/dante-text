	|1-9.~	Beatrice apostrophizes the heavenly host (minus Christ
and Mary, who have now both ascended to the Empyrean) on behalf of Dante.
She hopes that they will share their "meal," as it were, with her pupil.
It would seem, given the reference to St. Peter in the last four verses of
the preceding canto and given the phrase in the first verse of this one,
"sodalizio eletto a la gran cena" (a fairly evident allusion to the Last
Supper), that Beatrice, while not forgetting all who are now 'seated'
at that 'meal,' addresses herself in particular to the twelve apostles,
three of whom take a major role in the cantos in the heaven of the fixed
stars, XXIII-XXVII.

This is one of the three cantos (of the thirty-three in which she might
have done so, ^Purg~. XXXI through ^Par~. XXX) in which she speaks the
opening lines.  See also ^Purgatorio~ XXXI and ^Paradiso~ V.

For this and other examples of the "metaphorical density" of this
canto, so often attacked for its poetic poverty, see Pietro De Marchi
("Canto XXIV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 380-82),
with a table indicating some twenty areas of human activity into which
Dante here dips his pen.

	|1.~  This verse/tercet is made up of "loaded" terms, the first
of which is ^sodalizio~: Jacopo della Lana says there are four kinds of
fellowship: in battle, "compagni"; on voyages, "comiti"; in business:
"colleghi"; at table, "sodali."  For a likely "source" for Dante's choice
of the word ^eletto~, see Matthew 22:14: "Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci
vero ^electi~" (For many are called, but few are chosen).  For the phrase
^la gran cena~, see the Book of Revelation (Apoc.  19.9): "Beati qui ad
^coenam~ nuptiarum agni vocati sunt" (Blessed are they who are called
to the marriage supper of the Lamb) and Luke (14.16): ^"coenam magnam"~
(great banquet).  See Benvenuto (comm. vv. 1-3): <Ad primum veniens dico,
quod autor describit orationem Beatricis ad collegium apostolorum, in
qua primo facit exordium ad captandam benevolentiam, dicens: O sodalizio,
idest, o consortium apostolorum; nam sodalis proprie est socius in mensa;
unde dicit: eletto alla gran cena, idest, ad coenam Domini in die Jovis
sancti, et per consequens ad coenam aeternam, del benedetto Agnello,
scilicet, Christi, qui agnus immaculatus immolatus est pro salute nostra>.

	|4.~  The verb ^prelibare~ (to have a foretaste) is a striking one.  We
have seen it once before (at ^Par.~ X.23).  It has also been used in
^De vulgari~ (I.iv.5) and in Dante's ^Epistles~ (VI.24).  All these
occurrences are recorded in the entry "prelibare" by Antonio Lanci in
the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~ (^ED~ IV [1971]), which, however, omits the
two occurrences in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~ (XIII.42 and XIII.46).
Its use here may remind us of its presence there, where it indicates
the opening passage of the ^cantica~, the foretaste of (or prologue to)
what is coming.

	|5.~  For the crumbs of bread that fall from the banquet of philosophy,
see ^Convivio~ I.i.10; is this a correction of that passage,
substituting a better "meal," communion in Christ, for the one
portrayed there?  For the last canticle as the "completed ^Convivio~,"
see the note to ^Paradiso~ III.91-96.

	|6.~  The line may be construed "before death appoint him his time" or
"before time appoint him his death."  Grammar makes both possible; the
commentators, however, seem sure of the first reading.

	|8.~  For this image, see ^Aeneid~ VI.230, ^rore levi~ (light dew), as
was first suggested by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 7-9).

	|9.~  The commentators take the "source" variously, whether divine
grace, eternal life, God's thoughts, or divine truth.

	|10-12.~  These souls whirl, upon a central point, in circles.  They
look like comets because they have tails of light; however, they
apparently maintain their circular orbits, that is, are not errant in
their motions, as actual comets are.

	|13-18.~  The simile clarifies the motion of these "comets."  Like the
flywheels of a mechanical clock, some move more quickly than others;
however, here greater speed is the mark of greater worthiness, as we
learn from vv. 19-21.

Among the earlier commentators, only John of Serravalle (comm. to these
verses) perceives and expresses the precise resemblance between the
simile's tenor and vehicle.  For him the circling groups of dancers and
the flywheels are precisely related in their varying grades of joy,
their greater and lesser speeds revealing their relative degrees of
blessedness.  He does not go on to observe, and nearly five centuries
would pass until Poletto would do so (comm. to these verses), that,
since we are seeing the Church Militant, the circles that we are
observing here might well be the circles we observe there (in Canto
XXXII), that is, the "rows" in the round "amphitheater" of the Rose.
In that case, all those who seem to believe that this circle contains
only apostles need to revise their opinion.  The highest tier of the
Rose contains Mary (^Par~. XXXII.1); John the Baptist (XXXII.31); Adam,
Peter, John (as scribe of the Apocalypse), Moses, Anna, and Lucy (all
referred to in XXXII.118-137).  All of these, we must assume, are in
that circling dance from which issues Peter now, and James and John in
the next canto.  Are all the apostles in this rank?  Dante does not
choose to tell us.  We probably should not assume that they are, as do
the commentators who, reading that three of them are in this group, go
on, quite reasonably (or so it must have appeared to them) to assume
that the twelve apostles are here -- and are the only ones here.  Both
of these may well be false deductions.  Three apostles do not a dozen
make.  We are surely encouraged (as was Poletto) to believe that Dante
thought that souls other than apostles are in this circle (very likely
a correct view); however, it is not clear that no other apostles are in
it (this last would seem a more dubious proposition; e.g., would not
Dante have included, e.g., Matthew, Mark, and Luke?).  It is difficult
to understand why Poletto's understanding of these verses has not
entered the discussion of them, which remains, as a result, maddeningly
vague.  See Hollander ("^Paradiso~ 24.13-21: St. Peter's Companions,"
^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [May 2006]).
Now, and for a more "apostolic" view, see the notes to ^Par.~ XXIII.130-135
and to vv. 1-9 and v. 1, above.

For a much earlier listing, which also refers to the population of the
top tier of the Rose, see the note to ^Paradiso~ IV.29-30.  In those
lines we learn that Moses, both Johns, Mary, and Samuel are probably
there; the first four are indeed confirmed as being in the highest row
by the text of ^Paradiso~ XXXII.

Tozer (comm. to vv. 13-15): "A simile of the same kind, derived from
the works of clocks, is found in ^Paradiso~ X.139-42, only there it is
the striking apparatus which is spoken of.  ^Il primo~: the innermost,
while ^l'ultimo~ is the outermost.  In comparison of the rapid motion
of the outer wheel the inner wheel appears to be at rest."

	|16.~  The word ^carola~ (lit. "carol") here refers to a style of
dancing.  See Aulo Greco ("Il canto XXIV del ^Paradiso~," ^Nuove
letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], pp. 112-13)
for the distinction between a ^danza~ (dance) and a ^carola~ (reel), in
which dancers in circles or in straight lines hand each other off to a
next (temporary) partner.  But see Landino (comm. to vv. 16-18) for the
most economical explanation: "Chos@i quelle carole, ^idest~ anime che
si giravono; proprio carola che significa ballo tondo, ^differentemente
danzando~, et per questa differentia dimostra pi@u et meno beatitudine,
et per@o dice ^mi si faceano stimare veloci et lente~ della sua
richeza" (Thus were these "carols," i.e., souls, turning.  "Carol"
signifies "round dance."  "Moving to a different measure" in such a way
as to reveal more and less beatitude; and therefore [the poet] says
"made me gauge their gladness" by its wealth [italics added]).

However, one may want to consider that two of the early commentators,
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 13-18) and his "pupil," John of Serravalle
(comm. to vv. 13-18), refer to ^carola~ as indicating a ^vas~ or
^vasello~ (vase, vessel) used by ladies to store precious items
(Benvenuto mentions spoons; John, jewels).

The enjambement of the adverb "differente-mente" surely calls attention
to the poet's hand.  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 16-18) refers to the adverb
"caninamente" of ^Inferno~ VI.14, as does Campi (comm. to vv. 16-18),
who suggests that both are not so much adverbs as adjective and noun
used as in a Latin ablative absolute, and thus written ^canina mente~
and ^differente mente~.

	|19-21.~  From among the "dancers" and from the group of them that was
most joyful, evidently the one that includes the apostles, came a
"flame" that was as bright as any other there.  We perhaps need to be
reminded that Dante is beholding the Church Triumphant, minus Jesus and
Mary.  When we examine the inhabitants of the Rose (^Par~. XXXII.118),
we will see that the only two apostles mentioned there (Peter and John)
are in the highest rank in that great stadium.  Their situation here
lends support to those who believe that the group set apart here is
also apostolic.  But see the note to vv. 13-18.

	|19.~  The dancer who is most precious ("of greater value") is St.
Peter; he will not be named until Canto XXV.12.  For the second
appearance of the noun ^carezza~, see ^Paradiso~ XXV.33.

	|20-21.~  Peter's higher worth among even such exalted company as this
is indicated by his greater brightness.

	|22.~  Peter circles Beatrice three times, as he will do again at the
end of the canto (verse 152), on that occasion circling Dante.  This
number, that of the Trinity, is obviously auspicious.  (Some later
commentators see it as the number of the three theological virtues;
since Peter appears here as the representative of only one, Faith, that
would seem a less likely reference here.)  However, and as other
passages will remind us, it is also the number of times Peter betrays
Jesus (see Matthew 26:34, 26:75; Mark 14:30, 14:72; Luke 22:34, 22:61).
 This might not be a case convincingly made on the basis of this verse
alone; but see the note to vv. 124-126.

	|24.~  The ^fantasia~, the image-receiving capacity of the brain,
receives sounds as well, as this passage makes clear.

	|25.~  The familiar image of Dante as scribe is before us again, but
now in non-forthcoming mode.  His ^dictator~ (his phantasy) cannot
bring Peter's song of affection for Beatrice back to mind, and so his
pen must omit it.

	|26.~  Daniello (comm. to vv. 22-27) is apparently the only reader of
this canto to think of the context offered this scene by the weaving
contest between Athena and Arachne.  He does so in order to place the
painterly technique (the representation of folds in a garment) referred
to here in an Ovidian context (^Metam~. VI.61-66).  Jacopo della Lana
(comm. to vv. 26-27) was the first to make the now common observation
that this verse describes the way a painter would depict the folds in a
garment, by using darker colors for them.

	|27-30.~  Dante laments the coarseness of the art of his time (his own
included), which is simply not up to the challenge of representing such
delicate shadings, whether visually or verbally.  What he does
reproduce is what Peter says to Beatrice, i.e., the words that he
speaks after he has stopped singing.  She, he reports, has loosed him
from the sphere he was circling in (see verse 11) and he, as a result,
may serve as Dante's interlocutor.

	|31-33.~  And now Dante does reassume his role as scribe, setting down
the words that Peter uttered after he had finished his (unrecorded)
song.  No other section of the poem has more uses of the noun for
"breath," ^spiro~, and the verb for "inspire" or "breathe into,"
^spirare~ (^Par~. XXIII.104, XXIV.82, XXV.82, XXV.132, XXVI.3,
XXVI.103).  The self-consciousness of these lines is telling: Peter,
inspired (the word the poet uses for his breath, ^spiro~, is nearly
surely intended to remind us of the spiration of the Holy Spirit),
utters words that Dante, his scribe, can tell us (and just has).  See
the notes to ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.55-63 and ^Paradiso~ VI.88.

	|34-36.~  From this tercet we realize that the "everlasting light" (we
remember that this light was the most brilliant among its companions in
the Church Triumphant at verse 21) addressed by Beatrice is St. Peter.
For Jesus left the "keys of the kingdom" (Matthew 16:19) to Peter.  In
the tradition of Roman Catholicism, this signified that Jesus picked
him to be the first pope, presiding over, among other things, the
departure of the saved and damned souls for the afterlife.

	|37-38.~  Beatrice invites Peter to examine Dante on the theological
virtue Faith, both its major tenets and its lesser aspects.  For the
word ^tenta~, see the note to verse 48.

	|39.~  Peter's walking on water displayed his faith in Jesus, but also
revealed the tenuous nature of that faith when he doubts and begins to
sink, causing Jesus to castigate him: "O you of little faith" (Matthew
14.28-33).  And so here Beatrice is remembering Peter's noble beginning
and suppressing reference to the far less impressive conclusion of the
biblical narrative.  See the note to vv. 124-126.

	|40-45.~  Beatrice concludes her intervention on Dante's behalf by
acknowledging that Peter already knows that her pupil passes muster on
the three theological virtues.  On the other hand, it is Dante's
responsibility to glorify these, most of all Faith.

	|40.~  The three verbs of this verse obviously reflect the three
theological virtues, Love, Hope, and Faith, in that order, as was
apparent from the very beginning of the commentary tradition (see
Jacopo della Lana on this verse).

	|46-51.~  The medieval bachelor's examination in theology, some
elements of which still persist in oral doctoral examinations in a few
fields at a few institutions in our day, is rehearsed here.  A bachelor
was a candidate for the first degree in the field, just as today.  The
examination was administered by a ^magister~ (master); he certified the
bachelor as being worthy of entering the pursuit of the doctorate in
theology, probably his own goal as well.

	|46.~  A quarter of a century ago Alex Sheers, in a seminar at
Princeton, suggested that the language here sounded Pauline.  See
Ephesians 6:16: ^scutum fidei~ (the shield of faith); I Thessalonians
5:8: ^loricam fidei et caritatis~ (the breastplate of faith and love);
I Timothy 6:12: ^certamen fidei~ (the good fight of faith).  And now,
for a similar examination of some possible Pauline sources, see
Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 110.

	|48.~  The ^magister~ intervenes, not to settle the question
(^quaestio~, a formal exercise in debate in which the answer is known
or assumed), but to formulate it - as Peter is about to do.

See Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 47-48) for a full discussion of the
dispute that has followed this verse through the centuries.  And see
Tozer's explanation (comm. to vv. 46-48): "The allusion here is to what
took place in the mediaeval Universities.  The 'Master' is a duly
licensed teacher, and the Bachelor a student who is preparing for the
office of teacher.  The Bachelor at one stage of his preparatory course
was required to pass through a form of examination, which was called
'Disputatio tentativa,' before a Master, who propounded the subject of
this (^la question~).  Usually in such cases a number of opponents were
appointed to combat the candidate's arguments (see Rashdall, ^The
Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages~, vol. I., p. 466).  In the
present instance, however, this is not supposed to happen, and the
proofs advanced lead up to a conclusion which is recognized as well
established, so that the candidate has no need [to] ^terminar la
questione~.  Similarly, St. Peter propounds the question, and Dante
adduces what he considers to be the fitting arguments, but the
conclusion is determined beforehand.  The title 'disputatio tentativa'
is probably referred to in the word ^tenta~ in l. 37."

	|52-111.~  Tozer (comm. to these verses) divides the ensuing
"examination" into five parts, as follows: "The subjects of the
questions and answers in what follows are: (1) what faith is (ll.
52-66); (2) how Dante understands St. Paul's definition of faith (ll.
67-82); (3) whether Dante possesses faith (ll. 83-87); (4) whence he
derived his faith (ll. 88-96); (5) what is the evidence of the
inspiration of Scripture, on which he bases his faith (ll. 97-111)."

	|52-57.~  Dante turns to Peter and then to Beatrice, who signals that
he should, in metaphor, "pour forth the waters" of his answer.  As
Grandgent was apparently the first to notice (comm. to verse 57), the
passage is possibly a calque on Christ's words (John 7:38: "He who
believes in me, as the Scripture says, 'From within him there shall
flow rivers of living water'").  It is interesting that here, as later
(vv. 64-65, when he will turn to Paul for the definition of Faith),
Dante never uses the words of his examiner to define this theological
virtue.  It is all very well to explain (as does Carroll [comm. to vv.
52-66]) that Peter never offered a definition of it, with the result
that Dante had, therefore, to resort to St. Paul.  The question then
remains (in addition to the nagging question of Paul's absence from the
cast of characters who perform a part in the poem), why did Dante
choose to give Peter so prominent a role with regard to Faith?  And,
for the question of Paul's importance to Dante, see the last items in
the note to ^Inferno~ XXXI.67.

For an interesting hypothesis, suggesting that the puzzling reference
to the "phoenix" in a sonnet of Cino da Pistoia, "Infra gli altri
diffetti del libello," is put forward as an angry response to Dante's
omission of Paul from the citizenry of Paradise (as described in ^Par~.
XXXII), see Fabian Alfie ("Re-reading the Phoenix: An Interpretation of
Cino da Pistoia's 'Infra gli altri diffetti del libello,'" ^Italian
Culture~ 21 [2003]: 11-14).  Alfie agrees with those students of Cino
who argue that this sonnet is authentic, against those who, for what
tend to be spurious reasons, want to keep it separate from his
authentic production.  He also quite correctly reasons that the
supposed reference of the "phoenix" to Cino's poetic lady friend
Selvaggia makes little sense, not least because Selvaggia only died in
1306, and thus could not have yet been in Heaven to be seen by Dante.

	|56-57.~  Cf. ^Inferno~ I.79-80: "Or se' tu quel Virgilio e quella
^fonte~ / che ^spandi~ di parlar s@i largo fiume?" (Are you then
Virgil, the fountainhead / that pours so full a stream of speech?).
Consultation of the DDP reveals that apparently no one has seen what
seems a fairly obvious self-citation, perhaps because it would seem to
have Beatrice promote Dante to Virgil's status, making him, and not the
Latin poet, a "source" or "fountainhead"; nonetheless, that is
approximately what has transpired within the narrative.

	|58-60.~  While this tercet would qualify, formally, as a true
invocation, it is uttered by the protagonist rather than by the poet,
and thus falls outside the set of nine authorial invocations (see the
note to ^Inf~. II.7-9); cf. Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~
[Ravenna: Longo, 2002]), p. 32n.

	|59.~   "Centurion," our translation, is the generic term; Dante,
however, uses a word that needs some explanation.  Peter is presented
as the ^primipilus~ among "Christian soldiers."  The term refers to the
standard-bearer in the Roman army who throws the first javelin ^(primum
pilum)~ in battle.  Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 58-60) was the
first to say that the word was found in Isidore of Seville; he has been
followed by several later commentators (e.g., Campi [comm. to vv.
58-60], Torraca [comm. to vv. 58-60], Scartazzini/Vandelli [comm. to
vv. 58-59], Pietrobono [comm. to this verse], Sapegno [comm. to vv.
58-60], Mattalia [comm. to this verse]).  However, none offers a
specific textual location for the description; furthermore,
consultation of the ^Etymologies~ does not reveal any even promising
leads.  (Daniello [comm. to vv. 58-60] indicates a possible source in
the Roman miltary historian Vegetius [cited by Dante in ^Mon~.
II.ix.3], in particular ^De re militari~ II.viii.)

	|61.~  Dante's claim for the trustworthiness of even the writing
instruments of sacred texts, clear from the phrase "the truthful pen,"
reflects his concern for that basic distinction between two kinds of
writing, truthful and fabulous (i.e., historical and fictive), that
runs from one end of the ^Commedia~ to the other.

	|62-63.~  Dante's locution necessarily calls attention to the fact that
Peter did not in fact write about faith, a task that he left for Paul.
See the notes to vv. 52-57 and to vv. 124-126.

	|64-66.~  As Paul said (Hebrews 11:1): "Faith is the substance of
things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen -- that is its
quiddity."  Aulo Greco ("Il canto XXIV del ^Paradiso~," ^Nuove letture
dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], p. 120) reports that
Aquinas, in his ^De fide~, says that it is in fact the best definition
of this theological virtue.

We should remember that Hebrews 11:4-40 recounts the salvations, by
their faith in Christ to come, of major Hebrew figures, from Abel to
Samuel.

	|67-69.~  Peter challenges Dante to explicate Paul's words, and
especially the related concepts of faith as the "substance" of hope and
the "evidence" for things not seeable.

	|70-78.~  Tozer (comm. to these verses) translates the protagonist's
thoughts as follows: "Heavenly mysteries cannot be known on earth by
sight, but are discerned by faith only; and as hope is founded on this,
faith is the substance, or foundation, of things hoped for.  It is also
the proof of things unseen, because we are justified in arguing from
faith in matters where sight is unavailing."

	|75.~  Dante's ^intenza~ translates the Scholastic term ^intentio~
(notion, concept).  And so the thought is (Grandgent [comm. to this
verse]) "assumes the concept," that is, "falls into the category."

	|78.~  Giuseppe Mazzotta ("Dante and the Virtues of Exile," ^Poetics
Today~ 5 [1984]: 663) points to Hebrews 11.1 for the word "argomento"
[evidence].  Since this is the third occurrence of that term in
fourteen lines, with the first being its presence in the citation of
Paul that the protagonist uses in verse 65 as part of his definition of
Faith, that ascription seems beyond dispute.

	|79-85.~  Peter approves Dante's intellectual grasp of the doctrinal
aspect of faith; now he wants to know if his pupil really has it, or is
only talking a good game, like the sophist Dante seems to have
convinced him he is not.

	|89-96.~  To Peter's question about the source of his faith, Dante
responds, "The rain of the Holy Spirit poured over the two testaments
is the syllogism of syllogisms."

	|97-102.~  Peter's follow-up question, in which he asks why the
protagonist considers Scripture inspired, elicits Dante's avowal that
nature cannot have been responsible for the miracles recounted in both
testaments.

	|103-105.~  Peter persists in his testing of Dante's faith, asking
whether it might be true that the argument from miracles is not
verifiable, that is, that such argument is based on the truth of the
proposition that is being tested.  (We may reflect that the obvious
subtext here, for a Christian discussant, is the resurrection of Jesus.)

	|106-110.~  Tozer (comm. to these verses) paraphrases Dante's rejoinder
as follows: "The reply to such an objection is that the conversion of
the world to Christianity without miracles by men of no position like
the Apostles would be incomparably the greatest of all miracles, and
would be in itself a sufficient proof of the divine origin of
Christianity."  See Augustine, the final words of the fifth chapter ^De
civitate Dei~ XXII: "[O]ne grand miracle suffices for us, that the
whole world has believed without any miracles" (tr. M. Dods).

	|108.~  For the word ^centesmo~, see Matthew 19:29 (another passage in
which the authority of Peter may seem challenged; see the note to vv.
124-126): "And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or
father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive
^a hundredfold~ and will inherit eternal life."  It was Peter's
troubling question (what shall he and the other disciples have for
giving up the things of this world to follow Jesus) that elicited that
remark.

	|111.~  Gratuitous in terms of the argument being made (but thoroughly
in keeping with what we expect from Dante) is this biting thrust at the
Church, corrupted under (and, in some cases, by) Peter's successors.
For a survey of saved and damned popes, see the note to ^Inferno~
VII.46-48.

	|113-114.~  "Dio laudamo" is of course the Italian version of the Latin
hymn ^Te Deum laudamus~, which we heard intoned in ^Purgatorio~ IX.140,
when the gate of Purgatory swung open (see the note to ^Purg~.
IX.139-145).  And see Gino Casagrande ("'I s'appellava in terra il
sommo bene' [^Paradiso~, XXVI, 134]," ^Aevum~ 50 [1976], pp. 260-64)
for the relationship between all the Italian hymns of praise in the
eighth heaven and the Hebrew word of praise "alleluia."  See also Kevin
Brownlee ("Why the Angels Speak Italian: Dante as Vernacular ^Poeta~ in
^Paradiso~ XXV," ^Poetics Today~ 5 [1984]: 597-610) for reflections on
that subject.

There is a profusion of hymns in this heaven: ^Paradiso~ XXIII.128
^(Regina celi)~; XXV.73 ("Sperino in te"); XXV.98 ^(Sperent in te)~;
XXVI.69 ("Santo, santo, santo"); XXVII.1 ("Al Padre, al Figlio, a lo
Spirito Santo, ^gloria~"), including this one, six musical outbursts in
all.

It is curious that the commentary tradition is silent on the fact that
the ^Te Deum~ is represented as being sung in the vernacular, surely
connected to the Italian identity of the poet/bachelor of theology who
has just concluded the crucial part of his "examination" here.
Further, the commentators, without dispute among themselves, either
think that the outburst of the Church Triumphant celebrates Dante's
profession of faith ^or~ the triumph of the Christian faithful.
Scartazzini/Vandelli (comm. to these verses) were the first to suggest
that possibly both are intended, as Momigliano (comm. to these verses)
concurs.

	|115-123.~  Although verse 121 makes it plain that Peter has accepted
Dante's profession of faith, it is also clear that he wants the new
professor to expatiate on two points (they correspond to his first and
fourth questions and Dante's responses [vv. 52-53 and 61-66; and then
vv. 89-96]).  Peter wants Dante to spell out precisely ^what~ he
believes and exactly ^where~ he learned it.

	|115.~  Peter's baronial title will be given to James as well (see
^Par~. XXV.17).  It probably reflects its use as the term of address
for a feudal lord, as Mestica observes (comm. to vv. 115-117).
Daniello (comm. to vv. 115-117) ties the poet's use of this term to his
previous (in ^Par~. XXIV.59) use of the term ^primipilo~.  Lombardi
(comm. to vv. 115-117) reports that it was not uncommon in the late
medieval period to give saints the titles of those who were indeed
powerful in this world.  One example (of the two) he adduces is
Giovanni Boccaccio's (repeated) reference to "baron messer santo
Antonio" (^Decameron~ VI.x.9, VI.x.11, VI.x.44).

	|118.~  See Tozer (comm. to this verse): "^Donneare~ is from Proven$cal
^domnear~, and that from Lat. ^domina~; it expresses the chivalrous
treatment of a lady by her cavalier.  Here it is used of the grace of
God gently operating on the mind of man."

	|124-138.~  Dante's seventh response involves the experience of Peter
and John at Christ's tomb (see John 20:3-8); Dante's ^credo~ in God the
Creator; his proofs: philosophical, theological, and Scriptural (from
Genesis to Peter's Epistles).

	|124-126.~  Here is a part of Carroll's comment to vv. 115-138: "That
is, Peter ^sees~ now the risen body of Christ, concerning which he had
only ^faith~ as he ran to the sepulchre; but even faith made him
conquer the younger feet of John, who at the time had no faith in the
Resurrection.  The difficulty is that it was John who outran Peter and
came first to the sepulchre.  It is not in the least likely that Dante
forgot this.  His meaning undoubtedly is that while the younger feet,
through lack of faith, lingered at the entrance, Peter's faith carried
him past his doubting companion to the inside.  (In ^De Mon.~ III.ix,
however, the incident is given as an instance of Peter's impulsiveness
rather than his faith: 'John says that he went in immediately when he
came to the tomb, seeing the other disciple lingering at the entrance.'
 Perhaps Dante wished to retract his former judgment.)  This does no
injustice to John, since he himself says it was only after he entered
and saw how the grave-clothes were folded up, that he believed (John
20:5-8).  It is somewhat strange, however, that Dante should choose
this incident as an example of Peter's faith."

Is this more than a slight dig in the ribs for Peter?  See the notes to
vv. 22, 39, 52-57, 62-63, and 108.  The reader would do well to turn
immediately to ^Monarchia~ III.ix.1-19, a diatribe against Peter ^as a
stand-in for the papacy~.  Discussing the context of the passage in
Luke 22:38, which was among the biblical texts that the hierocrats
employed to assert papal authority over the emperor, Dante has this to
say about Peter's intellectual capacity: "Peter, as was his habit,
answered unreflectingly, only considering the surface of things"
(^Mon~. III.ix.2); later (III.ix.8) he adds that, had Peter actually
said what the hierocrats claimed he did, Christ would have reproached
him for that remark about the two swords "as He did reproach him many
times, when he replied not knowing what he was saying."  Dante
continues in a similar vein (III.ix.9): "And that Peter was in the
habit of speaking without reflecting is proved by his hasty and
unthinking impulsiveness, which came not just from the sincerity of his
faith, but, I think, from his simple and ingenuous nature."  Finally,
having listed a whole series of Peter's inadequacies, both as thinker
and as loyal follower of Jesus, Dante moves toward his conclusion: "It
is helpful to have listed these episodes involving our Archimandrite in
praise of his ingenuousness, for they show quite clearly that when he
spoke of the two swords he was answering Christ with no deeper meaning
in mind" (all these translations are from P. Shaw's edition).
According to Carroll, this passage may serve as a partial retraction of
those views.  The reader has, nonetheless, to wonder why Dante should,
if more circumspectly than in the anti-Petrine diatribe in ^Monarchia~,
be chipping away at the veneer of authority lodged in the man whom he
considered the first pope.  Is it possible that his widely represented
distrust of particular popes prompts him to protest any emerging sense
that a pontiff, because of his tenure in the highest ecclesiastical
office, is necessarily without doctrinal error?  See Bennassuti's
unintentionally amusing insistence (comm. to ^Inf~. XI.8) that Dante
could not have condemned Pope Anastasius II as a heretic because the
poet believed in papal infallibility (Bennassuti, as a priest, should
have known better, since this did not become a doctrine of the Church
until his own nineteenth century); as a result the reader is to
understand that demons put that inscription on the tomb for Dante to
read.  This is perhaps one of the most extravagant misreadings of the
text of the poem and of Dante's intentions in a commentary tradition
that is not deprived of amusingly wrongheaded insistence on what Dante
supposedly would never do.

	|130-132.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) interpret what has
proven to be a surprisingly controversial line as having two focal
points, the love on God's part for His creation, the love on its part
for Him.  We have followed them in our translation.

Italo Borzi ("Il Canto XXIV," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-'81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 660) wonders
whether Dante's insistent affirmation of his orthodoxy in matters of
faith might not reveal an anxiety on his part lest his detractors have
influenced his readers to consider him a heretic.

	|134.~  For Dante's distinction between physics and metaphysics here
(and the relation of this passage to discussions found in ^Convivio~
II), see Alfonso Maier@u ("Dante di fronte alla Fisica e alla
Metafisica," in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence:
Cesati, 2004], pp. 127-49), especially his concluding remarks.

	|136.~  This verse repeats, nearly verbatim, Luke 24:44, as was pointed
out by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 136-138).  Jesus speaks: "These are my
words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything
written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms
must be fulfilled."

	|137-138.~  See Tozer's paraphrase of these lines: "^voi~, &c.: St.
Peter and the other apostles, who derived the inspiration of their
writings from the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost."

	|139-147.~  Dante recites his ^credo~ in the Trinity.  He goes
on to say that his proofs for God's trinitarian nature are Scriptural,
without specifying where these appear.	Somehow it does not come as
a surprise that Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 143-144) was the first to
offer such a list: Matthew 28:19; John 14:16-17; II Corinthians 13:13;
I Peter 1:2; and I John 5:7.

	|148-150.~  A source for this vehicle of the concluding simile, which
seems to be based on a particular scene as described in some previous
work, has escaped the commentators.  However, see Mario Aversano
(^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent
by the author on 11 September 2001), pp. 113-14, suggesting that two
passages in St. Luke may be conflated in Dante's text, Luke 19:17, and
(somewhat more convincingly) 15:20-32, the parable of the Prodigal Son.
 As Aversano admits, the connections may seem a bit tenuous; however,
as he points out, Dante's gerund ^gratulando~ may pick up Luke's two
uses of ^congratularsi~ in this chapter (15:6 and 15:9), according to
him the only two uses of that verb in the Gospels.  (He has overlooked
one other, also in Luke [1:58].)

	|151-154.~  St. Peter now "laureates" Dante in Faith.  While the phrase
^tre volte~ (three times) occurs on seven other occasions in the poem,
its first and last appearances are the only ones that occur in the
final four verses of a canto, here and in ^Inferno~ XXVI.139.  It would
seem possible that this use remembers ^in bono~ that first occurrence,
in which the ship of Ulysses spins around three times before it sinks.
Here Dante is not being punished for his presumption, but rewarded for
his faith.
