	|1-3.~  If many readers have responded to the previous canto -- for
some the most labored and unwelcoming of the entire poem -- with a
certain impatience (e.g., if ^Paradiso~ is going to be like this, I'd
prefer to spend my time in ^Inferno~ and/or ^Purgatorio~), here they
are placed on notice that, for Dante, Beatrice's instruction in
spiritual astronomy is more aesthetically pleasing than any possible
worldly attraction.  It is notable that each of the verses of this
tercet contains words or phrases that are often associated with sensual
or aesthetic pleasure ^(amor, scald@o il petto, bella, dolce)~, yet
here conjoined with the language of Scholastic argumentation (see the
note to vv. 2-3, below).

	|1.~  It is not surprising, given its Christian valence, that Dante
should have used the Sun as metaphoric equivalent for Beatrice (it is a
nice touch that the professor in the matter pertaining to, in the
phrasing of St. Francis's ^Laudes creaturarum~, "Sister Moon" should be
her "brother," the Sun).

This evident recollection of the first significant events recorded in
the second chapter of the ^Vita nuova~, Beatrice's appearance to the
nearly nine-year-old Dante and his immediate ^innamoramento~, sets the
stage for the entrance of his newly reconstituted instructor and guide
("B,eatrice, dolce guida e cara!" [my sweet beloved guide] of ^Par~.
XXIII.34) to the next 28 cantos.  She will illumine his intellect as
she first stirred all his soul.  Or, as Benvenuto da Imola puts it,
"idest que primo amoravit cor meum carnaliter, deinde mentaliter" [that
is, who first set my heart in carnal affection, then in intellectual
love]).  It is not that she has changed in any way; what has changed is
^his~ ability to comprehend the deeper truths available from her.  Such
a transformation -- from physical to intellectual love -- has roots in
Plato's ^Phaedrus~, surely unknown to Dante by direct encounter, but
perhaps having some influence on him and on others in his time (those
who wrote of the ennobling potential of carnal love) at least from its
diffusion through a lengthy and various tradition (see Joseph A.
Mazzeo, "Dante and the Phaedrus Tradition of Poetic Inspiration," in
^Structure and Thought in the "Paradiso"~ [Ithaca: Cornell University
Press, 1958], pp. 1-24).

	|2-3.~  The development of the opening metaphor (Beatrice as Sun) has
it that the light of his guide illumines the truth behind the conundrum
of the causes of the Moon's dark spots as the light in a lover's eyes
makes beautiful the face of his beloved.  The poet is joining the two
main aspects of his Beatricean versifying, that based on appreciations
of her physical beauty and that dependent upon a spiritual
understanding of a more lasting attraction.  It is jarring, perhaps,
but exhilarating to watch the "old poetry" being conjoined with the
new, the rhymes of carnal love being forced into collaboration with the
language of Scholastic discourse, "provando e riprovando" (by proof and
refutation).  The words clearly refer, in reverse order, to Beatrice's
refutation of Dante's erroneous ideas (^Par~. II.61-105) and to her
truthful assertions (^Par~. II.112-117).  It is a curious fact that
some of Galileo's seventeenth-century followers took up this phrase, in
a patently anti-Scholastic and thus inherently anti-Dantean gesture,
for the motto of the Accademia del Cimento, in Florence, changing its
meaning to "experimenting and then experimenting again," according to
Manfredi Porena (comm. to ^Par~. I.1-3).

	|4-9.~  Dante presents himself as both rebuked and corrected (the terms
relate to ^provando~ and ^riprovando~ in verse 3) in this "confession."
 His previous confession (^Purg.~ XXXI.1-42) involved recanting his
past improper loves.  That this scene marks the beginning, in
^Paradiso~, of what has been described as "the correction of Dante's
intellect" in a program that began with the correction and perfection
of his will ^(Inferno~ and most of ^Purgatorio)~ seems likely (see the
note to ^Purg~. XXVII.139-141).  This process will carry through until
St. Bernard appears and the program of the perfection of Dante's
intellect is begun.

Dante's confession is once again impeded (see ^Purg~. XXXI.7-9).  This
time, however, not through any failing on his part, but because his
attention has been drawn to higher things.  (Further, Beatrice already
knows his thoughts and so expression of them is not necessary.)

This is the first (and only other) time we find the two words
^confessione~ (verse 9) and ^confessare~ (verse 4) together in a canto
since ^Purgatorio~ XXXI (vv. 6 and 38).

	|7.~  What is the precise character of the sight ^(vis,ione)~ appearing
to him?  Is it a dream?  Is it an experience of the noumenal world in a
Pauline face-to-face encounter?  From the prose of the ^Vita nuova
~onward, these have been the two kinds of "visions" that weave their
way through Dante's works.  It would thus seem here that what he is
seeing is actual, not dreamed; and it would further seem that, in
seeing his first saved souls as they are for eternity (if not yet with
their bodies [see ^Par~. XXV.127-129]), he is experiencing a higher
form of vision than he has previously known, gazing on the presence of
two heavenly souls in the very Moon, a collocation that causes, as we
shall see, considerable difficulty in a reader's attempt to comprehend
the ground rules governing the appearances of the saved in the spheres
of the heavens.

	|10-16~.  As though to reward us for having had to deal with his
theologized poetry, Dante now engages us in a pleasing aesthetic moment
(so often associated in the poem with similes, a mode offering Dante
the very stuff of lyric expression).  It is charged with the erotic
energy of thirteenth-century Italian and Proven$cal lyric.  What is
perhaps surprising is the fact that this poet is able to bring that
energy to bear ^here~, in the highest realm.  At the same time, we
should note the way in which he twice in this canto invites us to
carnal impressions of love, only to warn us that these are valuable
only if they are markers of a higher form of affection.  These lines
and the earlier verses that also seem erotically charged (vv. 1-3) look
forward to the stories of two nuns who are delighted to renounce
sexuality.  They also glance back to Beatrice's explanation of the
moonspots.

It takes a lot of confidence in one's own abilities and in one's
audience's answering understanding to write so self-consciously about
such things.

See Freccero's meditation ("Moon Shadows: ^Paradiso~ III," in ^Studies
for Dante: Essays in Honor of Dante Della Terza~, ed. F. Fido ^et al~.
[Fiesole: Cadmo, 1998], pp. 89-101) upon this simile and its
presentation of the optics of transparency and reflection as a means of
discussing some theoretical dimensions of Dante's poetics.

	|17-18.~  The "opposite error" into which Dante falls results from the
fact that, where Narcissus looked into a mirroring surface of water and
thought the beautiful visage he saw in it was that of someone else,
Dante believes that the faces before him are reflections of those who
are now suddenly present alongside of him and Beatrice, not these
actual new beings themselves.  See Bernardino Daniello (comm. to ^Par~.
III.17-18): "...quelle faccie, ch'erano vere, gli paresser false, et a
Narciso la falsa, vera pareva" (those faces, which were real, seemed to
him to be false, while to Narcissus the false seemed real).

For the "Narcissus program" in the poem as a whole (^Inf~. XXX; ^Purg~.
XXX; ^Par~. III, XXX, XXXIII), see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.126-129 and
articles by Brownlee ("Dante and Narcissus [^Purg~. XXX, 76-99],"
^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]: 201-6) and Shoaf (^Dante, Chaucer, and the
Currency of the Word~ [Norman, Oklahoma: Pilgrim Books, 1983], pp.
21-100).  Chiarenza ("The Imageless Vision and Dante's ^Paradiso~,"
^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]: 87-89) speaks of the relevance to this
passage of Hugh of St. Cher's meditation on the nature of St. Paul's
vision of God (II Cor.12:1-4).  Hugh, discussing the differences among
various kinds of vision, speaks of Narcissus's failure to grasp the
nature of the image of himself that he contemplates with such
fascination.

	|19-24.~  Dante, bending his eye on vacancy, allows Beatrice the chance
to get off a good schoolmarmish rebuke of her pupil, whose actions
mirror those of untutored humankind, unable to read the very facts of
human relations -- e.g., who is standing where; who is reflected, who
is not.

	|25-28.~  For Dante's ^puerizia~ and subsequent "childish" behavior,
see ^Purgatorio~ XXX.40-54.  Francesco da Buti's comment to that
passage (comm. to ^Purg~. XXX.37-51) shares elements with his comment
(to vv. 19-33) on this one, which has it that between the ages of one
and seven a male is a child ^(fanciullo)~, while between eight and
fourteen he is a boy ^(garzone)~.  The commentator continues by saying
that Beatrice means to associate her confused pupil with the latter
stage of development.  In the garden of Eden his failings were
portrayed as being based on affectional disorder; here, as is always
the case after his tasting of Lethe and Eunoe (and his moral coming of
age -- belated though it may have been), it is his intellect that is
behaving in a juvenile manner.

	|29-30.~  Dante's misprision has set up Beatrice's explanation, central
to our understanding of the epistemology of the heavenly spheres.  All
whom we meet here are the living souls of real people with real
histories (i.e., they are not part of some "symbolic" or otherwise less
"real" manifestation) and a place in Heaven, i.e., the Empyrean, not
one of the lower spheres, where they manifest themselves to Dante
^only~ on the occasion of his Pauline visit to the heavens.  It is this
last detail to which particular attention must be paid, since later
discussion in this canto might lead one to believe that the souls whom
we meet in the Moon are indeed its permanent residents.  See vv. 49-50,
55-57, 64-66, 73-75, 88-90, 97, and 121-123 (and discussion in the
accompanying notes).  Virgil describes himself, in the only previous
(and only other) use of the verb in the poem (^Purg~. XXI.18), as
situated in the Limbus, which "mi rilega nell'etterno essilio"
(confines me in eternal exile), hardly envisioned as a temporary state.
 (The form "rilegollo" has, by common consent, a different meaning; at
^Inf~. XXV.7, his blasphemous act of freedom required that Vanni Fucci
be bound again.)  But what exactly does ^rilegare~ (or ^relegare~, a
form that shows up in some manuscripts) mean?  Either "relegate" or
"bind fast," according to Andrea Mariani ("rilegare," ^ED~ IV [1973],
p. 929).  And, as Simone Marchesi has suggested in conversation,
whether the form that Dante used was "relegato" or "rilegato," the word
may refer to the Roman punishment of "relegation," the lesser form of
exile (because it was not necessarily permanent).  This description
would surely fit the condition of Piccarda and Constance rather well.

Beatrice's words may easily be understood as verifying that the souls
in the heaven of the Moon are indeed permanently here, as Francesco da
Buti believed (comm. to vv. 19-33): "sono nell'ultimo grado di sotto
(di Dio) in vita eterna" (they are on the last level farthest from God
in the life eternal).  As we move through the relevant passages, it
will be clear that Dante is far from having shut the door on such an
explanation -- but that is precisely what he will do in the next canto
(in ^Par~. IV.28-39).  In consequence, one would be excused for
believing that Beatrice means that Piccarda, Constance, and other
Moon-dwellers are ^rilegate~ (bound, or, as in our translation,
"assigned") here on a permanent basis.  See also the note to ^Paradiso~
IX.119-123.

	|31-33.~  Having potentially undermined the authority of the next
speaker by pointing out that she was one who had broken her vows,
Beatrice quickly restores it in these words that guarantee her ability
to speak God's truth and nothing but that truth.

	|34.~  The use of the word ^ombra~ (shade) to identify a saved soul is
puzzling.  We expect it and find it, amply present, in ^Inferno~ (some
two dozen occurrences) for the damned.  It is surprising to find that
its use to indicate the souls of the dead, now saved, increases in
^Purgatorio~.  While it appears there 49 times in all, it is present
with this meaning 34 times.  Here, in paradise, to see the first saved
soul whom we meet in this ^cantica~ referred to as a "shade" is
disconcerting.  The term that becomes normative in ^Paradiso~ is
^vita~, generally translated "living soul" (^Par~. IX.7; XII.127;
XIV.6; XX.100; XXI.55; XXV.29).  It is perhaps the association of those
present in the first three heavens with flawed activities (broken vows,
ambition, and lust) that moved Dante to begin his descriptions of the
inhabitants of paradise with the word that would surely seem to connect
them with the damned; it is repeated at verse 67, in the plural, to
refer to all the souls found in the Moon.  The souls who appear in
Mercury (^Par~ V.107) will be the next and the last heavenly presences
to be referred to as ^ombre~.

	|35-36.~  The soul whom we meet will shortly (at verse 49) be
identified as Piccarda Donati.  It seems clear from her eagerness to
speak with Dante that we are meant to understand that she has
recognized him from their days in Florence.

Piccarda joins a select few, those personages who appear at the opening
of their respective canticles as the first representative of sin and
then of redemption: Celestine V (if it is indeed he, as seems nearly
certainly to be the case) in ^Inferno~ III, Manfred in the third canto
of ^Purgatorio~, and now Piccarda.  Each of these figures is a
surprise, and was surely meant to be one: a damned pope, a saved
libertine and possible murderer, and a woman who, no matter how
unwilling her subjection to the world, was certainly no St. Clare.

The protagonist's "muddled" condition results, in the opinion of
Manfredi Porena (comm. to verse 36) from his excitement at being able,
for the first time, to speak with a soul who lives in Heaven.

While it is impossible to tell from the text, it would seem that
Piccarda, unlike Beatrice and heavenly souls we meet farther along,
does not read Dante's mind, but needs to have a question spoken in
order to respond (see vv. 91-96).  Dante will also voice questions to
Justinian (^Par~. V.127-129), to Charles Martel (^Par~. VIII.44;
91-93), and to Cunizza (^Par~. IX.19-21).  It is only when he
encounters Folquet of Marseille (^Par~. IX.73-79) that he expects
anyone other than Beatrice to read his thoughts.  This is another
detail setting those who are encountered below the heaven of the Sun
apart from the more exalted souls of Paradise, for Dante never has to
verbalize another question, although Cacciaguida wants to savor his
unnecessary voicing of one (see ^Par~. XV.64-69).

	|37.~  Piccarda is a spirit who is "ben creato" (spirit made for
bliss), in sharp opposition to those in Hell referred to as being "mal
nati" ("ill-born souls" at ^Inf~. XVIII.76; "born for sorrow" at ^Inf~.
XXX.48).

	|41.~  One of Dante's straightforward questions, that concerning the
"lot" of these souls found in the Moon, will turn out to require a more
complex answer than the protagonist probably intended.

	|43-45.~  While there is much that is personal in the interaction
between Dante and Piccarda, her first words show how "impersonal" the
feelings of the saved are, both for one another and for this very
special visitor.  They are more than glad to welcome him, and his
coming increases the love they feel in general (see ^Par~. V.105) by
adding one more soul for them to love.  Nonetheless (with the major
exception of Cacciaguida, whose familial ties to the protagonist are
much [some might say shamelessly] exploited), almost all of the
exchanges between Dante and the blessed show that they are at a
post-personal level of development.  If we keep in mind some of the
great scenes of personal remembrance found in the first two ^cantiche~
(e.g., those presenting Ciacco, Cavalcante, Brunetto, Casella,
Belacqua, and Forese), the starkness of the contrast is evident.

For the view that Piccarda's fate may have represented for Dante "a
variation on the theme of his own exile," see Lansing ("Piccarda and
the Poetics of Paradox: A Reading of ^Paradiso~ III," ^Dante Studies~
105 [1987]: 74).

	|46-49.~  "Piccarda, daughter of Simone Donati, of the celebrated
Florentine family of that name, and sister of Corso and Forese Donati.
Piccarda was a connection by marriage of Dante, he having married
Gemma, daughter of Manetto Donati....  The commentators state that
Piccarda was forced from her convent by her brother Corso, while he was
Podest@a of Bologna (i.e., in 1283 or 1288), in order to marry her to a
Florentine, Rossellino della Tosa, and that she died soon after her
marriage..." (Toynbee [^Concise Dante Dictionary~, "Piccarda"]).

	|47-48.~  It is a "post-Proustian" touch that here the recognition of
things past is not tinged by the tragic sense of mortality, of age that
strips the loveliness from the human form, but rather is complicated by
the souls having become more beautiful, and almost unrecognizable for
that reason.  We may remember what her brother, Forese, said of
Piccarda: "I cannot say whether my sister was more virtuous / than she
was beautiful" (^Purg~. XXIV.13-14).  In her new life she is more of
both.

For the absence of the three Theological Virtues in their perfected
forms in those who display themselves in the sub-solar planets (i.e.,
Moon, Mercury, and Venus), see Ordiway ("In the Earth's Shadow: The
Theological Virtues Marred," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982]: 77-92.).  But
see Carroll's introduction to ^Paradiso~ and ^proem~ to Canto X, for a
much earlier version of this thesis.  And see Andreoli (comm. ^Par~.
III.16): "The fact is that it is only in the fourth heaven that we
shall begin to find souls that are completely without reproach."
Bosco/Reggio rightly point out (comm. ^Par~. XIV.68) that, beginning in
the Sun, the souls who appear take on definite shapes: circle, cross,
eagle, ladder, thus further distinguishing themselves from those who
appear in the first three sub-solar heavens.  And now see Gabriele
Muresu ("Piccarda e la luna [^Par~. III]," ^L'Alighieri~ 26 [2005]:
6-8), on this topic, if without reference to Carroll or Ordiway.

	|49-50.~  Naming herself (and thus answering the first of Dante's
questions), Piccarda for a second time speaks of her placement in this
heaven as though it might be permanent.  See the other relevant
passages indicated in the note to vv. 29-30.

	|51.~  The Moon is "the slowest of these spheres" because, in Dante's
astronomy, each successive heaven, of the nine revolving around the
earth, is moving at a faster rate of speed.  See the apparently
contradictory datum (^Par~. XXVIII.22-39) in which the nine ranks of
angels, each associated with one of the planetary spheres, rotating
around the point that represents the Godhead, rotate faster the
^nearer~ they are to that point.

	|52-54.~  A difficult tercet because it is hard to be certain whether
the ^piacere~ associated with the Holy Spirit is directed by the souls
toward the Spirit or by the Spirit toward the souls.  We are in accord
with that branch of the tradition, a majority, represented by Francesco
da Buti's gloss (to vv. 46-57), in which the souls whom we see in the
Moon "altro desiderio non @anno, se non di piacere allo Spirito Santo
dal quale procede la carit@a" (have no other care except to be pleasing
to the Holy Spirit, from whom holy love comes forth).

For the nature of love represented by the earthly (and now heavenly)
Piccarda, see Lucia Battaglia Ricci ("Piccarda, o della carit@a:
lettura del terzo canto del ^Paradiso~," ^Critica e filologia~ 14
[1989]: 51-65, 68-70), pointing out that Dante is probably relying on
various expressions of mystical devotion, especially those found in the
^Epistula ad Severinum de caritate~ by one "frate Ivo."  For brief
discussion and some bibliography of the "question" of "Brother Ivo"
with relation to Dante's definition of the ^dolce stil novo~, see
Hollander ("Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the ^Comedy~," in ^Dante:
mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario dantesco internazionale,~ ed.
M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence: Cesati, 1999], p. 265n.).

	|55-57.~  The "lot" of these souls reflects their earthly failings (as
will also be true of those we meet in each of the next two heavens),
their failure to maintain the strict sense of their vows.  While this
is a particularly monastic concern, since vows were a part of the
requirements for entrance, as it were, and while the only beings we
hear about here were in fact nuns, the failing is probably not meant to
be understood as being limited to the clergy.

On yet another occasion, the phrasing at the very least admits the
possibility that Piccarda's "lot" ^(sorte)~ is permanently to be
present in the Moon.  See discussions indicated in the note to vv.
29-30.

	|58-63.~  Once again the nature of heavenly transfiguration is alluded
to (see vv. 47-48).  Only after he knows her story can Dante begin to
recognize the features of the earthly woman he once knew.  That even
this much "physicality" is possible is singular; Dante will not
recognize anyone else whom he once knew or is related to and whom he meets in the
various heavens, not Charles Martel (^Par~. VIII), not his ancestor,
Cacciaguida (^Par~. XV).  From this, we may choose to believe that only
here, in the Moon, is there even the slightest amount of physical
resemblance of a soul to its earlier mortal self.  Dante, however, does
not choose to raise (or to answer) this question for us.  But see
^Par~. XXXI.46-48, where St. Bernard tells Dante that the heavenly
infants are recognizable as such.

In 1981, Luisa Saffiotti, a student at Princeton, suggested the
resonance of John 10:3-5 and 10:16, Christ recognized by His disciples
only by His voice.

	|64-66.~  It is clear that the protagonist believes that Piccarda and
the other souls with her are bound in the Moon for eternity unless the
desire he attributes to them to be closer to God should one day be
consummated.  This, of course, is the opinion of the protagonist and is
not necessarily shared by the poet.  See the note to vv. 29-30.

	|67.~  See the discussion of the use of the word ^ombra~ (shade) in
^Paradiso~ (in the note to verse 34).

	|69.~  The exact nature of the love displayed by Piccarda is a subject
for disagreement among the commentators, some arguing that the phrase
is to be understood as indicating the "first fire of love," i.e., the
first enamorment of a young woman; others understand that the phrase
rather indicates the fire of divine love, that given expression through
the Holy Spirit.  Those who hold to this second view find confirming
evidence in the phrase found both at ^Inferno~ III.6 and ^Paradiso~
VI.11, "primal Love" ^(primo amor)~, referring to the love expressed in
the Holy Spirit, forcing the phrase to be understood (or translated) as
"love in the First Fire," i.e., the Holy Spirit.  While this is surely
a possible explanation, it does require a somewhat forced understanding
of the verse.  Would it be so strange for Piccarda, burning with
reciprocal affection for God's love of her, to seem to Dante like a
young woman just fallen into love?  It is hard to see the harm in such
a reading.  See the similar views of Bosco/Reggio (comm. vv. 67-69).
One might also be reminded of the distance between this scene and the
one containing Dante's recognition of the love felt for him by Matelda
(^Purg~. XXVIII.43-51).  In that passage, Dante imagines that Matelda
is amorously disposed toward him in the normal mortal way; there he is
incorrect.  Here he is fully aware of the kind of love that motivates
Piccarda, but sees it in terms reminiscent of our mortal sort of loving.

	|70-84.~  The bulk of Piccarda's answer to Dante's question (vv. 64-66)
begins with the word ^frate~ (brother), the word that was nearly absent
from Hell (eleven uses, predominantly to indicate a member of a
religious order [nomenclature that the Infernal context makes obviously
suspect at once], and only once to express human fraternity [by
Ulysses, addressing his shipmates, at ^Inf~. XXVI.112 -- with,
according to some readers (see the note to ^Inf~. XXVI.112-113), an
unmistakable whiff of Julius Caesar's fulsome address to his soldiers,
^captatio benevolentiae~ on all fours, as it were]).  It frequently
appeared as a term of address in ^Purgatorio~ (thirteen times): IV.127;
XI.82; XIII.94; XVI.65; XIX.133; XXI.13; XXI.131; XXIII.97; XXIII.112;
XXIV.55; XXVI.115; XXIX.15; XXXIII.23).  Now, in the heavens, it
appears less frequently as a term of address, first here and then in
IV.100; VII.58; VII.130; XXII.61) and a total of four other times.  In
a sense it contains a central message of Piccarda's speech in that it
insists on the relationship that binds all saved Christians in their
fellowship in God, a sense that overcomes the inevitable hierarchical
distinctions found among them in this life.  The love that governs
their will is nothing less than charity, with the result that it is
impossible for them to want an advantage over their brothers and
sisters in grace.  To wish things other than they are, to desire one's
own "advancement," is nothing less than to oppose the will of God.  And
thus all members of this community observe the gradations among
themselves, but find in them the expression of their general and
personal happiness.

Verses 80-85 return to forms for the word ^volont@a~ (will), which
opened (at verse 70) Piccarda's concluding discourse as its main
subject, five times ^(voglia~, ^voglie~, ^voler~, ^'nvoglia~,
^volontade)~, underlining the importance of the will's direction of
human love to divine ends.  The celestial form of will in brotherhood
is vastly different from the will that destroys fraternity here on
earth.  But it is as natural in the realms of Paradise as it is absent
from Hell (and rarely enough found on earth).

	|73-75.~  At first reading, a certain indeterminacy seems possible.
Does Piccarda mean "higher in the heavens" or "higher in the Rose"?
Since the concluding words of the tercet, "that which assigns us to
this place," seems to refer to the sphere of the Moon, it is difficult
to conclude that she means other than in a higher heaven.  See, again,
the note to vv. 29-30.

	|79.~  Our translation reflects Harold Weatherby's discussion (^The
Keen Delight: The Christian Poet in the Modern World~ [Athens:
University of Georgia Press], p. 24), of the Scholastic nature of the
term ^forma~.  Thus our choice of "essence" (in the sense of "formative
principle").

	|85.~  Piccarda's last tercet makes her point with two differing
linguistic gestures, this first a summarizing citation, the second a
powerful metaphor.  Exactly which text she is citing is a matter for
consideration, but a list of suggested candidates includes Luke 2:14
("Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis" [And on earth peace to
men of good will]); Ephesians 2:15 ("Ipse enim est pax noster" [For he
(Christ Jesus) is our peace]); Augustine's ^Confessions~ XIII.9 ("In
bona voluntate pax nobis est" [Our peace lies in willing the good]).
The greater closeness of the last ("E 'n la la sua voluntade @e nostra
pace" [And in His will we find our peace]) makes it the most likely to
have been on Dante's mind as he created his Piccarda.  Grandgent (comm.
to this verse), followed by Singleton in his commentary to this line,
cites the passage from Ephesians.  John Sinclair (^Dante's "Paradiso"~
[New York: Oxford, 1961 {1946}], p. 59), cites the passage from
Augustine.  Readers of these notes may remark upon the parallel then
found between Francesca and Piccarda, each quoting a crucial text of
St. Augustine as the climactic gesture of her speech; see ^Inferno~
V.138 and the note thereto.

	|86-87.~  Piccarda's metaphor for the totality of the peace found in
God reverses our normal sense of the proclivity of bodies to descend or
to ascend (a phenomenon that is almost the trade-mark of ^Paradiso~,
beginning with Beatrice's explanation that it here is as natural to be
drawn up toward God as on earth to be drawn down by gravity; see ^Par~.
I.136-141).  In ^Paradiso~ I.113 Beatrice has used the phrase "lo gran
mar de l'essere" (the vastness of the sea of being) to refer to all of
God's creation, both here and above.  Now Piccarda redeploys this
metaphor to apply it only to God Himself, seen as the ocean to which
all creation, whether direct or indirect, flows up.

While many commentators, moved by Piccarda, think of Francesca da
Rimini, only Singleton (comm. to these verses) adverts to Francesca's
very words (^Inf~. V.98-99) as being remembered here.  Both ladies use
watery metaphors to express the peace that they either long for or
enjoy.

	|88-90.~  Piccarda's words have finally made it plain to Dante how one
can be nearer or closer to God in Heaven and yet feel equally blessed
with all who share beatitude, disregarding the matter of relative rank.
 Once again the phrasing, now representing not so much the response of
the protagonist (see vv. 64-66) as the understanding of the poet,
raises the question that is necessarily so persistent for a reader of
this canto: Do references to paradisal "placement" speak of the ranked
order of the saved in the Rose in the Empyrean or of their presences in
the celestial spheres?  Once we arrive in the Rose (^Par~. XXXII), we
will see that there is a ranking (by one's row in the Rose bowl); on
the other hand, there does not seem to be much in the way of ranking
going on within each sphere (there may be some in Jupiter), if the
spheres themselves are ranked, progressing from lowest to most exalted.
 Again, see the note to vv. 29-30.

	|91-96.~  The second simile of the canto (see vv. 10-18 for the first)
is an elaborate way of describing the protagonist's reminder to his
colloquist that she had not fully answered his second question (verse
41), the one dealing with her and her companions' "lot" in the
afterworld.  As is frequent in the post-Convivial ^Paradiso~, the
material for the simile proper is drawn from alimentation.  In a real
sense, as Robin McCallister suggested in a paper in 1968, for Dante the
^Paradiso~ offered him the opportunity to complete the ^Convivio~, now
in better, more "orthodox," form.

	|95-96.~  The as-yet-unexpressed portion of Piccarda's self-explanation
is, in metaphor, compared to the unfinished portion of a woven fabric,
an image that undoubtedly reflects the Florence of Dante's day, in the
heart of which the wool merchants plied their trade, as one is reminded
each time one visits the Societ@a Dantesca Italiana in the Palagio
della Lana.

	|97-99.~  Piccarda is referring to the companion and fellow citizen of
St. Francis of Assisi, founder (in collaboration with Francis) of her
own order in 1212, the ^Clarisse~, St. Clare (1194-1253).  "[S]he was
canonized by [Pope] Alexander IV in 1255.  The rule of her order, which
was confirmed in 1247, and again in 1253, two days before her death, by
Pope Innocent IV, was characterized by extreme austerity" (Toynbee
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~], "Chiara, Santa").

As Lauren Scancarelli Seem suggested in conversation many years ago,
Piccarda's reference to St. Clare, as being loftier than she,
parallels, in opposition, Francesca's reference to her husband,
Gianciotto, as being fated to a place lower in Hell than she (see
^Inf~. V.107).  And see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.13-15.  The
resemblances and differences among the first three women in the three
^cantiche~ (Francesca in ^Inf~. V, Pia de' Tolomei in ^Purg~. V, and
Piccarda) have offered occasion for frequent comment.  See Ruggero
Stefanini ("Piccarda e la luna," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 11 [Fall
1992]: 26-31) for a study of structural similarities in these three
narratives.

	|97.~  Dante's coinage, ^inciela~ (inheavens, "set[s] in a higher
sphere"), again raises the issue of whether he refers to the Empyrean
(in which Clare [whom we do not see there] is seated higher in the Rose
than Piccarda) or to yet another heavenly sphere (e.g., that of the
Sun, where we learn of St. Francis in Canto XI). It is very difficult
to be certain, despite Bosco/Reggio's assurances that all is under
control (see their note to vv. 28-30).  The second alternative,
however, does seem more likely (i.e., St. Clare, in Piccarda's view
[the poet's also?], is in the Sun [or perhaps in Saturn]).  Once more,
see the note to vv. 29-30.

	|100-102.~  Piccarda's language recollects various biblical passages
equating the love of God with marriage to Christ.  Cf. the Song of
Solomon, ^passim~, as read by Christian interpreters; Matthew 9:15 and
25:1-12; Mark 2:19; Luke 5:34, but in particular the parable of the
wise and foolish virgins in Matthew 25.

	|106-108.~  This celebrated tercet condenses a moment of horror
followed by a life of despondency into a single unit of verse.  As for
the events to which Piccarda refers, the most frequent understanding
among the commentators is that her brother, Corso, wanted to marry her
off to one Rossellino della Tosa (see Singleton, comm. to ^Purg~.
XXIV.10) in order to further his political/financial ambition and, for
this reason, had her abducted from her convent.

	|109-120.~  Constance of Sicily is the only companion mentioned by
Piccarda (and one wonders, here and elsewhere, why, if the souls appear
in the spheres only for the instruction of visiting Dante, they always
seem to be accompanied by crowds of anonymous others, who are thus
temporarily deprived of the joys of the Empyrean).

Bosco/Reggio offer a succinct account of the significant facts about
her as they were known to Dante (in their comment to verse 118):
"Constance, daughter of Roger II, king of Sicily, born in 1154, last
heir of the Norman kingdom of Naples and Sicily, in 1185 married Henry
VI of Swabia, son of Frederick Barbarossa.  By marrying her, the
emperor was finally obtaining dominion over southern Italy, which he
had in vain attempted to conquer by force of arms.  In 1194 Frederick
II was born of this marriage.  Constance, widowed in 1197, until her
death in 1198, knew how to govern the kingdom with a shrewd sort of
wisdom.  With sure political instinct, sensing that she was near death,
she named Pope Innocent III guardian of her three-year-old son,
Frederick.  During the time that the latter was emperor, the Guelphs
spread the story that Constance had been made a nun against her will
and that, at the age of 52, taken from the convent by the archbishop of
Palermo, she had been joined in matrimony to Henry VI.  Frederick II,
the 'Antichrist,' would then have been born to an ex-nun who was at the
same time a woman of a certain age, and thus opposing the precepts of
every law, whether human or divine.  In this way did Guelph propaganda
attempt to discredit the emperor.  Constance, in fact, had never been a
nun and had married Henry at the age of 31.  Dante accepted the story
that she had become a nun, but omitted any negative elements from it,
thus being able to illumine the figure of the empress in a lofty poetic
light, making her the innocent victim of political machinations and
violent acts.  The halo of light that surrounds her, the refulgence in
her of all of the light of this heaven, the attributes accorded her,
all these tell us of Dante's high esteem for the 'Great Norman,' with
the negative elements of Guelph propaganda transformed into a luminous
attestation of the poet's reverence."

Piccarda's remarks at vv. 112-117 will puzzle Dante in the next canto
(^Par~. IV.19-21).

For a study of Piccarda and Costanza see Enrico Malato ("Il difetto
della volont@a che 'non s'ammorza': Piccarda e Costanza: Lettura del
canto III del ^Paradiso~," ^Filologia e critica~ 20 [1995]: 278-317).

	|109.~  This is the first time the word "splendor" ^(splendore)~ is
used to describe the appearance of a soul in ^Paradiso~ (but see also
at least ^Par~. V.103; IX.13; XI.39; XIV.95; XXI.32; XXIII.82; XXV.106;
XXIX.138).  In the heaven of the Sun we learn that the souls are
enclosed in their own light (e.g., ^Par~. XIII.48), thus explaining why
we would not be able to recognize them even had we previously known
them -- as well as why Dante ^can~ recognize the features of Piccarda,
i.e., she still possesses features, if they are but faint.  Thus for
Constance to be treated in this way, as though she were appearing in a
higher heaven, tells us a good deal about Dante's admiration for her.

	|118.~  Her name, Constance, plays with and against her former
weakness, inconstancy, in that, if she was inconstant in her vows when
forced (as she was at least in Dante's sense of her life) back into the
world, she was also constant in her heart (see verse 117).  It is also
interesting that there are reports that the name assumed by Piccarda,
in the convent of the ^Clarisse~, was Constance (see Lombardi (comm. to
^Purg~. XXIV.10 and 49).  In ^Purgatorio~ III.113 Constance is
remembered with great affection by her grandson, Manfred (like his
grandmother in this, not mentioning the name of the magnificent but
hated "last of the Roman emperors," Frederick II [see ^Conv~.
IV.iii.6]).  As has been suggested (see the note to ^Purg~. III.143),
that canto is also a "canto of two Constances."

	|120.~  Frederick is referred to as the third powerful figure in the
line of Frederick Barbarossa and Henry VI, the three Swabian emperors.
See Grandgent (comm. to verse 119): "The Swabian Emperors are called
'blasts' because of the violence and the brief duration of their
activity.  Frederick I (Barbarossa) was the first; the 'second wind'
was Constance's husband, Henry VI; the third and last was her son,
Frederick II."

	|121-123.~  Where do these two Constances go after they recede from
view?  Opinions are divided, some more recent commentators (beginning
with Costa in 1819 [comm. to verse 122] claiming that they head back to
the Empyrean (as will, apparently, many souls encountered later in the
^cantica~); others are of the opinion that they go deep into the mass
of the Moon (e.g., Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 115-123]: "disparuit in
corpore lunae frigido" [disappeared into the cold matter of the Moon]).
 This is also maintained by Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 121-130):
"profond@o nel corpo lunare" (sank deep into the matter of the Moon).
Most, however, do not even raise the question of where Piccarda (not to
mention Constance or, indeed, any of their companions) is headed.

This is the last passage in the canto that makes the reader confront
the problem of the permanent residence of the souls we see in the Moon
(see the note to vv. 29-30).  Here, the sense of descent would seem to
make the second hypothesis more likely.  The fact that, among the early
commentators, only Benvenuto and Francesco da Buti  tried to assign a
destination to their departure makes the problematic nature of the
passage apparent.  In the later nineteenth century, Scartazzini (comm.
to verse 123) and Campi (comm. to this tercet) also draw the conclusion
that Costa did, basing it on what the next canto (vv. 28-39) will make
clear: The souls are all in the Empyrean and descend from there to
manifest themselves in the planets (or so Dante called both Moon and
Sun along with those to which we reserve that appellation).  However,
twentieth-century exegetes preferred to admire the aesthetic
attractiveness of the passage rather than apply themselves to this
little conundrum.  The result is that there is no "official" view of
the problem, which remains unsolved.  Dante should have shown Piccarda
and the others going up, returning to God; he did not, and we have
either, like Scartazzini, tried to be more correct than our author or,
like Benvenuto, followed our poetic sense to make Dante seem to violate
his own rules -- at least the rules that he would lay down in the next
canto.  There is, according to an Italian proverb, always a third way
("C'@e sempre una terza via").  In this case, that has proven more
popular than the first two, the way of avoidance, whether knowingly
chosen or not.

	|121-122.~  For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note
to ^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

	|124-130.~  In the wake of the disappearance of the two nuns, the poet
prepares us for the answers to the questions to which they have given
rise.  These lines could, without disrupting the reader's sense of
order, have been moved forward into the next canto.  As we have seen
(since at least ^Inferno~ VIII, which opens with the often noted
self-consciousness of the words "Io dico, seguitando..." [To continue,
let me say...]), the reader experiences a sense that there was a kind
of willful and arbitrary process at work in the poet's decisions about
how a given canto should begin (or end).  That Dante was increasingly
amused by this practical poetic problem is evidenced in the growing
number of ungainly narrative re-starts as we move into ^Purgatorio~.
While such decisions are not easily made or agreed with, perhaps a list
of "unstable" or otherwise problematical beginnings might include
^Inferno~ VIII, XIII, XIV, XXI, XXV, XXVII, XXIX, XXXI, XXXIII;
^Purgatorio~ III, V, VII, X, XII, XVII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII,
XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII; ^Paradiso~ III, VI,
IX, XII, XV, XVIII, XXI, XXII, XXXII, XXXIII.)  Dante obviously enjoyed
playfully challenging our sense of proper beginnings and endings.  For
a similar assessment of the chapter beginnings and endings in ^Don
Quijote~, see R.S. Willis (^The Phantom Chapters of the "Quijote"~ [New
York: Hispanic Institute in the United States, 1953]).

Battaglia Ricci ("Piccarda, o della carit@a: lettura del terzo canto
del ^Paradiso~," ^Critica e filologia~ 14 [1989]: 29), cites with
approval Marti's argument ("Il canto III del ^Paradiso~," in ^Letture
dantesche. III. "Paradiso,"~ ed. G. Getto [Florence: Sansoni, 1964
{1961}], p. 1385) for the circular movement of the canto, from Beatrice
as Sun to Beatrice as Sun (Dante is in the first case rewarded with an
understanding of the dark places in the Moon; in the second he is
promised an answer [if in rather disquieting terms] to the two
questions that his interview with Piccarda has given rise to in him.
Marti characterizes the first Beatrice as the "sun of love" and the
second as the "sun of knowledge").
