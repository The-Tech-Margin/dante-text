	|1-36.~  Dante clearly offers these verses as an introduction to the 
third and final ^cantica~ as a whole.  So much is dealt with in them, 
and in precisely such a way as to set ^Paradiso~ off from the rest of 
the poem, that it is perhaps worth considering them as a unit before 
attempting to come to grips with particular lines.  One burden of these 
remarks (and of the specific glosses that follow them) is that Dante is 
once again (see, e.g., ^Purg~. XXIV.52-54) playing a dangerous game as 
he addresses his role as poet.  He presents himself, if in hidden ways 
(in modern political parlance, he "preserves deniability"), as being 
inspired by God to write this part of the poem (a barely hidden claim 
in the first two canticles as well).  At the same time he allows us to 
believe, if we are uncomfortable with that claim here, that he is only 
doing what all poets do, invoking deities for poetic inspiration as has 
been conventional since Homer's time.  And so here we shall find him 
referring to Apollo (in verse 13), Mt. Parnassus (verse 16), the satyr 
Marsyas (verse 20) and Daphne (in the form of the laurel tree -- verse 
25).  Yet all those classicizing gestures do not quite obfuscate the 
clear post-classical network of the necessary Christian appurtenances 
of a poem that begins by remembering its culmination and conclusion, 
the vision of God in the Empyrean.

We are fortunate in the fact that the first dozen of these opening 
verses are the subject of a commentary written by no less an expert 
than Dante himself, in his ^Epistle to Cangrande~. 
The ^Epistle~ cannot easily be denied its Dantean paternity now that 
Luca Azzetta ("Le chiose alla ^Commedia~ di Andrea Lancia, l'^Epistola 
a Cangrande~ e altre questioni dantesche," ^L'Alighieri~ 21 [2003]: 
5-76) has demonstrated that it was known and extensively cited by 
Andrea Lancia around 1345, thus countering the major piece of negative 
evidence, which was the alleged absence of direct reference to Dante's 
authorship during the fourteenth century.  Azzetta was soon joined by 
Selene Sarteschi ("Ancora in merito all'Epistola XIII a Cangrande della 
Scala," ^L'Alighieri~ 26 [2005]: 63-96), who studied similarities among 
the epistle and the other late Latin works.  For what may prove to be 
the last gasp of those who would deny the epistle its Dantean 
paternity, see Silvia Conte ("Le finalit@a del comico: una nuova 
proposta per l'interpretazione della ^intitulatio~ della ^Commedia~," 
^Critica del testo~ 4 [2001]: 559-74).  She reviews (pp. 569-74) some 
recent work that also would deny the authenticity of the document, that 
by Brugnoli, Tavoni, Inglese, and especially Baranski.  It is hard to 
believe that what has always been a weak argument should have to suffer 
so slow and difficult a death.  However, the stakes for our basic 
understanding of what Dante was about are so high and the investment of 
effort (and of reputation) on the part of the opposers so great that 
one realizes that we may hear again, from some of them (and from 
others?), that a "forger" created Dante's most significant surviving 
epistle, or at least the greater part of it.

Dante himself marks off these thirty-six verses as introductory, 
referring to the rest of the ^cantica~ (^Par~. I.37-XXXIII.145) as its 
"pars executiva" (executive portion [^Epist~. XIII.43]), i.e., the 
narrative, of which he says nothing, if he seems to promise to do so 
(^Epist~. XIII.89).  In fact, his detailed treatment (the ^pars 
executiva~, as it were, of his epistle) is reserved, interestingly 
enough, only for the first dozen of these three dozen lines, which 
receive, after a general exposition of their content (^Epist~. 
XIII.49-52), some four pages of analysis (^Epist~. XIII.53-85).  (We 
might reflect that, had the commentator continued at this rate, he 
would have produced a document of some 1600 pages for ^Paradiso~ 
alone).  Then the commentator begins to treat his subject at breakneck 
speed: The last ^terzina~ of the group (vv. 10-12) receives only a 
single brief sentence of attention (^Epist~. XIII.85), while the 
following fifteen verses (13-27) are glossed even more hurriedly 
(^Epist~. XIII.86-87).  Did Dante plan to write a full-scale commentary 
to the ^Commedia~?  Maurizio Palma di Cesnola (^Semiotica dantesca: 
Profetismo e diacronia~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp. 80, 140), is of the 
opinion that Dante intended eventually to gloss his own work 
completely.  We shall never know....  On the other hand, the final 
words of this epistle, in which Dante apparently hopes that Cangrande 
will give him the opportunity to take on this task, if we accept them 
at face value, might seem to hold out that possibility: "I trust, 
however, that your Magnificence may afford me the opportunity to 
continue this useful exposition at some other time" (^Epist~. XIII.88). 
 Was it Dante's intention, had he not caught malarial fever and died on 
his embassy to Venice in 1321, to enlighten us with a full-scale 
commentary to the ^Commedia~, as he had done in both ^Vita nuova~ and 
^Convivio~?  In these, especially the latter, he regales us with 
literal and allegorical expositions of his own poetic texts, but the 
^Epistle to Cangrande~ is much more reticent, cagey, strategic, and not 
at all the revealing sort of exposition we might hope to find in a 
commentary put forward by the very author of a work.  And so, had he 
indeed spent years interpreting his poem for us, he might only have 
helped us with its literal sense (no small thing), and left its more 
dangerous gestures as moot as the epistle leaves, for example, the 
invocation of Apollo.

Except for Scartazzini, a happy and fairly early exception (see his 
comments to ^Par~. I.1-12, I.1, I.2, I.4, I.6, I.7, I.9, I.13-36, 
I.13), few exegetes have made wide use of the epistle in their 
responses to the opening of the ^Paradiso~ (Charles Singleton, in his 
"Special Note" to the canto and then in his commentary [^Par~. I.1, 
I.2-3, I.4, I.5-9, I.13-36] and Umberto Bosco/Giovanni Reggio 
[^Par~. I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4, I.6, I.7-9, I.12, I.13] offer notable 
exceptions; see also Ignazio Baldelli ["Il canto I del ^Paradiso~," 
^L'Alighieri~ 1/2 {1993}: 59-74]).

Dante's practice as composer of prologues to each of his three 
^cantiche~ is diverse, as may be readily observed in the following 
table:

\<pre\>
                  introduction        invocation            narrative begins
^Inferno~ I         1-9                 II.7 [delayed]        I.10        
^Purgatorio~ I      1-6                 I.7-12                I.13
^Paradiso~ I        1-12                I.13-36               I.37
\</pre\>

^Paradiso~, it seems clear, required more painstaking justification 
than anything before it, and this, the fifth of the nine invocations in 
the poem (see the note to ^Inf~. II.7-9), is by far the most elaborate, 
requiring eight tercets for its development.  We shall return to the 
invocatory portion of the introduction to ^Paradiso~ shortly; here we 
may simply observe that the self-reflective poetic gestures made in 
those eight tercets occupy fully two-thirds of this introductory poetic 
space, but less than 3% of his analysis in the ^Epistle~ (XIII.85-87); 
Dante has previously limited his analysis of vv. 1-12 to a ^literal~ 
exposition only, i.e., he eschews the possible deeper meanings; next, 
he does not offer more than a summarizing gesture toward vv. 13-36, and 
refuses us even a literal exposition.  This sort of cageyness might 
long ago have convinced those skeptical about the Dantean authorship of 
the epistle that only he would have dealt with us in this way; other 
commentators are far more likely to have waded straight into the swamp 
of the deeper meaning of these verses.  And thus the epistle cuts away 
just as things begin to get extraordinarily interesting.

For Dante's discussion of the opening of this ^cantica~, with his 
distinctions among the terms "proem," "prologue," and "prelude" 
(derived, he says, from Aristotle's ^Rhetoric~), see ^Epistle~ 
XIII.44-46.

For a close examination of Dante's combination of a protasis insisting 
on the ineffability of what he has experienced coupled with a 
countering claim, expressed as an invocation, that he somehow ^can~ 
express something, see Angelo Jacomuzzi ("'Ond'io son fatto scriba,'" 
in his ^L'imago al cerchio. Invenzione e visione nella ^Divina 
Commedia~ [Milan: Silva, 1968], pp. 29-100) and Giuseppe Ledda (^La 
guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 17-30).

	|1.~  The phrasing "di colui che tutto move" (of Him who moves all 
things) is unmistakably derived from Aristotle's "unmoved mover" (see 
^Metaphysics~ XII.7), frequent in Scholastic writings, as Scartazzini 
(comm. ^Par~. I.1) insists.  For one of Dante's previous references to 
the "unmoved mover," see ^Convivio~ III.xv.15; and for Aristotle's 
concept and Aquinas's gloss of it, see Singleton (comm. ^Par~. 
XXVIII.41-42).  See also ^Purg~. XXV.70.  "La gloria," on the other 
hand, initiates and controls the Scholastic definition in order to 
Christianize its terminology.  ("Glory" is notably and understandably 
absent from Aristotle's or Thomas's discussion of the first mover.)  
The word has various possible meanings in the ^Commedia~ (see the 
article "gloria" by Sebastiano Aglian@o [^ED~ 1975.3, pp. 240-42]): 
e.g., it may represent earthly renown, a shining quality, the state of 
blessedness.  Here it may retain some of its more earthly resonance, 
but in only the highest sense: God's shining forth from his beatitude, 
the most "famous" of all things that exist.

	|2-3.~  The ^Letter to Cangrande~ devotes well over a page (^Epist~. 
XIII.53-65) to these verses, arguing that we are to find the glory of 
God's Being reflected in all that exists in His secondary creation; 
likewise, His essence, or His intellect, lies at the heart of all the 
substances found in the created universe.  Thus it is not surprising 
that we find a gradation among even the things that God has made, some 
being more or less corruptible than others.  Dante offers no examples 
in this difficult passage, but it is clear that he is thinking of the 
angels at the highest end of creation, and of the less exalted forms of 
matter (e.g., rocks, mud) at the lowest.  The words ^penetra~ 
(pervades, penetrates) and ^risplende~ (shines [with reflected light]) 
distinguish between God's unmediated glory and its reflection, its 
quality various as what it is reflected by.  

	|4-12.~  For the interrelated phenomena in ^Paradiso~ (beginning with 
this passage) of "the seeing and understanding of the protagonist -- 
with their related difficulties -- and the ability to remember and to 
express his experience -- with ^their~ related difficulties," see the 
densely supported observations of Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della 
lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 243-98).  And for Dante's 
exposition of vv. 5-9, see ^Epistle~ XIII.77-84.

	|4-6.~  The reference to St. Paul's ascent to the heavens is 
unmistakable (II Cor. 12:3-4) and has long been acknowledged (at least 
since the time [ca. 1385] of Francesco da Buti [comm. ^Par~. I.1-12]).  
For a particularly incisive treatment, see Landino's commentary on this 
tercet.  More recently, see the extended treatment by Giuseppe Ledda 
(^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002)], pp. 243-59).  And 
see Giuseppe Di Scipio (^The Presence of Pauline Thought in the Works 
of Dante~ [Lewiston, N.Y.: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1995], p. 253), for 
the pertinence here of the concept of ^excessus mentis~ (but see the 
previous recognitions of Sapegno [comm. ^Par~. I.6-9] and a few other 
modern commentators).  For the Pauline background of the concept, see 
Di Scipio, pp. 153-55.

	|4.~  Some commentators, perhaps beginning with Pietrobono (comm. 
^Par~. I.4), put forward the notion that the reference is to all ten 
heavens, that is, to the totality of this super-terrestrial world.  A 
few have also argued that the reference is to the outermost of the 
physical heavenly spheres, either the Crystalline, or the Primum 
Mobile.  However, it seems utterly clear that Dante is referring to the 
Empyrean, God's "home" (insofar as He who is everywhere can be thought 
of as located in a particular anywhere as well).  Scartazzini (comm. 
^Par~. I.4) was perhaps the first to refer to the ^Epistle to 
Cangrande~ (which devotes considerable space to a literal exposition of 
this verse [^Epist~. XIII.66-76]) as eventual justification of this 
reading: "And it is called the Empyrean, which is as much as to say, 
the heaven glowing with fire or heat; not that there is material fire 
or heat therein, but spiritual, which is holy love, or charity" 
(XIII.68 -- tr. P. Toynbee).

	|5.~  It is difficult ^not~ to think of the heavenly experience granted 
St. Paul.

	|7.~  For his several discussions of the language of desire in Dante, 
with special reference to ^Paradiso~, see Lino Pertile ("'La punta del 
disio': storia di una metafora dantesca," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 
7 [1990]: 3-28); ("^Paradiso~: a Drama of Desire," in ^Word and Drama 
in Dante: Essays on the "Divina Commedia,"~ ed. J.C. Barnes & J. 
Petrie [Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1993], pp. 143-80); (^La puttana 
e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ 
[Ravenna: Longo, 1998], pp. 87-133; ("Quale amore va in Paradiso?" in 
^"Le donne, i cavalieri, l'arme, gli amori": Poema e romanzo: la 
narrativa lunga in Italia~, ed. Francesco Bruni [Venice: Marsilio, 
2001], pp. 59-70).  And now see his global study of this subject (^La 
punta del disio: Semantica del desiderio nella "Commedia"~ [Fiesole: 
Cadmo, 2005]).

	|9.~  On this verse, "che dietro la memoria non pu@o ire" (that memory 
cannot follow after it), see Bruno Nardi, "Perch$e 'dietro la memoria 
non pu@o ire' (^Paradiso~, I, 9)," in his ^"Lecturae" e altri studi 
danteschi~, ed. Rudy Abardo (Florence: Le Lettere, 1990 [1960], pp. 
267-76), who examines the understanding of the nature of memory as it 
is reflected in the traditions that develop from Aristotle and 
Augustine and come down into Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas in 
order to establish that "when our intellect comes near to the beatific 
vision of God..., it so immerses itself in it... that the memory and 
the image-receiving capacity of the mind are unable to contain it any 
longer" (p. 273).  As Poletto (comm. ^Par~. I.7-9) and Tozer (comm. 
^Par~. I.7-9) point out, Dante has explained this verse in the ^Epistle 
to Cangrande~ (XIII.77): "Et reddit causam dicens 'quod intellectus in 
tantum profundat se' in ipsum 'desiderium suum', quod est Deus, 'quod 
memoria sequi non potest'" (And he gives the reason, saying that "the 
intellect plunges itself to such depth" in its very longing, which is 
for God, "that the memory cannot follow" [tr. P. Toynbee]).  There is 
(mainly unexpressed) disagreement among the commentators as to whether 
the memory is with the intellect in its first experience of the Godhead 
and only loses that perception afterwards or, as Dante seems to be 
saying, is left behind at the outset in the intellect's excitement.  
Whatever hypothesis one accepts, the result is the same, as the last 
verses of the poem will also announce: The vision of God cannot be 
contained in human memory; rather, we can only claim a memory of having 
had a experience, now lost from memory.  (For more on this passage, see the note to 
^Par~. XXIII.50.)

	|10-12.~  As though in preparation for the invocation that is to come 
in the following tercet, Dante resorts to a series of phrases or words 
laden with literary overtone, whether intrinsically or by the context 
offered from their other appearances in the ^Commedia~: ^veramente~ 
(discussed in the note to ^Par~. I.10), ^regno santo~, ^mente~, 
^tesoro~, ^materia~, ^il mio canto~.  For instance, the "holy kingdom" 
(^regno santo~) that is Paradise may remind us of medieval poets 
assigning themselves geographic/political areas as subjects of their 
work (e.g., the "matter of Troy," the "matter of France," etc.); all 
the rest of these terms are also used by Dante in passages that refer 
to the writing of his poem.  For ^materia,~ see ^Paradiso~ X.27, where 
Dante refers to the text of the last canticle as "that matter of which 
I am made the scribe." The epistle is perhaps surprisingly chary in its 
treatment of this "overheated" tercet, which receives a single sentence 
of explication (^Epist~. XIII.85).  As will be the case for the even 
more shocking passage that follows, the invocation to Apollo, it seems 
that the commentator does not want to tip the poet's hand, and none of 
these "loaded" literary terms is referred to.

	|10.~  While it is clear that, as commentators have pointed out, 
Dante's conjunction (^veramente~, here "nevertheless") mirrors the 
formality of the Latin conjunction ^verumtamen~, it also necessarily 
exhibits the only partly hidden claim that this poem is a record of 
things that have truly (^veramente~) been observed.  In 1791 Lombardi 
(comm. ^Par~. I.10) was perhaps the first commentator to insist on the 
force of the Latin root, specifically denying the meaning of ^con 
verit@a~, ^certamente~, found in the earlier commentaries.  It is, 
however, difficult to accept the notion that the obvious Italian 
meaning is utterly effaced in the Latinism.  In accord with that view 
Benvenuto (comm. ^Par~. I.10-12) glosses ^veramente~ as "not in empty 
dreams."  Poetry, as commentators should realize perhaps more often 
than we do, has the propensity to open into a plurality of meanings 
that cannot be fully rendered in prose. (Dante, however, in ^Vita 
nuova~ [XXV.10] clearly himself sponsors the notion that the meaning of 
poems are known to those who make them: "For, if any one should dress 
his poem in images and rhetorical coloring and then, being asked to 
strip his poem of such dress in order to reveal its true meaning, would 
not be able to do so -- this would be a veritable cause for shame.  And 
my best friend [Guido Cavalcanti] and I are well acquainted with some 
who compose so clumsily" [tr. M. Musa]).

Since most of the seven of the preceding uses of the adverb fairly 
obviously offer only the more usual Italian sense of the word (i.e., 
"truly," "really" -- as will most of the seven that follow), its 
undertone here is not easily muffled.

	|11.~  The word ^tesoro~ is focal in a number of contexts as we move 
through the poem.  For these, see the note to ^Par~. XVII.121-122.  
Here Dante claims to have laid up in his memory the "treasure of 
Heaven" (see Matth. 19:21).

	|12.~  For the concept behind Dante's word ^materia~, see the note to 
^Par~. I.10-12.  As for the noun ^canto~, when it signifies "song" (and 
not "side" or "edge," a meaning it has fully seven times, interspersed 
through all three ^cantiche~), it is used twenty-four times in the 
poem, and includes reference to a gamut of "songs": (1) classical epic 
(^Inf~. IV.95); (2) a specific canto or passage in the ^Commedia~ 
(^Inf~. XX.2; ^Inf~. XXXIII.90; ^Purg~. I.10; ^Par~. V.16; ^Par~. 
V.139); (3) Dante's ^former~ song, the second ode of the ^Convivio~ 
(^Purg~. II.107; ^Purg~. II.131); (4) the Ulysses-seducing song of the 
Siren in Dante's second Purgatorial dream (^Purg~. XIX.23); (5) songs 
of biblical derivation sung as part of the rite of purgation, i.e., the 
^Miserere~ sung by the penitents in ante-purgatory (^Purg~. V.27) and 
the ^Gloria in excelsis~ sung by the penitent avaricious at Statius's 
liberation from ^his~ penitence (^Purg~. XX.140); (6) Charity's 
directive song to which Faith and Hope measure the steps of their dance 
(^Purg~. XXIX.128); and finally (7) twelve songs in the ^Paradiso~ 
directed to or emanating from Heaven, first the holy songs of the 
Seraphim (^Par~. IX.77) and, last, the ^Gloria~ sung by the Church 
Triumphant (if not by Jesus and Mary, already returned to the Empyrean 
-- ^Par~. XXVII.3).  The other ten occurrences in ^Paradiso~ are found 
as follows: ^Par~. X.73, XII.6 (twice), XII.7, XX.40, XX.144, XXII.10, 
XXIV.23, XXV.109, XXVI.67.

	|13-36.~  The author of the ^Epistle to Cangrande~ himself divides the 
introduction to ^Paradiso~ into two parts, vv. 1-12 and 13-36 (^Epist~. 
XIII. 48).  While the invocation proper occupies only three verses, 
this entire passage supports and extends it.  (For an intense 
consideration of Dante's use of invocation, see Ledda, ^La guerra della 
lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 55-63.)

	|13-15.~  The invocation of God, even if as the "good Apollo," is, once 
one considers the poetic moment, almost a necessity.  (Paulinus of Nola 
apostrophizes Christ as follows: "Salve o Apollo vere" [Save us, O true 
Apollo -- ^Carmina~ II.51], as noted by Ernst Kantorowicz ["Dante's 
'Two Suns,'" in Walter J. Fischel, ed., ^Semitic and Oriental Studies, 
a Volume Presented to William Potter on the Occasion of His 
Seventy-fifth Birthday, October 29, 1949~ {Berkeley: University of 
California Press, 1951}, pp. 217-31], among a plethora of similar 
expressions found in Greek [and some Latin] syncretistic passages.)  
Who else but God Himself can serve as the ultimate "muse" for a poem 
about the ultimate mysteries of the Christian faith?  If the first two 
of these three verses indirectly but clearly associate Apollo with God 
(the word ^valore~ in verse 14 is used at least thrice again, 
undoubtedly to refer to the Power of God the Father [see ^Par~. I.107, 
X.3, and XXXIII.81]), while the second indirectly but clearly 
associates Dante with St. Paul (see ^Inf~. II.28, "lo Vas d'elez,ione" 
[the Chosen Vessel]), since Dante, likewise, will be made God's chosen 
vessel (^vaso~).  And what of the gift that this poet seeks?  The 
"belov@ed laurel," in this exalted context, becomes, rather than poetic 
fame, the true immortality of those who are blessed for eternity, 
another and better kind of immortality: the "laurel" granted by God to 
his immortal (i.e., saved) poet, rewarded, among other things, for 
having written, under His inspiration, of Him.  In the ^Epistle to 
Cangrande~, Dante offers the following explanation of the reason poets 
call on higher authority: "For they have need of invocation in a large 
measure, inasmuch as they have to petition the superior beings for 
something beyond the ordinary range of human powers, something almost 
in the nature of a divine gift" (tr. P. Toynbee -- the last phrase 
reads ^quasi divinum quoddam munus~, representing an only slightly 
veiled reference to the theologized nature of his "Apollo").  For 
Dante's single use of the Latinism "muno," based on ^munus~, see ^Par~. 
XIV.33.  For a somewhat different view, one closer to the usual 
understanding, see Robin Kirkpatrick, ^Dante's Paradiso and the 
Limitations of Modern Criticism~ (Cambridge: Cambridge University 
Press, 1978),  pp. 108-11, he believes that in the invocation Dante 
seems to be seeking only an intellectual or philosophical competence.  
We should not forget, if we insist on the pagan valence of Apollo, that 
Dante has already twice "transvaluated" a pagan god into the Christian 
deity: see ^Inf~. XXXI.92 and ^Purg~. VI.118 for the expression ^sommo 
Giove~ (highest Jove).  This is surely the same phenomenon that we 
witness here.

Do these "transvaluations" of the more usual understandings of poetic 
inspiration and success entirely erase the traces of their original 
reference among poets and their audiences?  We are, after all, reading 
a poem.  And we should have no doubt but that its human agent was as 
interested in earthly success as any other poet (and perhaps more than 
most).  However, the context makes a pagan understanding of these grand 
poetic gestures at the same time both impossible and desirable.  We are 
almost forced to recognize the divine claims made by this very human 
agent, but we are allowed to understand them in completely human terms 
as well.  We find ourselves in a usual dilemma: if we take the truth 
claims made by the poet on behalf of his poem seriously, we feel 
greatly troubled (mortal agents are not allowed such claims unless they 
are ^demonstrably~ chosen, as, to Christian believers, was Paul); on 
the other hand, if we insist that these claims are in fact not true, we 
sense that we have failed to deal with something that, if it makes us 
uncomfortable, nonetheless must be dealt with; other poets do not make 
such stringent demands upon our belief.  In another way of phrasing 
this, we can only say No after we have said Yes, that is, by 
understanding Dante's veiled claims, no matter what we eventually 
decide to think of them.

	|13.~  It seems clear that, whatever the eventual identity we are meant 
to assign to Ovid's amorous god, there is one that this personage 
cannot possibly have in its higher context, that of Apollo, pagan god 
of the Sun, music, etc.  Ovid's Apollo (^Metam~. I.452-567), pursuing 
Daphne with immediate disastrous consequence for the girl, is, we are 
probably meant to understand, the "bad" Apollo.  The later poet's "sun 
God" is in antithetic relationship to him when Dante reconstructs the 
Ovidian tale into a sort of Christian riddle.  Since the pagan Apollo 
was understood as the poet seeking immortality (Daphne is 
metamorphosed, of course, into the laurel tree), we are left to 
consider what the laurel becomes in this rarified circumstance.  The 
best understanding of it is perhaps that Dante is invoking the aid of 
the true God in his triune majesty (see the note to ^Par~. II.7-9) to 
make his inspired poem so that he himself may achieve "immortal glory, 
eternal life in the Empyrean" (the use of the phrase here reflects 
Jamie Fumo's defense of her doctoral dissertation before the Department 
of English at Princeton concerning Chaucer's appropriation of Apollo on 
23 May 2003); and now see her discussion of the English poet's 
"subversion" of Ovid's god ("'Little ^Troilus~': ^Heroides~ 5 and Its 
Ovidian Contexts in Chaucer's ^Troilus and Criseyde~," ^Studies in 
Philology~ 100 [2003]: 288-90).  This understanding of the laurel 
should be set against that found earlier in the poem (see ^Purgatorio~ 
XI.91-93 and note), for unlike the green crown of mortal achievements, 
which adorns its winner's brow only until someone is eventually 
adjudged better by the crowd, this one is the reward of true 
immortality for the writing of the poem "to which both heaven and earth 
have set their hand" (^Par~. XXV.2).  The passage sounds exactly like 
the usual petition for aid in making a poem, but has this subtle and 
absolutely crucial difference. The ^Epistle to Cangrande~ is modesty 
itself in dealing -- or not dealing -- with this verse, which is 
glossed over quickly, avoiding any confrontation with the enormous 
claim being made here (^Epist~. XIII.86).  Apollo is a familiar 
Christian analogue for Christ (for later manifestations of this 
medieval tradition in Calder$on, see Ernst Robert Curtius, ^European 
Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W. R. Trask [New York: 
Harper & Row, 1963 {1948}], pp. 245, 568) and here it is perhaps the 
Second Person of the Trinity that first shines through to the reader as 
the dominant Person present in these lines (see Giacalone, comm. ^Par~. 
I.20-21: "here Apollo is a figure of Christ").  As we shall see, the 
other two Persons are both referred to, clearly if obliquely.

	|16-18.~  This tercet explains its predecessor (i.e., why the poet 
feels he must turn to "the Delphic god" [^Par~. I.32] now), although it 
is fair to say that elements in it have remained a puzzle through the 
centuries.  If previously he has not needed to appeal directly to a 
higher authority for inspiration, relying only on the Muses, Dante now 
turns to the god himself.  Whatever the meanings and references of the 
details put before us here, almost every commentator agrees that this 
is their basic significance.

Dante, however, is apparently confused about the configuration of the 
actual Mt. Parnassus in Greece.  See Tozer's explanation (1901, comm. to 
this tercet) of this material (which Dante borrows, without perhaps 
recognizing the problem he inherits in doing so, from his Latin 
precursors): "That mountain rises to a single conspicuous summit; and 
when the Greek poets speak of its two summits (Soph., ^Ant~. 1126; 
Eurip., ^Bacch~. 307; cp. ^Ion~. 86-8) they mean, not the real summit 
of the mountain, but the two peaks that rise above Delphi, which are 
several thousand feet lower.  These expressions were misunderstood by 
the Roman poets, who regularly describe Parnassus as rising to two 
summits; e.g., Ovid, ^Metam~. I.316-317, 'Mons ibi verticibus petit 
arduus astra duobus, Nomine Parnassus' [There Mount Parnassus lifts its 
two peaks skyward, high and steep -- tr. F.J. Miller]; Lucan, ^Phars~. 
V.72, 'Parnassus gemino petit aethera / colle' [the twin peaks of 
Parnassus soar to heaven -- tr. J.D. Duff].  Dante followed them, and 
naturally fell into the same mistake."

Further, Isidore of Seville (^Etym~. XIV.viii.11), perhaps reflecting 
texts in Servius (on ^Aen~. VII.641 and X.163, i.e., at the two 
appearances of the word "Helicon" in the ^Aeneid~), says that the names 
of the peaks were Cyrrha and Nissa, but adds that they were also named 
after the two brothers Cithaeron and Helicon.  Since Helicon is another 
mountain entirely, certain confusions have resulted; it is difficult to 
be certain exactly what Dante here means to indicate.  Did he, 
conflating Parnassus (associated with Apollo) and Helicon (associated 
with the Muses), believe (or decide) that the two peaks of Parnassus 
"belonged" to Apollo and to the Muses, respectively, i.e., Cyrrha and 
Helicon?  Here is Tozer again: "In fact, the only passage which may be 
taken to imply this is found in the ^Scholia in Bucolica et Georgica~ 
attributed to Probus the Grammarian (^Georg~. III.43), and there is no 
reason to suppose that Dante knew that work."  Thus, even if we cannot 
be sure of what Dante knew or invented about the actual mountain, that 
possibility is perhaps the best one we have to explain the passage -- 
if with caution.  And see Paratore, "Il canto I del ^Paradiso~," in 
^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. V (Florence: Le Monnier, 1972), pp. 
273-74, for a possible Lucanian source for Dante's version of Cyrrha 
(^Phars~. V.93-96), a passage which, in Dante's eyes, might have 
represented Lucan's version of the Empyrean (since the caves of Cyrrha 
are closely linked with heaven-dwelling Jupiter [^tonans~]).

Nonetheless, if Dante knew what many of his commentators, from the 
earliest through those of the last century, report at verse 16 (e.g., 
the Ottimo, Pietro di Dante, the author of the ^Chiose ambrosiane~, 
Benvenuto, the Anonimo Fiorentino, John of Serravalle, Lombardi, 
Portirelli, Tommaseo, Scartazzini, Campi), namely, that Cyrrha was 
sacred to Apollo, Nissa to Bacchus, how could he have made the second 
"peak" of Parnassus sacred to the Muses?  At ^Purg~. XXIX.37-42, 
Dante's second invocation of that ^cantica~ makes reference to the 
Heliconian residence of the Muses.  However, two other passages in 
^Purgatorio~ (^Purg~. XXII.65 and XXXI.141) make oblique reference to 
the Castalian spring on Mt. Parnassus as also being home to these 
ladies.  It does seem possible that Dante has deliberately conflated 
two homes of the Muses, the spring on Parnassus with that on Helicon 
(which Dante may not have known as a mountain but as itself a spring 
[Toynbee, "Elicona" {^Concise Dante Dictionary~}]).

On the other hand, still another (and even more attention-catching) 
passage in Lucan may lie behind some of the apparent confusion in 
Dante's account.  Here is the conclusion of the pseudo-dedication 
(^Phars~. I.33-66) of the unfinished epic to the emperor, Nero:
		
   Sed mihi iam numen; nec, si te pectore vates
   accipio, Cirrhaea velim secreta moventem
   sollicitare deum Bacchumque avertere Nysa:
   tu satis ad vires Romana in carmina dandas.  (^Phars~. I.63-66)

   But to me you are divine already; and if my breast receives
   you to inspire my verse, I would not care to trouble the god
   who rules mysterious Delphi, or to summon Bacchus from Nysa:
   you alone are sufficient to give strength to a Roman bard (tr. J.D.  Duff).

Three remarks seem called for.  (1) It is inconceivable that Dante 
would not have paid close attention to this passage, loaded as it is 
with Lucan's poetic and political strategies that inform the entire 
work.  Thus he might have noted that his favorite republican 
poet/historian has situated Apollo and Bacchus, as was only to be 
expected in the Latin tradition, on the two "peaks" of Parnassus.  Or, 
since Lucan is assuming his reader's knowledge of these matters, 
perhaps Dante did not understand that the passage referred to 
Parnassus, even with its reference to Nysa (although he surely might 
have known that this was one of the "peaks" of Parnassus).  (2) 
Whatever his understanding of the geography of the passage, he surely 
understood the only slightly veiled reference to Apollo, to whom he 
himself will refer in only a few lines as "the Delphic god" (verse 32). 
 What may we imagine Dante thought as he reconsidered Lucan's proemial 
passage (he will later refer to the poem as "scriptura paganorum" 
[^Epist~. XIII.63], a phrase that may be neutral, meaning only "the 
writings of the pagans" or that may carry a biblical overtone: "pagan 
scripture")?  In contrast with his own proem to ^Paradiso~, he notes 
that Lucan does not "invoke" Apollo, as Dante has done (vv. 13-21), but 
treats the emperor, Nero, as his muse -- no matter how playfully.  Thus 
Dante does invoke Apollo by name if not in fact, while Lucan apparently 
bypasses him for the emperor (already semi-divine, in Lucan's 
devastatingly overstated obsequiousness); the reversals of our 
expectations are, in both cases, stunning.  (3) If Dante's invocation 
of Apollo is a response to Lucan's non-invocation in the proem to the 
^Pharsalia~, he must have realized that the "orthodox" companion on the 
"orthodox" companion peak was Nissa-based Bacchus and not the 
Castalian-spring-dwelling Muses.  And thus we would observe yet another 
example of his bold and sure reshaping of pagan myth to his own 
Christian purpose.  See, for a discussion of this complicated example 
of Dantean-Lucanian intertextuality, Violetta De Angelis, "... e 
l'ultimo Lucano," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia: Autorit@a 
e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci (Ravenna: Longo, 1993), pp. 
183-95. 
De Angelis, however, believes that Dante ^does~ think of Bacchus, god 
of eloquence, as having guided him this far (p. 194), a judgment 
difficult to accept, given the fact that the first four invocations in 
the poem were all Muse-directed (see discussion of the invocations in 
the note to ^Par~. I.1-36).

	|18.~  For the phrase "m'@e uopo," here translated "I need," see 
Landino (comm. to vv. 16-18): "chome in latino diciamo 'mihi est opus'" 
(as in Latin we say, "I have this to do").

The word ^aringo~ (here translated loosely and, in reverse metonymy, as 
"struggle") actually descends from a Gothic word referring to the space 
in which troops were gathered (and subsequently a contest took place) --
see Giacalone (comm. to ^Par~. I.16-18).  The English "ring" 
(definition 13 in the ^OED~) offers, if not perhaps a true cognate, a 
useful analogue, as in the phrase "I would not get into the ring with 
him, if I were you."

	|19.~  In this second piece of his invocation proper (in the first, at 
verse 14, he had asked to be made God's vessel), the poet asks to be, 
literally, inspired ("Come into my breast and breathe in me").  If the 
first petition seems to have been aimed in particular at the Second 
Person of the Trinity, Christ as Apollo, this one seems to be directed 
to the Holy Spirit, as has been the case in the ^Comedy~ when Dante has 
represented inspiration, reflecting the "spiration of the Holy Spirit" 
(e.g., see the notes to ^Inf~. XXXIII.106-108 and ^Purg~. XXIV.52-54).  
And now see Picone, "Il tema dell'incoronazione poetica in Dante, 
Petrarca e Boccaccio," ^L'Alighieri~ 25 (2005), pp. 10-11.

	|20-21.~  If the reader has accepted the possibility (even the 
likelihood) that Dante's guarded speech is to be unriddled as an 
invocation of Christian dimension and scope, these next two verses seem 
to undo such a formulation with a certain exigency, for the story of 
Marsyas does not seem to lend itself to such understandings (but see 
the similar treatment of Apollo discussed in the note to ^Par~. I.13). 

Dante probably did not have access to the fragmentary accounts knit 
together to make the story of Marsyas that modern readers can find in 
various ^compendia~.  The pre-history of Marsyas was, if known to him, 
interesting.  Minerva, having invented the wind instrument that we know 
as the flute or Pan-pipes, saw herself, playing it, reflected in water 
and noticed how ugly the exercise made her face.  She hurled it away, 
only to have it picked up by Marsyas, who found that he quickly learned 
the skill to make his tunes.  He became so convinced of his ability 
that he challenged Apollo to a musical contest (cf. those similar 
Ovidian challengers of the gods' aesthetic abilities, the daughters of 
King Pierus [^Purg~. I.9-12] and Arachne [^Purg~. XII.43-45]).  
Naturally, Apollo and his lyre outdo Marsyas and his flute.  Since each 
combatant was to have his will if victorious, Apollo flays Marsyas 
alive (presumptuous mortals are always taught their lesson by the 
Ovidian gods whom they offend, but never seem to learn it).  Ovid's 
account (in the sixth book of the ^Metamorphoses~) of the early stages 
of the myth are brief (vv. 383-386 [he spends the core of his account, 
vv. 387-391, on the flaying in graphic detail and then, in the quieter 
conclusion, vv. 392-400, on the sadness of Marsyas's fellow fauns and 
satyrs at his death and transformation into the clearest stream in 
Phrygia]).  He is a satyr defeated in a contest by Apollo on Minerva's 
rejected reed and punished by the god; but do we not catch a glimpse in 
him of a potentially failed Dante, his vernacular a low instrument 
contrasted with the lofty Apollonian lyre?  In the account of Marsyas's 
punishment that Dante knew best (^Metam~. VI.383-400), his musical 
instrument has evidently humble origins: it is a reed (^harundo~ [verse 
384]) such as a yokel might pluck to make a tuneful sound; it is also a 
flute (^tibia~ [verse 386]).  Thus, along with presenting in Marsyas a 
coded figure of the poet as ^vas electionis~, Dante also would seem to 
encourage us to fashion a further understanding: As Marsyas, he is a 
proponent of the comic muse, of the low style, against the higher forms 
of artistry intrinsically represented by Apollo, the flute vs. the 
lyre.  We have learned to read Dante's controversial 
self-identifications with a certain ingenuity.  At one remove, he 
goes out of his way (and we readily follow him with great relief) to 
show that he is ^not~ at all like Uzzah (see the note to ^Purg~. 
X.56-57) or, for that matter, Arachne (see the note to ^Purg~. 
XII.43-45).  On the other hand, we never rid ourselves of the suspicion 
that the poet is also confessing that he, secretly, for all his 
protestation by the use of contrary exemplars, acknowledges precisely 
his resemblance to these outlaws, these challengers of divine 
authority, these chafers at divine constraint upon human knowledge and 
capacity.  Ovid's Marsyas is the opposite of Dante's, who has been 
turned inside out, as it were.  See Jessica Levenstein's succinct 
remark ("The Re-Formation of Marsyas in ^Paradiso~ I," ^Dante for the 
New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New York: 
Fordham University Press, 2003], p. 412): "While Ovid portrays the 
god's removal of the skin from the satyr, Dante describes the god's 
removal of the satyr from the skin."

From Apollo's perspective, Marsyas is a bumpkin who deserves to be 
roundly punished; from Dante's, he is the classical equivalent of a 
poet working in the low vernacular, and thus a more enigmatic presence. 
 Dante's God, unlike Apollo, rewards humble singers with true vision 
accomplished in a rapture of the soul, drawn from its body (even though 
we have reason to acknowledge that Dante is in the heavens 
corporeally).  For an appreciation of Dante's ringing of the changes on 
Ovid's Apollo/Marsyas relationship, see Marguerite Mills Chiarenza, 
"Pagan Images in the Prologue of the ^Paradiso~," in ^Proceedings, 
Pacific Northwest Council on Foreign Languages~ 26 (1975): Part 1, 
133-36.

For a a discussion relevant to the generic concerns of the poet as he 
began composing his ^Paradiso~, see Manlio Pastore Stocchi, "Dante, 
Mussato, e la traged@ia," in ^Dante e la cultura veneta~, ed. V. Branca 
and G. Padoan (Florence: Olschki, 1966), pp. 251-62.  He examines the 
complex and interrelated questions of Dante's (1) knowledge of 
Albertino Mussato's thoughts about Senecan tragedy (in Mussato's 
^Evidentia tragediarum Senece~ [written before 1313]), (2) awareness of 
the definition of tragedy as being Senecan in nature, as promulgated by 
Uguccione da Pisa, (3) acquaintance with the actual tragedies of Seneca 
(i.e., of an author distinct from the "Seneca morale" of Inf. IV.141), 
(4) desire to distance himself, in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~ (which 
Pastore Stocchi does not hesitate to consider Dantean in origin), from 
Mussato's definitions, (5) "coded" rejection of Mussato's tragic 
poetics (and embrace of his own comic ones) in his first eclogue in 
response to Giovanni del Virgilio (^Egl~. I.47).

	|22-24.~  Apollo now becomes God the Father, addressed by the first of 
his Trinitarian attributes, Power.   His highest creation, the 
Empyrean, is referred to as the "kingdom," of which Dante hopes to be 
allowed to retain a weak but true copy in his mind; he will bring that 
back and write it down for us.  The phrase "l'ombra del beato regno" 
(the shadow of the bless@ed kingdom -- verse 23) reflects the Latin 
technical term ^umbra~ found in discussions of figure and fulfillment 
in biblical exegesis.  See Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: 
Longo, 2002]), pp. 302-3; Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 196-97; Hollander 
("^Paradiso~ XXX," ^Studi Danteschi~ 60 [1988 {=1993}]): 19-21; Ledda 
("^T$opoi~ dell'indicibilit@a e metaforismi nella ^Commedia~," 
^Strumenti critici~ 12 [1997]): 137.

	|25-27.~  The language here admits of two referential fields; in the 
Ovidian one the tree is Apollo's laurel, to which Dante comes to crown 
himself with its leaves, as his subject and the god himself shall make 
him worthy.  However, poets are not usually portrayed as crowning 
themselves.  Perhaps that is a clue to our necessary radical 
transformation of the pagan myth as it applies to Dante.  In the 
Christian version of the myth, Apollo is Christ (see the note to ^Par~. 
I.13-15), whose "tree" (the cross) the Christian poet approaches to 
gather to himself the Christian version of the laurel wreath, the 
immortality won for humankind by Christ, which his poem and Christ's 
love will make him worthy to receive.  In this vein see Goffis ("Canto 
I,"  in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1968 {1964}], pp. 1-36): "E cos@i il 'diletto legno,' a cui si 
rivolger@a Dante, @e certo l'alloro, ma @e anche il ^lignum crucis~, e 
le foglie d'alloro non saranno segno di gloria terrena soltanto" (And 
thus the "beloved tree," to which Dante shall address himself, is, to 
be sure, the laurel, but it is also the wood of the cross; and the 
laurel's leaves shall not be a sign of earthly glory alone).  In 
Dante's world, however, as the next tercet will make clear, there are 
none or few who even long for such reward.

The word ^legno~ occurs in nineteen passages in the poem, nine times as 
metonymic for "ship," seven times to mean "tree," twice to mean "a 
piece of wood," and once to refer to the cross, the "tree" to which 
Jesus was nailed (^Par~. XIX.105).

	|28-33.~  Far from worrying about not having enough laurel leaves to 
accommodate all those worthy of them (intrinsically the condition in 
earlier times, i.e., classical ones), Dante's Apollo must take joy 
whenever, in this leaden age, ^anyone~, no matter how undeserving, 
desires to be crowned with the leaves of "the Peneian bough," i.e., 
those of the laurel (or bay-tree), in Daphne's transformed state; 
Daphne's father, god of a Thessalian river, was named Peneus, and the 
river after him.  See, as Scartazzini (comm. ^Par~. I.31-33) suggests, 
Ovid (^Metam~. I.452): "Primus amor Phoebi Daphne Peneia" (Apollo's 
first love, Peneus's daughter, Daphne).

	|29.~  Dante abruptly broadens the subject area to include emperors 
along with poets.  Since, up to now (vv. 9-27), the focus has been 
exclusively on poetry, it comes as something of a surprise to find the 
imperial crown beneath our gaze, no matter how usual the reference to 
both laureations may be in our minds.  Dante's sense of himself as 
political poet may account for this expansion; nothing else in the 
immediate context would seem to do so.

Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni dantesche: "Fiore", "Monarchia", 
"Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003]), pp. 43-62, in a complex and 
perhaps not eventually convincing argument, would place the completion 
of the second ^cantica~ soon after the coronation (29 June 1312) of 
Henry VII of Luxemburg (^Purg~. XXXIII.37-45, the prophecy that some 
take to refer to Henry) and of ^Paradiso~ I-V by the end of 1313.  In 
Palma's further calculations, ^Monarchia~ was written soon after the 
completion of these ^canti~, at least by the end of 1314, and only 
then, beginning in the second half of 1315, ^Paradiso~ VI and the rest 
of the ^cantica~.  This dating might help explain the sudden Ghibelline 
outburst, which characterizes Canto VI, a canto that then, with its 
confirmation of the lasting validity of the imperial ideal, becomes a 
kind of continuation of ^Monarchia~ and a considered response to the 
death of Henry VII on 24 August 1313.  But see Anthony Cassell (^The 
"Monarchia" Controversy: An Historical Study with Accompanying 
Translations of Dante Alighieri's "Monarchia," Guido Vernani's 
"Refutation of the 'Monarchia' Composed by Dante," and Pope John XXII's 
Bull "Si fratrum"~ [Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America 
Press, 2004], p. 340), arguing that 1314 can only be a ^terminus a quo~ 
for the ^Monarchia~, not, as Palma would have it, p. 45, a ^terminus 
post quem~.

	|34.~  Arianna Punzi, "'Oh Beatrice, dolce guida e cara!' (^Paradiso~ 
XXIII, v. 34)," ^Critica del testo~ 2 (1999): 771-99, sees this line as 
an example of "false modesty"; however, the line reads more ordinarily 
as modesty itself ("the smallest spark leaps from a great fire"), a 
reading that is ridiculous and thus never attempted (how could Dante 
say the ^Commedia~ was "a small spark"?).  On the other hand, normal 
grammatical usage would point in that direction.  This is not to 
suggest that Dante wanted us to read the verse that way, but that when 
we do (as he surely knew we would in our first reading of the verse, 
before we discard that reading as impossible), we excuse him from the 
potential sin of pride.  Nonetheless, it is clear that his little spark 
is meant to kindle a vast flame in us.  That, however, is not 
necessarily to be understood as a prideful thought, when we consider 
the matter in light of the given of this poem (namely, that it is 
derived directly from God in order to help us to pray better), rather 
the completion of a chosen poet's duty.

It is interesting to come upon the line "Gran foco nasce di poca 
favilla" (a great flame is born of a small spark) in a sonnet of Cino 
da Pistoia (CLXX.12, ed. Marti).  The first to call attention to the 
resemblance was apparently Francesco Torraca (comm. ^Par~. I.34-36).  
We perhaps will never know which poet was responding to the other, as 
is frequently the case in this poetic relationship between two friends. 
 For instance, Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni dantesche: "Fiore", 
"Monarchia", "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003], p. 44-45) argues that, 
in his lament for the dead emperor, Henry VII, Cino is echoing a 
passage in the first canto of ^Paradiso~ (^Par~. I.22-27).  However, it 
seems at least as likely that Dante is echoing Cino -- if there is any 
link between the two passages at all (the fact that the main evidence 
is a series of three rhymes probably dilutes the case for a borrowing, 
since rhyming is a case apart in studies of poetic dependence, one with 
special ground rules and requiring special care).

	|35-36.~  The translation is based on an interpretation that may strike 
those who know the commentary tradition as erroneous (but see Hollander 
["Why Did Dante Write the ^Comedy~?" ^Dante Studies~ 111 {1993}: 20-21 
and ^Dante's Epistle to Cangrande~ {Ann Arbor: University of Michigan 
Press, 1993}, p. 91].  These verses are usually (nearly universally) 
interpreted to refer to other ^better~ poets who will be inspired to 
write by reading Dante (and who, because of his example, will have even 
more success in finding Apollo's favor).  Michelangelo Picone has in 
fact suggested  ("Canto XIV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, 
ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], 
p. 212n.) that Cino da Pistoia may be one such.  And even the generally 
skeptical Scartazzini (comm. ^Par~. I.35) falls victim to a probably 
unwise spirit of unanimity, although he is plainly uncomfortable with 
the portrait of the poet that results from this interpretation.  
"Troppa umilt@a" (overabundant humility) is his muttered response.  
Indeed, the very notion that Dante might envision the possibility that 
a single other poet (much less a whole crowd) might outdo him in poetic 
accomplishment seems nothing less than preposterous.  In the later 
twentieth century, several commentators have tried another solution, 
one that is first reflected in the commentary tradition when Daniele 
Mattalia (comm. ^Par~. I.35 -- as also would Giovanni Fallani [^Par~. 
I.34-36]) cites Giuseppe Toffanin's remarks (^Sette interpretazioni 
dantesche~ [Naples: Libreria scientifica editrice, 1947], pp. 80-82), 
even though he does not agree with them, that try to make the case for 
the saints in Heaven, including Beatrice, as being those whose prayers 
will be amended by Dante's poem.  That also seems a strained 
interpretation, since self-interested prayer is a necessary instrument 
only for those who are on earth, not yet experiencing their salvation.  
Nonetheless, the view impressed Rocco Montano (^Storia della poesia di 
Dante~, vol. II [Naples: Quaderni di Delta, 1963], p. 321, enough to 
make its way to print yet again and, through him, in 1968, to Giuseppe 
Giacalone (comm. ^Par~. I.34-36).  This minority position, however, 
does not hold up very well to scrutiny, either, though it is a welcome, 
if belated, response to the standard, if unlikely, gloss.  There is a 
"third way," fortunately, of solving the problem; see Hollander, "The 
'miglior voci' of ^Paradiso~ 1.35,"  ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante 
Society of America~ (November 2005) and "^Paradiso~ I.35-36: 'con 
miglior voci / si pregher@a perch$e Cirra risponda,'" ^Letteratura 
italiana antica~ 7 (2006): 241-47.  Literally, the verses seem to 
express the (not immodest) hope that the ^Comedy~ will help those who 
will read it to pray more effectively (and thus put themselves in the 
way of salvation -- that would seem to be the necessary conclusion).  
It is no wonder that for centuries most of Dante's readers avoided 
recognition of the barely hidden daring in such religious claims as 
this.  But it seems the simplest explanation of these verses, one that 
is in harmony with the avowed aim of this poet, which is to move those 
living in the bondage of the sins of this life toward the liberty of 
eternal glory (see ^Epist~. XIII.21).
The literal sense of ^si pregher~ is surely better rendered as
"pray."  Had Dante wanted to say what most of his interpreters want him
to have said, he could just as easily (and with the same rhythm) written
"si canter"; that is how, for centuries, commentators and translators
have rendered the phrase.  In fact, Dante uses the verb ^cantare~
("to sing") nearly seventy times in the poem, almost always to represent
poetic utterance.  And readers also may note that other forms of the
verb ^pr[i]egare~ and its related nouns, ^pr[i]ego~ and
^preghiera~, are not problematic in their more than sixty other
appearances, always either specifically signifying prayer or, more
generally, urgent request.  Thus one has the sense that this defensive
interpretation represents yet another example of avoidance behavior on
the part of those who wish to shun a theological reading of a passage,
trying to protect poor Dante from himself.

See the similar dispute that dogs a similar passage, ^Paradiso~ XXX.34 
(and the note to that verse).

We have translated verse 35 in a way that is not usual, sharing the 
understanding of such as Isidoro Del Lungo (comm. ^Par~. I.34-36), 
Mario Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia 
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 6, and 
Selene Sarteschi ("Canto I," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, 
ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002]), 
p. 17n., that ^di retro a me~ has less to do with time (as the vast 
majority of commentators take the phrase to do) -- if it does surely 
imply sequence -- than it does with imitation.  Del Lungo: 
"sull'esempio mio" (after my example); Aversano: "seguendo il mio 
esempio" (following my example).  Sarteschi is also in this camp, 
hearing an echo of ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.59, "di retro al dittator"; Dante 
will become the new "dictator" -- for other poets we assume -- but 
Sarteschi is not eventually clear about her interpretation of this 
line.  We part company from both her precursors once they continue 
their analysis; for Del Lungo and his followers, those who will follow 
Dante in prayer are the blessed in Heaven (see discussion earlier in 
this note); Aversano, while disagreeing with that argument (as well as 
with the previously ruling hypothesis, that other [and superior poets] 
would succeed Dante in writing religious poetry), offers an at least 
equally unlikely solution: these favored ones are the emperor and/or 
other practitioners of imperial politics.

	|37-45.~  This long and difficult beginning of the narrative portion of 
the final ^cantica~ may be paraphrased as follows: The Sun ("the lamp 
of the world") rises on us mortals from various points along the 
horizon, but from that point at which four circles intersect in such a 
way as to form three crosses (generally understood as the circles of 
the horizon, the equator, the zodiac, the colure of the equinoxes, the 
last three of which intersect the horizon in this way on the vernal 
equinox, March 21), it comes forth conjoined with a better 
constellation (Aries) and takes a better course, and it better tempers 
and imprints the material compound of the world with its informing 
power.  And from that point on the horizon it had made morning there, 
where almost all was light (Purgatory), and evening here, where almost 
all was dark (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere). As Bosco/Reggio 
(comm. ^Par~. I.37-42) point out, Dante has marked the beginnings of 
all three ^cantiche~ with references to the time (^Inf~. II.1-5; 
^Purg~. I.13-30, 115-117).  Singleton refines the point (comm. 
^Par~. I.44-45): Where ^Inferno~ begins at evening (around 6 pm) and 
^Purgatorio~ at dawn (shortly before 6 am), ^Paradiso~ begins, more 
propitiously, at noon, the most "noble" hour of the day (see ^Purg~. 
XXXIII.104 and ^Conv~. IV.xxiii.15).  And see the note in Bosco/Reggio 
to the following tercet (vv. 43-45) for some of the elaborate exegesis 
attached to the astronomical problems here.  For a detailed discussion 
in English, see Alison Cornish, ^Reading Dante's Stars~ (New Haven: 
Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 87-92.  The passage (vv. 37-54, in 
fact) offers numerous examples of ^enjambement~ in two (and more) 
successive ^terzine~.  See Paratore, "Il canto I del ^Paradiso~," in 
^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. V (Florence: Le Monnier, 1972), pp. 
266-67, who points out that the first canto of the ^Paradiso~ is 
particularly marked by this phenomenon, which he counts as occurring a 
total of nine times, much more than is usual.

	|46-48.~ The lengthy opening description of the heavens yields to the 
first presence and first naming of Beatrice in ^Paradiso~.  Her 
superhuman ability to gaze directly and fixedly at the Sun reflects a 
tradition insisting on eagles' ability to do so found in Aristotle 
among the ancients (^Animal~. IX.xxxiv) and in Brunetto Latini among 
the moderns (^Tresor~ I.v.8).  And see ^Par~. XX.31-32.  As Carroll 
points out (comm. ^Par~. I.49-64), we probably should not draw 
allegorical conclusions about Beatrice's turning leftward (a movement 
frequently symptomatic, in this poem, of moral deficiency); here her 
turning in this direction is necessitated by her being in the Southern 
Hemisphere, where she was facing east; north, whence the Sun shone, was 
thus to her left.

	|48.~  The noun ^aguglia~ is a popular form of the Latin/Italian word 
for "eagle."  For discussion of the linguistic mixture that is so 
important a feature of this canto, see Pompeo Giannantonio, "Canto I," 
in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio 
(Naples: Loffredo, 2000 [1986], p. 18).

	|49-54.~  This, the first formally developed simile of ^Paradiso~, is 
in fact double (and that its second element deploys the image of a 
completed pilgrimage should not surprise us).  We may sense an 
increasing degree of abstraction in the similes of this ^cantica~ (but 
not always -- see ^Par~. I.67-69, where Dante's "transhumanization" is 
cast in physical terms; he is changed as was Glaucus).  For the 
increasingly abstract nature of the poetry of roughly the first 
two-thirds of ^Paradiso~, see Fredi Chiappelli, "Abstraction et 
r$ealit$e dans la structure figurative du ^Paradiso~," in ^Le R$eel 
dans la litt$erature et dans la langue, actes du Xe congr@es de la 
F$ederation internationale des langues et litt$eratures modernes 
(F.I.L.L.M.), Strasbourg, 29 ao#ut-3 septembre 1966~, ed. Paul Vernois 
(Paris: C. Klincksieck, 1967, pp. 7-22).  And for two bibliographies of 
studies devoted to the Dantean simile, see Madison U. Sowell, "A 
Bibliography of the Dantean Simile to 1981," ^Dante Studies~ 101 (1983: 
167-80), and Juan Varela-Portas de Ordua, ^Introducci$on a la 
sem$antica de la "Divina Commedia": teor$ia y an$alisis del s$imil 
~(Madrid: Ediciones de la Discreta, 2002).

Beatrice's miraculous (to ordinary mortals) ability to look into the 
Sun is momentarily granted to Dante, who sees the reflection of the Sun 
in her eyes and somehow is able to look up into that planet with his 
returning gaze.  When we reflect that, according to ^Purgatorio~ IV.62, 
the Sun itself is a mirror (^specchio~), Beatrice then becomes a mirror 
of the mirror of God.

	|53.~  For the ^imaginativa~, the image-receiving capacity of the 
brain, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.13-18.

	|55-57.~  Some of the early commentators make the understandable 
mistake (since "here" obviously refers to the earth) of thinking that 
"there" applies to the heavens and not the pinnacle of the mount of 
purgatory; however, both Benvenuto da Imola (comm. ^Par~. I.49-57) and 
Francesco da Buti (comm. ^Par~. I.49-63) comprehend that Dante and 
Beatrice are still in the earthly paradise, a fact that the title of 
this new ^cantica~ tends to make us forget.  Carroll (comm. ^Par~. 
I.49-64) senses that the protagonist is presented as the "new Adam," 
quoting St. Gregory of Nazianzus for the belief that "The head and aim 
of all the Christian mysteries is my perfection and restoration and 
return to the first Adam" and reminds us that this last scene situated 
on the purgatorial mount is occurring at the propitious time of noon 
(see the note to ^Par~. I.37-45).

	|58-60.~  Dante is able to make out the corona of the Sun.  The reader 
must assume that his greater sight results from his greater closeness 
to the Sun at this highest point on the earth's surface as well as from 
his regaining the vision of innocence (see the note to ^Par~. I.55-57).

	|61-63.~  Venturi (comm. ^Par~. I.62-63) believes that this additional 
brightness was caused by the sight of the Moon, now grown larger in its 
appearance because Dante is so much higher.  However (and as Lombardi 
[comm. ^Par~. I.61-63] correctly objects), this cannot be the sphere of 
the Moon, which awaits Beatrice and Dante in the next canto, but is the 
sphere of fire, in the outermost situation of the four elements that 
constitute our earth (water and earth, then air, and finally fire), a 
solution at first proposed in 1333 or so by the Ottimo (comm. ^Par~. 
I.58-63).  And see verse 115 of this canto ("This instinct carries fire 
up toward the moon"), where the sphere of fire is apparently again 
alluded to.  However, some ancient commentators (e.g., Benvenuto [comm. 
^Par~. I.58-63]) and some modern ones as well (e.g., Singleton [comm. 
^Par~. I.61-63]) deny this, the first insisting that Dante had passed 
this zone on the Mount of Purgatory, the second observing that Dante 
does not definitively refer to this important boundary of the earth's 
atmosphere, thus leaving the question unresolved.  However, Benvenuto 
either has conflated what Dante says about the limits of normal earthly 
weather to the ante-purgatorial precincts (see ^Purg~. XXI.41-60) with 
the location of the sphere of fire or he simply misconstrues details in 
the earthly paradise, since he claims that we frequently learn in that 
part of the poem that it is found lower down; as for Singleton's 
objection, this would not be the first time that Dante withholds 
information that we would like to have (e.g., how he entered Hell, how 
he crossed Acheron, etc., etc.) on the good ground that we would find 
such information simply too challenging to our already challenged 
credence in the givens of this poem.  He probably felt forced, since 
there are nine of them, to account for his passages through the 
boundaries that constitute the starry spheres; but he may have felt 
that he could finesse the sphere of fire, thus avoiding the need to 
explain how he passed through it unscathed (in contrast one thinks of 
the lengthy and detailed description of Dante's difficult passage 
through the wall of fire around the seventh terrace [^Purg~. 
XXVII.10-57]).

On this tercet see Carroll (comm. ^Par~. I.49-64): "'The light of the 
moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall 
be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord 
bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of the wound' 
(Isaiah 30:26).  This represents the vast increase of knowledge which 
would have come to Adam had he remained in his first estate, and which 
Dante receives because he has regained it, -- not the direct vision of 
the Divine Essence, but power to see the sparks which it flung forth -- 
its operations and effects in creation."

	|64-66.~  The guide and her charge apparently have passed through the 
(unnamed) sphere of fire that girds the earth just below the sphere of 
the Moon; Dante's eyes are guided by Beatrice's beyond this home of 
earth's highest-dwelling element and to a first sight of the heavenly 
spheres.

	|67-72.~  Glaucus's transformation, described by Ovid (^Metam~. 
XIII.904-968), is a dazzling rendition of how an ordinary fisherman, 
chancing upon a magic herb, is metamorphosed into a god of the sea.  
Dante can sharply reduce the poetic space he devotes to the Ovidian 
scene because it is so familiar to his readers (at least to the ones he 
most cares about).  For the classical history of Glaucus as it comes 
into Ovid, Dante's primary source, see Diskin Clay, "The Art of Glaukos 
(Plato ^Phaedo~ 108D4-9)," ^American Journal of Philology~ 106 (1985: 
230-36).

For Dante's Glaucus (along with Marsyas) as figures of Dante's own 
divinization, see Paola Rigo, ^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in 
Dante~ (Florence: Olschki, 1994, pp. 109-33).  For the theme of 
^deificatio~ in St. Bernard's ^De diligendo Deo~ as clarifying Dante's 
notion of "transhumanization," see Rosetta Migliorini-Fissi, "La 
nozione di ^deificatio~ nel ^Paradiso~," ^Letture classensi~ 9-10 
(1982: 39-72); she indeed sees traces of Bernard's work throughout the 
poem, as does Francesco Mazzoni, "San Bernardo e la visione poetica 
della ^Divina Commedia~," in ^Seminario Dantesco Internazionale: Atti 
del primo convegno tenutosi al Chauncey Conference Center, Princeton, 
21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z.G. Baranski (Florence: Le Lettere, 1997, 
esp. pp. 178-80, 192-230).

Kevin Brownlee, "Pauline Vision and Ovidian Speech in ^Paradiso~ I," in 
Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: 
Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Stanford: Stanford University 
Press, 1991, p. 213), suggests that the transformation of Marsyas 
figures the transformation of the poet, while that of Glaucus has the 
same function for the protagonist.  Manuele Gragnolati (^Experiencing 
the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 2005], p. 
173), is of the opinion that Dante wants us to conclude that, as 
Glaucus leapt into the sea with his body in Ovid's account (^Metam~. 
XIII.949-951), so the protagonist ascended in his flesh.  See 
Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1969), pp. 216-20, 228-29, for an examination of the 
Ovidian passage with particular emphasis on the special pertinence of 
its numerical components (nine and one hundred) for Dante.

	|68.~  For Glaucus's "tasting" of the grass that transforms him as 
"reversing" Adam's "tasting" of the forbidden tree (^Par~. XXVI.115), 
see Rigo, ^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in Dante~ (Florence: 
Olschki, 1994, p. 113).  The notion of Glaucus as Adam in his refound 
innocence goes well with that of Dante in his: see Carroll's 
observation, cited in the note, above, to ^Par~. I.55-57.  We observe 
here a conflation of Ovid's ^Heroides~, XVIII.160, a verse (cited by 
Rigo, p. 114) referring to Glaucus: "reddidit herba deum" (whom a plant 
once deified -- tr. H.C. Cannon).

The two major classical myths evoked in this canto, Apollo and Glaucus, 
along with the associated references to arrows and the ingestion of 
food, indicate the two main ways to understanding that we will hear 
about all through the ^cantica~, intellectual penetration and a more 
passive reception of the truth.

That Dante has turned to Ovid for three major myth/motifs in this canto 
(Apollo and Daphne/immortality; Apollo and Marsyas/being drawn out of 
one's bodily limits; Glaucus/transhumanization) would almost seem to 
indicate that, for Dante's purposes, Ovid's poem about the gods, 
transmogrified by Dante's Christian intellect into shadowy prefaces 
(see ^Par~. XXX.78) of a higher truth, is a more adaptable source than 
Virgil's martial epic for this more exalted and final component of the 
^Comedy~.  If, after our encounter with the first cantos of ^Paradiso~, 
we are of that opinion, we are not altogether incorrect.  However, if 
we believe that Virgil's text is no longer a valued source in the 
poem's most Christian precincts, we will eventually be disabused of 
this notion, particularly in Cantos XV and XXXIII.

	|70-72.~  For Dante "transhumanization" is the passing beyond normal 
human limits by entering into a state at least approaching that enjoyed 
by divinity. 	

Marguerite Mills Chiarenza, "The Imageless Vision and Dante's 
^Paradiso~," ^Dante Studies~ 90 (1972), p. 83, holds this passage up to 
Hugh of St. Cher's comparison of the difficulty of conveying one's 
"intellectual vision" to someone else to the difficulty of describing 
the taste of wine to one who had never experienced it.

See Rosetta Migliorini-Fissi, "La nozione di ^deificatio~ nel 
^Paradiso~," ^Letture classensi~ 9-10 (1982), pp. 41-44, for St. 
Bernard's relevant concept of ^deificatio~.

	|70.~  Dante's claim is lodged in self-conscious language that, in a 
single verse, includes an Italian neologism ^(trasumanar)~, literally 
"to transhumanate," an intransitive verb signifying "to become more 
than human," and a Latin phrase, ^per verba~ (in words).

	|73-75.~  This tercet reflects the Three Persons of the Trinity, one 
per verse (Power, Knowledge, Love); we also learn in a single line (75) 
how Dante and Beatrice move upward: drawn instantaneously by God 
Himself, not propelled gradually by themselves.

	|73.~  This citation of II Corinthians 12:3 has not escaped many 
commentators.  There Paul is not certain as to whether he was in body 
or not in his ascent through the heavens.  For his phrase "third 
heaven" as meaning, not the heaven of Venus, to which the phrase would 
ordinarily refer in Dante, but the highest part of God's kingdom, see 
St. Thomas (^ST~ II-II.175.3), r. to obj. 4 (cited from the online 
edition of the ^Catholic Encyclopedia~
[\<a href=\"\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/\"\"\>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/\</a\>]): 
"In one way by the third heaven we may understand something corporeal, 
and thus the third heaven denotes the empyrean (I Tim. 2:7; cf. ^ST~ 
I.12.11, ad 2), which is described as the 'third,' in relation to the 
aerial and starry heavens, or better still, in relation to the aqueous 
and crystalline heavens.  Moreover, Paul is stated to be rapt to the 
'third heaven,' not as though his rapture consisted in the vision of 
something corporeal, but because this place is appointed for the 
contemplation of the blessed.  Hence the gloss on II Corinthians 12 
says that the 'third heaven is a spiritual heaven, where the angels and 
the holy souls enjoy the contemplation of God: and when Paul says that 
he was rapt to this heaven he means that God showed him the life 
wherein He is to be seen forevermore.'"

On the Pauline stance of the poet here and elsewhere, see Joseph A. 
Mazzeo, "Dante and the Pauline Modes of Vision," ^Medieval Cultural 
Tradition in Dante's "Comedy"~ (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 
1960), pp. 84-110.  (And see his earlier book, ^Structure and Thought 
in the "Paradiso"~ [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1958], for a 
wider consideration of the poetics of this ^cantica~.)  Jeffrey Schnapp 
("Trasfigurazione e metamorfosi nel ^Paradiso~ dantesco," in ^Dante e 
la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki, 1988], pp. 273-92) 
relates the Pauline ^raptus~, the "disappearance" of Virgil, and the 
increased reliance upon Ovidian text as a reflection of a new 
"vertical" poetic in the ^Paradiso~.  See also the discussion of this 
verse by M.E. Dwyer, "Whether in the body or out of the body?" ^Spunti 
e Ricerche~ 11 (1995): 45-58.

See ^Paradiso~ XXVII.64-65, where St. Peter finally makes it plain that 
Dante is present, ascending through the heavens, in the flesh.  
Bosco/Reggio (comm. ^Par~. I.73-75) make the point that, since Dante 
eventually allows us to believe that he went up in body (they cite 
passages that are perhaps less decisive than that in ^Par~. XXVII, 
^Par~. XXI.11 and XXI.61), all this coy uncertainty has a main purpose: 
to give himself Pauline credentials, since Paul himself either cannot 
or will not say in what state he was during his rapture.  Gragnolati 
(^Experiencing the Afterlife~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University 
Press], 2005, pp. 162-74) joins those who believe that Dante contrives 
to make us see that he wants to be understood as having made this final 
ascent in the flesh.

	|74.~  For Dante's phrasing describing God's love as manifest in His 
creation, commentators beginning with Scartazzini (comm. ^Par~. I.74) 
have suggested the resonance of Boethius (^Cons~. II.m8.15), "coelo 
imperitans amor" (love governing the heavens).

	|75.~  God is portrayed as drawing Dante upward through His beam of 
light; whether the protagonist possesses physical weight or not, it is 
a spiritual force that lifts him, not a physical one.

	|76-81.~  If God loved the universe in creating it, it loves him back.  
These two tercets create a picture of the totality of God's spheres.  
Having created them in time, He also made eternal (sempiternal, as 
Dante rightly says, i.e., having a beginning but not an end) their 
desire to reunite themselves with Him.

	|78.~  The reference is pretty clearly to the "music of the spheres," 
that harmony created by the movement initiated by the love of the 
spheres themselves for God.  As early as the Ottimo (comm. ^Par~. 
I.76-81), students of the poem attributed the notion of the harmony of 
the spheres (as do other early commentators [see also Pietro1 on ^Par~. 
I.76-78; Benvenuto on ^Par~. I.82-84 -- including Macrobius in a more 
complete list of earlier sponsors of this phenomenon, Plato, Aristotle, 
Boethius, and others; Francesco da Buti on ^Par~. I.73-84; John of 
Serravalle on ^Par~. I.76-81]) to Macrobius's commentary to the 
Ciceronian ^Somnium Scipionis~ (for a brief overview of the vexed 
topic, the extent of Dante's knowledge of this early-fifth-century 
neoplatonist, see Georg Rabuse, "Macrobio," ^ED~ (1971.3), pp. 757-59 
[Rabuse enthusiastically supports the view that Dante knows both the 
^Somnium Scipionis~ and the ^Saturnalia~ well]).  And for an also brief 
but useful discussion of Macrobius as reader of Virgil, see E.R. 
Curtius, ^European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W. R. 
Trask (New York: Harper & Row, 1963 [1948], pp. 443-45).  Among the 
moderns, since Lombardi (1791, in his comm. to ^Par~. I.76-78), 
commentators have suggested the dependence here upon that concept; and, 
closer to our own time, Bosco/Reggio (comm. ^Par~. I.78) point out that 
it is clear that Dante refers to the so-called "music of the spheres," 
with its roots in Pythagorean and Platonic writings (perhaps best known 
to Dante by the passage in the ^Somnium Scipionis~ [Cicero's ^De re 
pub~. VI.18] that exhibits Latin forms of the two verbs found here, 
"temperi" [^temperans~] and "discerni" [^distinctis~]).  Such music is 
a pleasing notion, but all of Aristotle's three greatest commentators, 
Averro,es, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas, quash its possibility. 
 Dante, as poet, seems to like the idea well enough that he is willing 
to be its sponsor despite such firm and authoritative opposition, as 
indeed Benedetto Varchi, citing only Aristotle, remarked (comm. ^Par~. 
I.73-93).  Bosco/Reggio go on to point out that this reference to the 
music of the spheres is the only one found in ^Paradiso~, where all 
later music will be in the form of the singing of the saved and of the 
angels, less suspect musical forms, we might conclude.  Eddie Condon, a 
banjoist, describes the night sounds of music in Chicago's jazz area in 
1925, when King Oliver and Louis Armstrong were duelling cornetists, in 
terms that may remind a classicist of another kind of "natural" music, 
the Aeolian harp.  See Laurence Bergreen, ^Louis Armstrong: An 
Extravagant Life~ (New York: Broadway, 1997), p. 261: "Around midnight 
you could hold your instrument in the middle of the street and the air 
would play it."

	|79-81.~  Perhaps because humans are accustomed to seeing no measurable 
space-consuming object more vast than a lake or a sea, the poet 
compares the extended fire he saw in the sky to a watery body.  How we 
are to understand the exact nature of the phenomenon at which he gazed 
is not clear, although some believe (see the note to ^Par~. I.61-63) it 
is the fiery ring that surrounds the sphere of the Moon, a common 
fixture of medieval astronomy that would otherwise have remained 
unmentioned in the poem.  But there is simply no certainty in this 
matter.

	|82-84.~  Both the beautiful sound (the music of the spheres? [see the 
note to ^Par~. I.78]) and the brilliant and extended pool of light (the 
sphere of fire between the earth and Moon? [see the note to ^Par~. 
I.61-63]) increase Dante's intense desire to know their realities.  It 
will at least seem that Beatrice's answer (vv. 88-93) does little to 
answer either of Dante's questions in ways that we, earthlings like 
him, would consider satisfying.  However, it certainly does seem that 
the poet means us to be aware of our unslaked curiosity about the 
identity of these two heavenly phenomena.  An attractive hypothesis is 
that he means us to draw exactly these conclusions without having left 
himself open to attack by making extraordinary claims (e.g., "I passed 
through the sphere of fire and listened to the music of the spheres").

	|85-87.~  We learn definitively that Beatrice truly reads the 
protagonist's mind, a capacity that Virgil at times claimed, but was 
rarely, if ever, capable of demonstrating (see the notes to ^Inf~. 
XVI.115-123; ^Inf~. XXIII.25-30; and to ^Purg~. XV.133-135).  Her lips 
open in response before Dante's question has been voiced.  The reason 
for the agitation experienced by the protagonist is made clear by 
verses 82-84.

	|88-90.~  Beatrice avers that, were only Dante thinking in an 
otherworldly way, he would not have asked his two questions.  He thinks 
of what his senses are experiencing as though it were sensed on earth.  
Her point is that it is precisely his earthly home that he has left 
behind and is indeed racing from as quickly as lightning flies.  This 
response apparently does not satisfy readers' inquisitiveness much 
better than it satisfies the protagonist's.  On the other hand, 
Benvenuto da Imola (comm. ^Par~. I.91-93) suggests that the sounds of 
celestial harmony could not be heard from earth ("audit sonum coeli, 
non quia sit ibi factus de novo, sed quia dum staret in terra non 
poterat ipsum audire").  Thus Beatrice is intrinsically answering 
Dante's first question; his earthly ears confounded the reality (the 
music of the spheres) of what they heard.  As for the second, 
commentators, beginning perhaps with Lombardi in 1791 (comm. ^Par~. 
I.92), have understood that Dante's allusion is to the sphere of fire 
that circled the earth above the other elements, near the Moon; in 
other words, that Beatrice's words "lightning darting from its place" 
contain a specific reference to the sphere of fire, as is now 
recognized in most discussions of this tercet.

	|91-93.~  For a study devoted to the paradoxes that flow from Dante's 
combined corporeal heaviness and lightness, see Simon Gilson, 
"Rimaneggiamenti danteschi di Aristotele: ^gravitas~ e ^levitas~ nella 
^Commedia~," in ^Le culture di Dante. Atti del quarto Seminario 
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ (Florence: 
Cesati, 2004, pp. 170-73): Beatrice's words gather up and redeploy 
Aristotle's statements concerning the rapid and violent movement of 
celestial bodies (^De caelo~ II.2 and ^Meteor~. II.9), combining them 
with the views of St. Augustine (^Conf~. XIII.9) on the ^pondus 
amoris~, the downward-tending direction of earthly affection and the 
liberating fire of love for God.  (Both Sapegno [comm. ^Par~. 
I.124-126] and Singleton [comm. ^Par~. I.116] cite this passage from 
the ^Confessions~ to make a similar point.)  Dante's rational soul is 
returning to its "birthplace" in the heavens, where God breathed it 
into the being he was to become, his characteristics set by the Fixed 
Stars, as we learn, for instance at ^Par~. VIII.94-114).

	|94.~  Dante has conflated his two previous questions as one, since 
they have both been answered in the same way.

	|95.~  Beatrice's smiling words (^sorrise parolette~) here contain the 
first reference to smiles and smiling that run through this canticle.  
There are roughly twice as many references (two dozen) to smiling in 
^Paradiso~ as there were in ^Purgatorio~ (see the note to ^Purg~. 
II.83).

	|96-99.~  Dante's new question probably does not refer to a concern 
that will arise later (if he is in the body, as he plainly seems to 
believe he is, how can he pass through the matter of the planetary 
spheres? see ^Par~. II.37-45 and n.); rather, it more likely relates to 
his surprise that he in his bodied state can rise above, not only land 
and water back on earth but, far more puzzling to him, the lighter 
elements of air and fire.  In the view of the author of the ^Codice 
cassinese~ (comm. ^Par~. I.99) the reference is to two of the four 
elements: "scilicet. aerem et etherem, qui leves sunt respectu aliorum 
duorum corporum gravium ut est terra et aqua" (that is, air and fire, 
which are light in comparison to those other two bodies [elements] that 
are heavy, as are earth and water), a formulation that shows us a 
fourteenth-century commentator using the word ^corpo~ not to refer to 
the material heavenly spheres (as some modern commentators believe it 
must) but to the four elements.  For the identity of ^ether~ and 
^ignis~ see Guido da Pisa (comm. ^Inf~. XIV.52-60).

	|97.~  While rhyme may have forced the Latin verb ^requ,ievi~ (I was 
content), Dante surely enjoyed Latinizing his own speech as a character 
in his own poem (for the first [and last] time since his first word in 
the poem [^Inf~. I.65, ^Miserere~]).  He is, as his bibliography 
attests, a writer in vernacular ^and~ in Latin.

	|100-102.~  We have been made aware of the wonder of those in beatitude 
at the obtuseness of mortals at least since we first observed the angel 
finding the plight of Dante at the Gates of Dis of absolutely no 
interest (^Inf~. IX.100-103).  Introduced to this canticle at 
^Paradiso~ I.37 and I.116, the word ^mortale~ will recur on numerous 
occasions, and, in this sense (human, and thus intellectually flawed), 
at least another ten times in ^Paradiso~.  See ^Par~. II.53, IV.68, 
V.64, XI.1, XIX.99, XX.133, XXVIII.137, XXIX.132, XXXIII.32, XXXIII.68.

	|103-141.~  Beatrice's response fills the rest of the canto, with the 
exception of its final line of narrative.  It is divided into three 
parts.  In the first (^Par~. I.100-126), she deals with Dante's 
puzzlement as to his upward inclination, given his mortal condition; in 
the second (^Par~. I.127-135), she admits that fallen human nature is 
prone to being drawn downward, away from this true inclination; in the 
third (^Par~. I.136-141), she avers that Dante is now proof against 
such wrong directionality because he has been freed of sin.

	|103-105.~  While hardly answering Dante's question directly (^Par~. 
I.98-99: how can his heaviness pass through lighter zones in the 
atmosphere above the earth?), Beatrice begins her discourse on the 
nature of the universe, the formal disposition of which is ordered, in 
resemblance of its Creator.

	|106-108.~  In the structure of the created universe, where the divine 
form first became manifest, angels (and humans?) possess the capacity 
to understand that form.  The Scholastic word "form" is akin to the 
Platonic term "idea," a spiritual essence inhering in its physical 
manifestations.

	|109-120.~  Beatrice now presents the components of the universe's 
order: All things in nature, whether nearer to God or farther, have a 
natural inclination toward the good.  While their destinations differ, 
each responds to its own inborn impulse in finding its goal, whether 
fire (guided toward the lunar sphere), the sensitive soul in irrational 
creatures, the force of gravity in inanimate things -- and not only 
irrational things (animals, inanimate nature) but angels and humans as 
well.  Both these classes of being possess not only intellect but love; 
the latter, as Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. ^Par~. I.120) in the sense 
of "capable of willing," as in ^Purg~. XVII.92-93 ("amore... d'animo" 
[^love~, whether natural or ^of the mind~]).  

	|109-111.~  For a possible poetic precursor to Dante's formulation of 
the laws of gravity, see Ovid (^Metam~. I.29-30), as is pointed out by 
Antonio Rossini, ^Dante and Ovid: A Comparative Study of Narrative 
Technique~ (doctoral dissertation, University of Toronto, 2000), p. 
172.  The passage was first noted by Daniello (comm. ^Par~. I.109-111): 
"Densior his tellus, elementaque grandia traxit et pressa est gravitate 
sua" (the earth was heavier than these [the elements of fire and air], 
and, drawing with it the grosser elements, sank to the bottom of its 
own weight [tr. F.J. Miller]).  And see the note to ^Par~. I.91-93.

	|112-117.~  Reverting to nautical metaphor (see ^Par~. I.67-69) for the 
life-journeys of all created things, whether capable of willing or not, 
the poet equates the purposes of inanimate and one kind of animate life 
with voyages toward various ports, the ends for which He has ordained 
these of his creations.  This impulse is exemplified in three kinds of 
things: a light element (fire) with its inherent "desire" to rise to 
its own sphere (see the note to ^Par~. I.61-63); creatures possessed of 
an animal (but not a rational) soul; and a heavy element (earth) with 
its obedience to the law of gravity, expressed as a "desire" to become 
compacted (the opposite impulse from that of fire).

	|118-120.~  We now realize, if we did not at first, that "mortal 
hearts" did not refer to those of humans, in whom hearts are bound with 
immortal souls, guided by intellect and by choice in their loving 
(their will), but to the inclinations or instincts of animals,
guiding their actions.

	|121-126.~  It is God's plan that the Empyrean, bathed in His light, is 
unmoving, peaceful, while the uppermost and neighboring heaven, the 
Primum Mobile, itself most agitated, imparts motion to the other 
spheres below.  It is humans' eventual goal to be drawn toward God.

	|127-135.~  Dante, aware of our awareness that not all creatures 
possessed of immortal souls tend toward the good, explains why not all 
arrows hit their target.  The fault is not in the archer (God) but in 
the material (Beatrice switches metaphoric equivalence in mid-metaphor, 
moving from archery to the production of artifacts): some of the 
craftsman's work is faulty because of the innate shortcomings of his 
material.  It is a paradox that God's more noble creatures may swerve 
in their movement, while the lesser follow more predictable paths; that 
paradox results from the unique gift of freedom of the will to humans 
and to angels (see ^Par~. V.19-24).

	|136-141.~  Having offered the necessary philosophic background, 
Beatrice now more or less answers Dante's question: His natural 
inclination is to move upward.  To be sure, his quandary (^Par~. 
I.98-99) was how he, as an object possessing mass and weight, could 
penetrate matter, and this concern is not, strictly speaking, answered 
in her remarks so much as it is bypassed for a higher degree of 
abstraction.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Par~. I.141) set into relief the paradox that 
underlies these two ^terzine~.  While Dante's voyage through the 
heavens is itself miraculous in any terms, his upward tendency, which 
seems paranormal to him, is utterly natural; that he was called to 
witness, as was Paul, is a mystery that only God can explain; that, 
once called, he rises through the spheres is explained by the merest 
science, the result of a spiritual force of gravity, as it were.

	|142.~  The final verse of the canto, returning to the narrative mode, 
describes Beatrice's renewed contemplation of Heaven, to which she is 
obviously pleased to return, having had to lower her intellectual 
powers in order to explain what to her is intuited and obvious to such 
an auditor as Dante, with his as yet necessarily lesser capacity to 
experience and to understand the highest truths.
