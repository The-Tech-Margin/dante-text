	|1-15.~  If one were to select a single passage from the entire
^Commedia~ that seems most self-consciously wrought and thoroughly
marked by poetic exuberance, it might be difficult to find one more
fitting that description than this, with its opening mixture of Hebrew
and Latin, the mysterious "double light" glowing upon Justinian, the
sudden departure of that soul and his dancing fellows, the
protagonist's wild excitement in his bafflement over a theological
question, and, finally, the linguistic playfulness of the poet's
reference to Beatrice's name.  It is as though Dante were apologizing
in advance for the lack of poetic energy that typifies the rest of the
canto, turned over to the theological needs of its protagonist as
ministered to by his guide.

Canto VII almost seems to be offered as reassurance to readers with a
religious and/or theological bent that we've closed the books on Roman
history and Italian politics and now will stick to our good Christian
knitting - for a while, at least.  However, for the imperial resonances
in the opening three ^terzine~, see Giovanni Fallani ("Il Canto VII" in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989], pp. 224-27).

	|1-3.~  See Tozer's translation and note (comm. to vv. 1-3): "'Hosanna,
holy God of hosts, who by Thy brightness dost illuminate from above the
happy fires of these realms.'  These verses appear to have been Dante's
own, not a hymn of the Church; but they are in Latin, to correspond to
other mediaeval hymns.  ^malacoth~: as Dante required a rhyme for
^Sabaoth~ -- no easy thing to find -- he availed himself of the word
^malachoth~, which he met with in St. Jerome's Preface to the Vulgate,
where it is translated by ^regnorum~ (realms).  The proper form of
this, which is read in modern editions of the Vulgate, is ^mamlachot~,
but in Dante's time ^malachoth~ was the accepted reading."

For ^glossolalia~ ("speaking in tongues") as a concern to Dante, see
Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with understanding~,"
Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance
Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and
Studies, 1992)].  And see Giuseppe Di Scipio (^The Presence of Pauline
Thought in the Works of Dante~ [Lewiston, N.Y.: The Edwin Mellen Press,
1995], p. 281) for another assertion that ^Inferno~ VII.1 is a parodic
version of ^glossolalia~.  Sarolli, who almost gets credit for being
the first writer to connect, in an oppositional relation, the first
lines of this canto with those of the seventh canto of ^Inferno~,
^"Pape Sat@an, pape Sat@an, aleppe!"~ (^Prolegomena alla "Divina
Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp. 289-90), also unaccountably
urges a reader to understand that the macaronic passage includes, not
only Hebrew and Latin, but Greek.  (Tommaseo, in passing, does mention
^Inf~. VII.1 in conjunction with the opening of ^Par~. VII, thus
depriving Sarolli of an honor he merits, since Tommaseo makes no effort
to deal with the significance of the phenomenon he has observed.)

	|1.~  See the note to.^Paradiso~ V.1.  This is the third consecutive
canto that begins with a speaker's voice (rather than narration) and
the second consecutive canto to begin with the same speaker's voice,
both of these phenomena unique occurrences.

Justinian's first word of his last speech, ^Osanna~, has a history in
the poem: see ^Purgatorio~ XI.11 and XXIX.51.  After this appearance,
it also appears in ^Paradiso~ VIII.29; XXVIII.118; XXXII.135.  Its six
appearances make it the most present "foreign" word in the poem.  The
Ottimo hears its resonance from the shouts for the entry of Jesus into
Jerusalem (e.g., John. 12:13); Benvenuto, discussing (comm. to ^Par~.
VIII.22-30) the word's appearance in ^Paradiso~ VIII.29 has this to
say: "Ista vox hebraica significat immensam affectionem mentis quae non
potest bene exprimi graece vel latine" (This Hebrew word signifies
immense mental affection which cannot be properly expressed either in
Greek or in Latin).  The second Hebrew word in this line, ^saba@oth~,
is genitive plural "of the armies" (or "hosts," as Tozer translates, an
English version of Latin ^hostis~ [enemy], but without its sense of
opposition).

For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

	|3.~  God is depicted as shining down from above and illumining these
saved souls who, along with Justinian, have appeared to Dante in
Mercury in the moments before they withdraw from Dante's presence.

	|4-5.~  Justinian is now presented as a "substance," an irreducible
human soul, singing this holy song.  We perhaps now understand why
Dante has gone to such lengths to associate the emperor, inspired
keeper of the Roman laws, and himself, inspired poet of empire, in the
preceding canto (see ^Par~. VI.11; VI.23; VI.88); their tasks are not
dissimilar.

	|6.~  The neologism ^s'addua~ is problematic.  Readers are divided as
to what exactly the double light represents, and there are widely
various opinions.  Mazzoni ("Il canto VI del ^Paradiso~," ^Letture
classensi~ 9-10 [1982]: 142), suggests that these lights are, the one,
earthly, the other, heavenly, that is, the emperor's past and present
identities.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) are of the opinion that
the lights are of the warrior and of the legislator.  However, as we
have seen in the preceding canto, Justinian seems most eager to put the
military life behind him (^Par~. VI.25-27); thus it would be strange
for Dante to treat him in such wise.  And see Rachel Jacoff ("Sacrifice
and Empire: Thematic Analogies in San Vitale and the ^Paradiso~," in
^Renaissance Studies in Honor of Craig Hugh Smyth~, ed. Andrew Morrogh
^et al~. [Florence: Giunti Barb@era, 1985], pp. 323-24), arguing for
Virgil's phrase "geminas... flammas," the description of Augustus at
the helm during the battle of Actium, his brows casting a double flame,
as he is portrayed on the shield of Aeneas (^Aen~. VIII.680, part of
the same passage visited in the last canto: see the note to ^Par~.
VI.79-81).  That seems a promising lead to follow.  However, it would
probably be strange for Dante to have "borrowed" Augustus's identity
for Justinian.  There is also a possibility that Dante is thinking of
the passage in Acts 2:3-4 in which the apostles are given the gift of
^glossolalia~.  There appeared to them cloven tongues of fire; these
settled on each of them; they were then filled with the Holy Spirit and
began to speak such languages as the Spirit gave them to utter.  That
is possibly reflected in what has been occurring in the opening lines
of Canto VII; however, there may be a problem with the "dispertitae
linguae tanquam ignis," which may not be all that well described by the
phrase "doppio lume."

Bosco/Reggio point out that "s'addua" (inflected form of the verb
coined by Dante, ^adduarsi~) will soon be joined by such other
numerical coinages as ^incinquarsi~ (^Par~. IX.40) and ^intrearsi~
(^Par~. XIII.57).

	|8-9.~  Whereas the souls in the Moon may have been portrayed as
vanishing downward into the matter of that body (^Par~. III.122-123),
these pretty clearly travel a great distance upward very rapidly.
Dante has now got his logistics under control: the souls that appear in
the planets return to the Empyrean once they have completed their
mission, which is to instruct Dante.

	|10-12.~  This is the third and final time Dante uses repetitions of
the word ^d@i~ (see ^Purg~. XXXI.5 and ^Par~. V.122 for identical
paired presences of the imperative form of ^dire~) to give a greater
sense of intensity to a speaker's urging.  The first two times Beatrice
is speaking to the protagonist; now Dante speaks to himself, in
phrasing that is still more insistent.

The tercet, a dizzying display of alliteration (there are nine ^d~
sounds in three lines), also contains a possible pun.  Beatrice's
"sweet drops" in Italian ^(dolci stille)~ sound reasonably like
Bonagiunta's new sweet style (^dolce stil[e] novo~ [^Purg~. XXIV.57]),
which he attributes to Dante's poetry in praise of Beatrice.  The
likelihood of intention behind such a play on words is increased by the
presence of the same three rhymes later on in this canto, vv. 53-57
(^nodo~, ^ch'i' odo~, and ^modo~) as are found in ^Purgatorio~
XXIV.53-57.  These are the only two occurrences of these constituents
of ^terza rima~ in the poem; that they occur at the same numerical
placemarks (vv. 53, 55, 57) is hardly conclusive evidence, but doesn't
hurt the case, either.

	|12.~  For Dante's phrase "dolci stille" (sweet drops), see
Massimiliano Chiamenti (^Dante Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence: Le
Lettere, 1995], p. 178); see also Selene Sarteschi ("Sant'Agostino in
Dante e nell'et@a di Dante," in her ^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa
soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 {1999}], p. 186), indicating a possible
source in Augustine, ^Confessiones~ XIII.xxx.45: "Et audivi, domine
deus meus, et elinxi ^stillam dulcedinis~ ex tua veritate" (And I
heard, O Lord my God, and drank up a ^drop of sweetness~ out of Thy
truth [tr. E.B. Pusey] {italics added}).

	|13-15.~  In an exerted tercet, the poet says that he bowed his head,
under the sway of his devotion to Beatrice, just as does a man who nods
off to sleep.  For the same phrase, "t'assonna," see ^Paradiso~
XXXII.139.  There it precedes the vision of the Godhead, featuring the
miracle of the Incarnation.  It is perhaps not accidental that this is
a central subject in Beatrice's long disquisition that begins at verse
19 and runs the rest of the canto.

	|14.~  Surely what is meant is "any part of her name," but we may want
to reflect that the parts referred to just happen to be the first and
the last, mirroring, perhaps, the alpha and omega that represent God.
"Bice" was, of course, Beatrice's nickname (see ^Vita nuova~ XXIV.8,
the ninth line of the sonnet "Io mi senti' svegliar dentro a lo core":
"monna Vanna e monna Bice," where Dante observes Guido Cavalcanti's
lady, Giovanna, preceding his lady, Beatrice.)

	|18.~  Some commentators try to associate the ^foco~ with the fires of
Hell, but it seems more likely that Dante is saying that Beatrice's
smile had the power to calm even one who had been set on fire.  And see
^Purgatorio~ XXVII.10-54 for Dante's hesitant encounter with the
purging flames of the terrace of Lust.

	|19-24.~  Had not Justinian just spoken at even greater length, this
would have been the longest single speech in the poem, extending 130
lines from verse 19 to the end of the canto (148).  The passage
beginning here is described by Carroll (comm. to vv. 10-66) as "the
chief theological discourse in the ^Paradiso~."  All the rest of the
canto is, in fact, a Beatricean commentary on two passages in the
preceding canto, first (vv. 19-51) Justinian's presentation of Titus's
doing "vengeance for vengeance" in his destruction of Jerusalem (^Par~.
VI.91-93), second (vv. 52-120) his previous claim that Tiberius, by
having sovereignty when Christ was put to death (^Par~. VI.89-90), took
"vengeance" for God's wrath by presiding over the Crucifixion.  It is
interesting that Dante makes his two unusual choices for a short list
of the most significant Roman emperors the focus of Beatrice's
commentary in verse.

This stylistic ^tour de force~ (having Beatrice, presented playfully in
the fifth canto as the author of the poem [vv. 16-17], now reappear as
the commentator on two passages from the sixth canto) is not calculated
to set enthusiasts of lyric poetry aflutter.  ^Terza rima~ is about the
only thing poetic that we find in the rest of the canto, as Beatrice's
language is Scholastic-sounding and severe, her interests only
instructional, and correctively so.

	|19.~  The only other appearance of the word ^infallibile~ occurs in
^Inferno~ XXIX.56, where it modifies ^giustizia~.  Here Beatrice gives
her infallible (because she speaks with the authority of her Maker)
idea of the justness of God's vengeance, the "negative form" of his
justice, punishment.

	|20-21.~  For a consideration of the way in which Christ's prediction
of the fall of Jerusalem (Luke 19:36-46) and the city's conquest by the
Romans in A.D. 70 are reflected in this and other passages (and also
look forward to the coming punishment of Florence), see Ronald Martinez
("Dante's Jeremiads: The Fall of Jerusalem and the Burden of the New
Pharisees, the Capetians, and Florence," in ^Dante for the New
Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New York:
Fordham University Press, 2003], pp. 301-19).

	|20.~  The presence of two words directly related to "justice" in this
verse begins by far the largest single deployment in any canto of such
words: ^giusta~ and ^giustamente~ here; ^giustamente~ (42); ^giusta~
(50 and 51); ^giuste~ (84); ^giustizia~ (119).  The neighboring canto
(VI) is tied for second place with four, thus making these two cantos
the center of this concern in a poem that is perhaps more concerned
with justice than with any other single concept.  See the note to
^Inferno~ III.4.  And now see Patrick Boyde (^Human Vices and Human
Worth in Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
2000], Chapter Nine).

	|25-33.~  Adam's sin of transgression (and it is significant that Dante
here is placing on ^his~ shoulders the sin of Eve) was what "brought
sin into the world and all our woe" (Milton, ^Paradise Lost~ I.3), to
borrow the words of another major poet's reference to that
transgression.  It is this for which the Word of God chose, in his love
for humankind, to offer Himself as flesh in sacrificial atonement for
all sin since Adam.  (It was precisely this humanity of Jesus in which
Justinian did not at first believe [see ^Par~. VI.13-15].)

	|26.~  Adam was not born; he was created directly by God, as was
(almost) Eve.

	|28.~  Scartazzini/Vandelli (comm. on vv. 28-33) point to ^Monarchia~
III.iv.14 for the phrase ^infirmitas peccati~ (infirmity of sin) as
corresponding to the sickness afflicting the human race after Adam's
fall.

	|29.~  Later Dante will spell out the exact amount of time that passed
between Adam's sin and his redemption, 5232 years.  See ^Paradiso~
XXVI.118-123.

	|30.~  The "Word of God" is Jesus, as Second Person of the Trinity.

	|31-33.~  This tercet includes reference to the two other aspects of
the triune God, the Sapience represented by the Son having been
mentioned in verse 30 (where Beatrice refers to the Word becoming
flesh): the Power represented by the Father, "Maker" of all things; the
Love represented by the Holy Spirit.

	|34-45.~  Humankind, a combination of immortal soul and mortal body, as
present in Adam and Eve, quickly (for exactly how quickly, see ^Par~.
XXVI.139-142) turned from God to sin and was sent out of Eden.  If we
measure what was done to Christ upon the cross by the enormous burden
of sin He took on, His penalty was utterly just; if, on the other hand,
we measure the worth of the one who was punished, no greater outrage
was ever committed, especially when we consider what He had voluntarily
consented to.

	|39.~  The verse repeats, as Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 34-39)
was perhaps the first to realize, Christ's dictum (John 14:6) "Ego sum
via, et veritas, et vita" (I am the way, and the truth, and the life).
The text continues, "No one comes to the Father unless through me."

	|46-48.~  The paired results of Christ's sacrifice are expressed in a
chiasmus: The death of Jesus pleased (a) God and (b) the Jews; it
caused both (b) the earthquake at the Crucifixion and (a) the opening
of Heaven to humankind.  The Jews took perverse pleasure at the killing
of Jesus for which reason God made the earth shake, expressing His
displeasure; at the same time, and of far greater importance, God
accepted Jesus' sacrifice and opened Heaven to redeemed humanity.

	|49-51.~  Beatrice's repetition of the adjective ^giusta~ (just)
underlines her main concern for Dante, that he understand that God
never acts unjustly.  She has taken care of his first doubt, which
arose from what Justinian said about the reign of Titus.

	|52-120.~  Next Beatrice turns to the problem that arose for the
protagonist in Justinian's remarks about the reign of Tiberius.  This
is one of the most pernicious stumbling blocks for non-believers and
even some Christians.  It is the question posed (and answered) by
Beatrice here (see Scartazzini's lengthy gloss to this passage, which
deals with Dante's complex discussion clearly).  The two main sources
for Dante's thinking about the justification for the death of Jesus on
the cross are, according to Scartazzini, St. Thomas (^ST~ III, q. 46,
a. 1-3) and St. Anselm of Canterbury (^Cur Deus homo~).  For insistence
on the primacy, for Dante's  thinking on this subject, of Anselm's
tract, see Fallani ("Il Canto VII" in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp. 233-34).

	|52-63.~  Now, reading Dante's mind, Beatrice sees what is troubling
him; there must have been some other way for human sin to have been
canceled short of having the incarnate Godhead be slain upon a cross.
Beatrice warns that her proof will be difficult, because only those
nourished over time by the warmth of God's affection ever understand
this mystery, i.e, only those inspired by the Holy Spirit are able to
understand the love for humankind that impelled Jesus to give up his
life for us.

	|57.~  From Lombardi (1791, comm. to vv. 56-57) to Grabher (1934, comm.
to vv. 55-63) most commentators think the word ^pur~ here means "only."
 Starting with Trucchi (1936, comm. to vv. 52-57), the tide begins
swinging to ^proprio~ (precisely, exactly); Chimenz (1962, comm. to vv.
56-57) prefers this meaning to "only," as do Bosco/Reggio (1979, comm.
to vv. 56-57); as our translation indicates, we do, too.

	|64-120.~  Tozer's summary of these passages may be helpful: "Man,
inasmuch as his soul proceeded direct from God, possessed the gifts of
immortality, free will, and likeness to God, and on these depended his
high position (vv. 64-78).  By the Fall the freedom of his will and his
likeness to God were impaired, and his position was lost (vv. 79-81).
There were only two ways by which he could recover this, i.e., either
(1) that he should make satisfaction himself for his sin, or (2) that
God in His mercy should pardon him freely (vv. 82-93).  The former of
these it was impossible for man to do, because he could not render any
adequate recompense; it remained therefore for God to guarantee his
pardon (vv. 94-105).  This God did in a manner at once most consonant
with His own nature, as being perfect Goodness, and most advantageous
to man, and most in accordance with the demands of justice.  He
followed both the way of mercy and the way of justice.  By the
Incarnation and death of Christ He enabled man to regain his lost
position, and at the same time made the satisfaction for his sins which
justice required" (vv. 106-20).

	|64-65.~  For an attempt to demonstrate the closeness of the thought
here to that found in Plato's ^Timaeus~, see Fraccaroli ("Dante e il
^Timeo~," in ^Il Timeo~, tr. Giuseppe Fraccaroli [Turin: Fratelli
Bocca, 1906], pp. 393-97), disputing the more usual nineteenth-century
claim of a dependence upon Boethius.  However, see Richard Green's note
to the passage, in his translation of the ^Consolatio~ (Boethius, ^The
Consolation of Philosophy~, ed. O. Piest [New York: Bobbs-Merrill,
1962], p. 60), pointing out that the poem ("O qui perpetua mundum
ratione gubernas" [O you who govern the world with eternal reason]) in
Boethius (^Consolatio~ III.m9) is recognized as being an epitome of the
first section of the ^Timaeus~.  Among the early commentators, Pietro
di Dante (comm to vv. 64-78) cites Boethius ("Rather it was the form of
the highest good, existing within You without envy, which caused You to
fashion all things according to the external exemplar"), while
Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 64-66) and Francesco da Buti (comm. to
vv. 64-75) cite ^Timaeus~ 29e (the opening of Book I): "Optimus erat,
et ab optimo omnis invidia relegata est" (He [the god who made
universal disorder into order] was good: and in the good no jealousy in
any matter can ever arise [tr. F.M. Cornford - Plato is speaking of the
divine mind, as is Boethius).  For more support of Plato's candidacy
and general consideration of the problem, see Cesare Galimberti ("Canto
VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], pp. 227-35).  Sapegno (comm. to vv.
64-66) was perhaps the first to cite both (Boethius, ^Cons~.
III.m9.1-6; Plato, ^Tim~. I).  Giacalone (comm. to vv. 64-66) offers
helpful discussion and bibliography.

	|67.~  Those things created directly, i.e., without mediation, by God
include the angels, the heavenly spheres, unformed matter (e.g., the
earth's surface, awaiting the formal intervention of God to be given
its definitive shape), and the rational part of the tripartite human
soul.  For the distinction between this unformed God-created matter,
Augustine's ^materia informis~, and "prime matter" (^materia prima~),
see David O'Keeffe ("Dante's Theory of Creation," ^Revue
n$eoscolastique de philosophie~ 26 [1924], pp. 51-57).

	|68-69.~  That which God creates unmediated is eternal and unvarying.

	|72.~  The "more recent" things were created, not directly by God, but
with some mediation (e.g., planetary influence), since all of these
were part of a "secondary creation."

	|85-87.~  In Adam, we all sinned, and have been denied the privileges
that once were his, particularly three things: immortality, the earthly
paradise, and our resemblance to God.

	|97-100.~  We were not capable of abasing ourselves in humility deep
enough to make up for the amount we had risen up in pride.

	|103-111.~  Thus it remained for God to ransom us using either mercy or
justice.  He elected to employ both of these.

	|112-120.~  Dante employs ^hysteron proteron~ yet again to mark either
end of human history, the last night of life on earth (see the
Apocalypse) and the first day (see Genesis).  In the period of time
sectored in that arc no greater act ever was or shall be than Jesus'
act of self-humiliation to save humankind.

	|124-138.~  This passage and the rest of the canto deal with the
ontology of God's creation, specifically the distinctions between the
nature of being in that which is created directly by God (things
eternal or, more properly, since they have a beginning in time,
sempiternal) and in that which, though created by God (for nothing that
exists owes or can owe its existence to any other first cause), has
other participation in its making (i.e., they are made by the
intervention of other already existent things, as are almost all things
that we encounter: butterflies, the cliffs of Dover, rain).  On this
question see Moore's late essay, "Dante's Theory of Creation" (^Studies
in Dante~, Fourth Series: ^Textual Criticism of the "Convivio" and
Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 {1917}], pp. 134-65),
and the stern response by David O'Keeffe ("Dante's Theory of Creation,"
^Revue n$eoscolastique de philosophie~ 26 [1924]; Moevs' discussion
(^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2005], pp. 122-26), agrees with O'Keeffe's objections to Moore's
formulations, which underlie many later (mis-)understandings of the
basic cosmic views put forward here by Beatrice, and which, as a
result, are incorrect.  As Moevs points out (pp. 123-24), Beatrice
fears lest Dante, mistaking her words at vv. 67-69, fail to distinguish
between primary creation (i.e., directly by God) and secondary creation
(God acting in collaboration with other agents).  As Moevs rightly
insists, for Dante there is no such thing as creation independent of
God; but there is (1) direct creation and (2) indirect creation; in the
latter other agents besides the deity have a role.  All such entities,
Beatrice concludes, are "mortal," including the four elements.  This
passage is not made easier by its frequent use of the past participle
of the verb ^creare~.  The word ^creature~ at verse 127 has the sense
of "things created" (by God).  But this, mirroring the protagonist's
confusion, blurs the crucial distinction that Beatrice will make; all
things are created by God, some few directly (and they are eternal or,
to use the correct term, sempiternal) but most parts of the made
universe, as the four elements, indirectly.  At verse 131 ^creati~ also
refers to divine creation, but this time (and for the only time in this
passage) of direct creation by God, and hence of eternal things, both
angels and the heavenly spheres.  In verse 135 ^creata~ refers to the
secondary creation of the informative power in the stars, as it does in
both of its iterations in vv. 136 and 137.  The text could not be
clearer, but its use of the same term, ^creare~, for both kinds of
creation, primary and secondary (i.e., direct and indirect), makes a
reader's task more difficult.

	|124-129.~  This is the second consecutive canto in which Dante has not
spoken (he is in fact silent from ^Par~. V.129 until ^Par~. VIII.44
[for his considerably longer period of abstention from speech, see
^Par~. IX.81-^Par~. XIV.96].  In this canto his suppressed speech is
reported (but not uttered) at vv. 10-12 and Beatrice speaks his doubt
for him in vv. 55-57 and then once more here in this passage.

	|139-144.~  For a paraphrase of the first tercet, see Tozer (comm. to
vv. 139-141): "From speaking of things without life Beatrice passes to
those which possess the sensitive or the vegetative life without the
rational soul.  These also are not incorruptible, because their life is
produced mediately by the influence of the stars, acting on those
elements of their nature (i.e., of the matter of which they are
composed) which are capable of being affected by them.  'The brightness
and the motion of the holy lights (the stars) draws forth the life of
brutes and plants from the combination of elements ^(complession~) in
them, which is endued with power (^potenziata~) thereto,' i.e., to be
so affected.  ^Complession~ in its technical use means 'a combination
of elements,' e.g., of humours of the body, or properties of matter."
And see Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 2005], p. 125), on this passage: "The souls of all
plants and animals are 'drawn from' varying compounds of the sublunar
elements (^complession potenz,iata~) by the influence of the stars, but
human life (the human intelligence or rational soul) 'breathes
directly' from the 'supreme beneficence,' from Intellect-Being itself.
That is why the human mind or soul is always in love with, and never
ceases to seek union with, the ground of its being, of all being."

	|145-148.~  Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~
[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], pp. 130-132), points out an
error underpinning some commentators' responses to the Dantean
formulation of a central theological issue in this canto: the
corruptibility of the first bodies given to humankind directly by God.
Their usual position is that this body, created as home of the soul in
both Adam and Eve, was incorruptible; thus its "true nature" is
incorruptible, despite original sin; with resurrection we regain that
incorruptible body.  But what, we may ask, of the damned?  Clearly
their bodies are not of the incorruptible kind, since the damned
all-too-painfully recollect the corruptions of the body and live
repeating them eternally, as we have seen often enough in ^Inferno~.
That is a negative argument, if perhaps a useful one.  Moreover, and as
Moevs, following O'Keeffe ("Dante's Theory of Creation," ^Revue
n$eoscolastique de philosophie~ 26 [1924], pp. 61-62), points out, the
argument is heretical on its own terms.  No Christian authority ever
said that the human body was eternal, even in its original Edenic
condition (but exacty this opinion is found among some commentators;
see, e.g., Fallani ["Il Canto VII" in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro {Rome: Bonacci, 1989}, p. 236], holding that
it is indeed immortal).  And so the question arises: Will we be given
what we originally had, a corruptible body washed clean of its sins
(unlike the maculate body that is the property of anyone damned), as
our soul has been?  Or will we receive a truly incorruptible body?  In
one way of understanding, the body has always been, and always will be,
corruptible (even if, resurrected, it will not decay any more).  To
triumph in it is also to triumph over it.  Moevs concludes his
treatment of this problematic passage as follows (p. 132): "Beatrice
has re-expressed the great Clementine dictum that God became man so
that man may learn from man how to become God."  But see Paul's
discussion of the raising of the dead in I Corinthians 15:35-54, which
certainly seems to promise incorruptible flesh to those who participate
in the general resurrection.
