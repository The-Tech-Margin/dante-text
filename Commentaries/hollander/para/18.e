	|1-3.~  This is a more difficult tercet than it may seem.  The standard
view in the first commentators is that Cacciaguida was delighting in
what he had said to his great-great-grandson, while the protagonist was
sharing in that joy.  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 1) disentangles the
tortuous skein of debate over this line, pointing out that the text
suggests that each of the two participants contemplates different
"words."  He acknowledges Venturi and Lombardi, the first moderns to
anticipate his solution (a form of which is perhaps first found in
Francesco da Buti), and then proceeds to give what has become the
standard modern view: The word ^verbo~ must here be understood as a
translation of the Scholastic Latin term ^verbum~ (e.g., as defined by
Thomas Aquinas, ^ST~ I, q. 34, a. 1), meaning "concept of the inner
mind."  Thus, we at least may conjecture, Cacciaguida was enjoying his
understanding, beyond these contingent events, of a higher form of
being, in the light of Eternity, while Dante was seeing, ^sub specie
humanitatis~, the harmonious relation of his exile to his eventual
happiness.  This would mark an improvement in his cognition (seeing
eventual concord where he was expecting only grief), which,
nonetheless, remained limited by his mortal aspirations.  To mark the
differences in their levels of experience, as Torraca (comm. to this
tercet) observes, Dante uses very different verbs: Cacciaguida savors
^(godeva)~ completely his inner concept of deity, while the protagonist
has but a first taste ^(gustava)~ of his own higher awareness.

See Denise Heilbronn-Gaines ("^Paradiso~ XVIII," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995], p. 266) for the notion that Cacciaguida
was (as was also the protagonist) taking pleasure in his inward rapture
over Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity.  As she points out,
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 1-12) was the first to make this point,
but she does not go on to say that he offers the standard gloss first,
with this explanation as possible alternative, nor that he doesn't
carry that possible understanding over to include the protagonist's
joy, as she (perhaps incorrectly) does.  For a more recent review of
the problem, including reference to P$ezard's previous attempt to
locate this ^verbo~ in a theological semantic field, see Giacalone
(comm. to vv. 1-2).  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 1) cites Cesari, who
may in fact have been the first modern to suggest that ^verbo~ here
refers to the Word.

	|3.~  Few commentators point out the obvious (but see at least Carroll
[comm. to vv. 1-18]): The third verse reflects Cacciaguida's promise
(^Par~. XVII.43-45) of an eventual harmonious resolution of the
problems inherent in Dante's exile.  The protagonist is now capable of
a larger and wider view of the impending events in his life, knowing
that they are a part of the divine plan, one that includes his writing
this text and that corroborates the rightness of his political
decisions in the greater scheme of things.  Unlike Cacciaguida,
however, he is not yet capable of seeing essences without their
contingent trappings.

	|5-6.~  Beatrice, perhaps having tuned in on the inner thoughts of both
Cacciaguida and Dante, reminds her charge that God takes away any sense
of loss in earthly circumstances that the saved may feel, according to
Dante's current understanding.  Once saved, a soul is ^in patria~, not
in exile any longer.

Beatrice, who has been uncharacteristically silent in Mars (to make
room for the poet's "Cacciaguida voice," which is expansive), now
speaks for only the second time in this heaven.  She has smiled twice
(^Par~. XV.71 and XVI.14) and spoken once (^Par~. XVII.7-12); she will
speak once more (vv. 20-21), as briefly as she does now.

	|7-15.~  The insistent presence of first-person pronouns
and pronominal adjectives in this passage (^io~ is heard four times,
the rhyming ^mio~, three) is striking.	It reminds us that, from the
beginning, we have had to consider the strategic difference between
the writing agent and the behaving protagonist, the first seeing all
things in the light of his final vision of God, the second experiencing
them cumulatively.  In fact, this simple bipartite division has caused
a certain confusion.
 Most current discussants, some without referring to the critic
who first in the twentieth century deployed the word ^agens~ (lit.,
"agent," the one who acts), simply appropriate without credit Francesco
Mazzoni's questionable interpretation of the ^Epistle to Cangrande
~(^Epist~. XIII.38): "The author ^[agens]~, then, of the whole and of the
part is the person mentioned above, who is seen to be such throughout"
(tr. P. Toynbee).  Mazzoni wants ^agens~ to refer to Dante-protagonist,
not Dante-poet.  (See Mazzoni, "L'Epistola a Cangrande," ^Rendiconti della
Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei~ [Classe di Scienze morali, storiche e
filologiche] Ser. 8, 10 [1955]: 174-78.  Hollander [^Dante's Epistle to
Cangrande~ {Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993}, pp. 21-22]
for reasons to doubt that hypothesis.)

Recently Picone ("Leggere la ^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Inferno~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2000], pp. 18-21) has argued that there are visible
in the poem "three Dantes," the protagonist, the narrator, and the
author.  Giuseppe Ledda's remarks in response (^La guerra della lingua~
[Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp. 13-17) bring the problem sharply into
focus.  Taking his cue from G$erard Genette (^Figures III~ [Paris:
Seuil, 1972]), distinguishing among these three figures as they may be
found in Proust's vast novel (where the distinctions surely work better
than they do in the ^Commedia~), Ledda presents for examination
Picone's assertion that we must learn to distinguish not only between
Dante the protagonist in the action narrated and the Dante who narrates
that action (Dantes 1 and 2), but must distinguish also between that
second Dante and a third one, the "author."  One might simplify
Picone's case as follows: the narrator merely narrates, while the poet
adds the elements that make the work a poem and not a mere prose
narrative.  However, if we know that the poem was written over many
years (see P^ar~. XXV.3), do we ever sense inside the boundaries of the
poem any change of heart or mind within the speaking voice?  In other
words, are not the "narrator" and the "poet" (Dante number 2 and
putative number 3), within our experience as readers, one and the same?
 One simple key we can use to resolve this question is to ask whether,
within the text of the poem, the poet ever tells us something that the
narrator does not know.  That, it is probably fair to say, would be the
pre-condition to make any such argument as Picone's convincing.  Thus
the author of ^Paradiso~ never lets on that he indeed knows things that
the author of ^Inferno~ did not know; the protagonist develops,
changes, while the narrator does not.  At least that is the given of
the poem.  Someone named Dante (^Purg~. XXX.55), perhaps thirty-five
years old (^Inf~. I.1), took a journey to the afterworld in late March
or early April of the year 1300 (^Inf~. XXI.113), and was away almost
precisely one week (^Par~. XXVII.79-87).  Sometime after that, a poet,
the very same person, wrote the record of that journey in verse.  When
did he do that?  Sometime between 1300 and his death.  We can resort to
history if we have to, and most of us might agree to the following
extrapolation: between 1306 and 1321.  However, it is more accurate to
say that the poem was written over "many years," as the text (^Par~.
XXV.3) tells us, and all that we can say for certain is that these
years were sometime after 1300, before 1321, and of indeterminate
duration.  In the course of them nothing happened that changed the
narrative in any way -- or such is the poem's unexpressed but
nonetheless clear given.

And so, while we have suspicions so strong that they are equivalent to
knowledge that there are in fact "three Dantes," the poet himself has
excised one of these, making his narrator and that poetic self utterly
indivisible, with the result that, in theory, that is, within the
givens of the poem, there are but two Dantes.  Even that many Dantes
has caused enough difficulty over the centuries to make us want to try
to avoid adding still another.  The fact is that the "real" author
obviously knew a great many things that were at odds with what he knew
when he began writing the poem (e.g., the emergence into importance and
the death of both Pope Clement and of Henry VII).  We can sense that
this is so, but never because he tells us.  That he spends as much
effort as he does in maintaining the fiction of a single
narrator/author should be evidence enough for us.  On the other hand,
he surely knew that we would understand, extradiegetically, that is,
^outside~ the parameters of the fiction, that the narrator and the poet
are two, not one, that the narrator is himself a construct of the poet.
 This is not to surrender in any way to the force of the arguments of
those who would propose that we acknowledge "three Dantes," but to
recontextualize the question so that we can have, as readers of the
text, a clearer and more certain relationship to the writing voice that
we attend to.  As theoreticians of literature we are free to indulge
our appetites for such imaginative post-Proustian sprees as freely as
we like -- but only if we begin by acknowledging that the poet goes out
of his way to deny the validity of that sort of consideration of the
question.  In life there were three Dantes (and more if we want to
consider the other works of this changeful writer); in his poem there
are but two.

	|8-12.~  This passage reflects the earlier one at ^Paradiso~ I.5-9,
which similarly insists on the poet's incapacity to retell what he has
experienced and forgotten, since his memory was not up to containing so
momentous an experience.

	|8.~  The word ^conforto~, used as a noun to describe another human
being (e.g., "that person was my comfort"), has been employed three
times before now (^Inf~. IV.18; ^Purg~. III.22, IX.43), on each
occasion assigned to Virgil; here, for the first (and last) time
referring to anyone else, it obviously refers to Beatrice.  For the
possibility that Dante is here reacting to Cino's "Consolatoria" in
response to the death of Beatrice, see Hollander ("Dante and Cino da
Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992], p. 217): Cino's poem has Amor
calling out for ^conforto~ on Dante's behalf.  Perhaps his text is
responsible for Dante's referring to Beatrice here as he does.

	|11.~  Bruno Nardi ("Perch$e 'dietro la memoria non pu@o ire'
[^Paradiso~, I, 9]," in his ^"Lecturae" e altri studi danteschi~, ed.
Rudy Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1990 {1960}], pp. 267-68) argues
that ^mente~ here means "intellect" and not "memory," an interpretation
crucial to his reinterpretation of ^Par~. I.9 (see the note to that
passage), but not easily acceded to.

	|16-18.~  Beatrice's beauty is now understood to mirror the greatest
beauty of all, that of God.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXXI.47-54
for a discussion of the verbal noun ^piacere~, denoting the aesthetic
aspect of divinity.  For Aquinas on God's aesthetic dimension, see ^ST~
I, q. 39, a. 8, where he argues that "the highest form and paradigm of
beauty is the splendor of God as manifested through Christ, to whom...
the name 'Beauty' is most fittingly attributed" (Franco Masciandaro
["^Paradiso~ XXIII," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings
III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics {^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~,
16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995}], p.
329).

See Took (^L'etterno piacer~: Aesthetic Ideas in Dante~ [Oxford:
Clarendon, 1984], pp. 10-22) on this tercet (and ^Par~. XXVII.91-96) in
relation to the problem of Dante's "idealist" (Platonic) or
"immanentist" (Aristotelian) sense of beauty, that is, whether God is
the only and direct source of any beauty or whether things in the world
have their own independent beauty.  While in these passages Took
rightly argues that Dante is in the first camp (that of the
Pseudo-Dionysius, among Dante's probable authorities), in many another,
as Took demonstrates, he is in the second (that of Thomas Aquinas).  In
this respect also (one thinks of such binomes as papacy and empire,
Latin and vernacular, of which Dante embraces both terms, refusing to
settle for an either/or formulation) Dante often has things both ways.

	|19-21.~  Beatrice "conquers" Dante's will by compelling him to look
away from her eyes in order to turn his attention a final time to the
words of his great-great-grandfather.  This is the last smile she will
direct at Dante for quite some time.  See the note to ^Paradiso~
XXIII.46-48.

	|22-27.~  This simile compares a particularly affection-bearing glance,
perceived on earth, to the visibly increased flame of Cacciaguida's
desire to speak again to his descendant.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 13-15) call our attention to Dante's
equation of the soul and its affections in ^Convivio~ (III.iii.14).

	|28-36.~  Apparently having finished his performance, Cacciaguida, like
Solomon (^Par~. XIV.37-60), returns for an encore.  And, like
Solomon's, his has ramifications for our understanding of the genre of
his poem.  Solomon's was a hymn to the Resurrection; his is a piece
from a Christian martial epic.  For this last as a Dantean genre, see
Hollander ("Dante and the Martial Epic," ^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989]:
62-91), arguing that, after an initial series of rebuffs to martial
epic in ^Inferno~, eventually in ^Paradiso~ the poet begins to
associate himself, through Cacciaguida, with a Christian poetry of
crusade, surely a martial subject.

	|29.~  The image of the tree that is nourished from its topmost tip,
that is, the "tree" of the saved in the Empyrean by God Himself, may
reflect, as Battaglia Ricci suggests ("Con parole e segni. Lettura del
XVIII del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995], p. 11), biblical
language in general or perhaps Matthew 13:22 and/or Ezechiel 47:12.

	|31-33.~  See the note to ^Paradiso~ IX.38-42 for the sort of fame that
is praiseworthy, even in a Christian context.

	|33.~  For the word ^musa~ as meaning "poet" (or, as seems more likely,
"poem," according to Bosco/Reggio [comm. to this verse]), see the note
to ^Paradiso~ XV.26.  For the meaning "poem," Bosco/Reggio cite Virgil,
^Eclogues~ III.84 and VIII.5; Horace, ^Epistle~s I.xix.28; ^Satires~
II.vi.17.

	|34-36.~  Cacciaguida promises that, as he names each of these heroic
figures, it will traverse the "arms" of the cross, looking like
lightning flashing in a cloud (cf. the first description of these
lights as flames glowing behind alabaster, ^Par~. XV.22-24).

	|36.~  This verse is the last spoken by Cacciaguida.  See the note to
^Paradiso~ XIV.52-57 for the similarly talkative Thomas Aquinas.  Of
the 628 verses in the heaven of the Sun, 287 are spoken by him (46%);
of the 553 in Mars, 297 are spoken by Cacciaguida (54%).

	|37-51.~  For Dante's knowledge of the French tradition of the ^Neuf
preus~ (Nine Worthies), see Hollander ("Dante and the Martial Epic,"
^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989]: 83-85), citing Joan Ferrante (^The Political
Vision of the "Divine Comedy"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1984], p. 277n.), and pointing to the first frontal study of Dante's
eclectic treatment of this traditional subject, a then-forthcoming
article by Lauren Scancarelli Seem.  See also the discussion in Picone
("Canto XVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 268-71).
 Picone rightly notes that Seem's article (accepted by ^Forum Italicum~
around 1989) never appeared.  See also Battaglia Ricci ("Con parole e
segni. Lettura del XVIII del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995], pp.
13-14).  Trucchi (comm. to vv. 34-36) observes only that the exemplary
fighters are nine, "a symbolic and perfect number," but is unaware, as
is the entire commentary tradition, of the likely presence of a
reference to the Nine Worthies.  Seem, in her unpublished article,
argues that Dante knew the tradition of these nine heroes, three
Jewish, three pagan, three Christian, from either ^Les Voeux du paon~,
by Jacques de Longuyon (ca. 1298-1309), or from the earlier Latin and
French tradition, dating from the eleventh century (with somewhat
differing lists of heroes), that Jacques himself relied on.

The traditional list of the ^Nove prodi~ includes five not included in
Dante's revised list (the right-hand column in the two lists below):

\<pre\>
Joshua				[1 in Dante also]
David				Roland [4]
Judas Maccabeus			[2 in Dante]
Hector				William of Orange [5]
Alexander the Great		Renouard [6]
Julius Caesar			Robert Guiscard [8]
King Arthur			Cacciaguida [9]
Charlemagne			[3 in Dante]
Godfrey of Bouillon		[7 in Dante]
\</pre\>

It seems clear that Dante is taking a canonical list and recasting it
to conform to his special purposes.  He includes two of the first three
and the last pair of names (Joshua, Judas Maccabeus; Charlemagne,
Godfrey), dropping the middle four, and then adding five more recent
"Christian heroes," three drawn from fictional treatments, sometimes of
historical characters (Roland and William of Orange, if not Renouard)
and two from history itself (Robert Guiscard, Cacciaguida), and
"updating" the list, which had ended with Duke Godfrey, leader of the
first Crusade (1096), by adding last his own ancestor, who had
perished, a martyr, in the second (1147).  The lists themselves reveal
something of their differing purposes.  The "Neuf preus" include six
"ancients" (three Hebrews, two Greeks, one Roman), and three "moderns"
(one Briton and two Frenchmen); Dante's version of them skips David and
the "ancient gentiles" and leaps from its two Hebrews to Charlemagne,
who, as is each one of the rest, is Christian.  All six who were active
between 800 and 1100 are "French," but the ninth and most recent among
Dante's worthies is ^italianissimo~.  One might speculate that David is
omitted from Dante's list because the poet preserves him to be his Old
Testament ^alter ego~, a lover and a singer and a just king rather than
a fighter (he will appear soon enough, in his own right, in the eye of
the Eagle, ^Par~. XX.38); the three pagans do not require any more
reason to be excused than their failure to be Christians; King Arthur
may be the most surprising omission, until one considers (as Seem does)
his guilt by association with the series of destructive love affairs at
his court.

	|38.~  Joshua, successor of Moses as leader of the Israelites, was, in
Dante's Christian eyes, the "first crusader" in that he conquered the
Holy Land, restoring it to its rightful populace.

	|39.~  This line makes it clear that the protagonist hears the names of
the heroes spoken by his ancestor, who thus becomes, for a moment, the
"author" of this part of the poem, and thus of a crusading epic.  See
the note to verse 51.  However, and as Giovanni Iorio ("Il Canto
XVIII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro
[Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 474) reminds us, there is not a word about
their battles; this text presents them as they are, now and forever, in
the sight of God, literally ^sub specie aeternitatis~, with all that
violence behind them.

	|40.~  Judas Maccabeus fought successfully against two kings of Syria,
both of whom wanted to extirpate the Jewish religion.  He eventually
was killed by a third in 160 B.C., but his mission had been
accomplished by then.

	|42.~  "It was joy that whipped that spinning top": That is, joy "was
the impulse which caused the rotation.  The homely simile is borrowed
from Virgil, ^Aeneid~ VII.378-384, where it is applied to Amata's wild
excitement when under the influence of the Fury" (Tozer, comm. to vv.
40-42).
In the days before mechanized toys, children used to keep their top
spinning (once they had imparted energy to it by rapidly pulling a cord
wrapped around it) by following it and "whipping" its sides with a
long, thin stick, thus maintaining its rotating motion.

	|43.~  Charlemagne (742-814) fought against the Saracens in Spain.  He
is the only emperor in the group.  Roland, while a historical figure
(counted among the Christian dead at the battle of Roncesvalles), is
better known from the ^Chanson de Roland~ and other medieval epic poems.

	|46.~  William, Duke of Orange (ca. 750-812), adviser of Charlemagne
and leader in several military successes of the Christian forces, but
still better known from the cycle of poems celebrating his valor.
Renouard, while not a historical figure, was perhaps believed by Dante
to be one.  As Charlemagne and Roland were paired in one cycle of
French ^chansons de geste~, so were William and Renouard in another.

	|47.~  Godfrey of Bouillon (1058-1100) led the first Crusade, resulting
in the conquest of Jerusalem.

	|48.~  Robert Guiscard ("Robert the Astute"), a historical figure
(1015-1085), was also celebrated in a Latin poem, ^Gesta Roberti
Wiscardi~.  Exactly why Dante wanted him included in his list is not
clear, indeed is the subject of a certain scholarly puzzlement.
Further, he violates the chronology established by the inclusion of
Godfrey before him.  Dante has previously mentioned him (^Inf~.
XXVIII.13-14) as having defeated the Saracens in Puglia, and that may
have been his single largest qualification in the poet's eyes.

	|49.~  Cacciaguida has rejoined the temporary residents of the cross
and now he also streaks along its radial beam.

	|51.~  The word ^artista~, as Hollander ("Dante and Cino da Pistoia,"
^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992], pp. 217-18) has argued, is perhaps used
here for the first time in Italian with its modern sense, that is, not
only as the practitioner of one of the liberal arts (in this case,
music), but as a full-fledged "artist," both composer and performer of
his own work, performing his "mini-epic" of nine crusading spirits, his
personal version of the Nine Worthies.  Its second such use will be in
^Paradiso~ XXX.33, where Dante will join his great-great-grandfather as
one of the only two "artists" so designated in the ^Commedia~.  See
also Hollander (^ibid~.), p. 218, for the suggestion that Dante's sense
of the word reflects its appearance in the sonnet of Cino da Pistoia
attacking Guido Cavalcanti, "Qua' son le cose vostre ch'io vi tolgo."

The musical reference of this canto, its concerns so often expressed in
musical terms, is studied by Denise Heilbronn-Gaines ("^Paradiso~
XVIII," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17,
supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 266-76).

	|52-69.~  The ascent from Mars to Jupiter is accomplished during the
course of a single action (Dante looks into Beatrice's eyes [vv.
52-57]), which is amplified by two similes (vv. 58-63, 64-69).  The
first combines awareness of the slowness of process with the suddenness
of the realization that a change has finally occurred; the second
presents a subtle change (the return of normal complexion) that follows
a fairly dramatic event (a blush of modesty in response to some sort of
embarrassment) that recedes perceptibly over a brief period.  See the
note to vv. 64-66.  The first simile refers to the ascent from Mars and
arrival in Jupiter in spatial terms, while the second reflects the
colors of the two planets, respectively red and silvery white.  Each
refers to a subtle process, occurring over an indeterminate period of
time, that is suddenly perceived as having involved fairly dramatic
change.

	|56-57.~  As we may have suspected, Beatrice, in this her latest
presence to Dante as they both ascend to a new realm, is even more
beautiful than ever.  See verses 7-21, the last time he looked upon his
lady in the heaven of Mars.

	|58-60.~  Mattalia (comm. to this tercet) points out that this tercet
reflects, along with other passages in the minor works and the ^Comedy~
(e.g., ^Purg~. IV.85-95), a basic Aristotelian ^dictum~: that any
virtuous operation of the soul resulting in joy to the practitioner
requires constant practice.  Grandgent (comm. to this tercet) cites
Aristotle's ^Ethics~ (II.iii.1).

	|61-62.~  Dante has become aware that the segment of the ideal circle
traversed by his body in each sphere is increasing in circumference the
higher he rises, a natural result of his progress up through the
heavens.

	|63.~  Beatrice began her "career" as ^miracolo~ in Dante's life in
^Vita nuova~: XXI.4, XXV.6, and XXIX.3.

	|64-66.~  Beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to verse 64) and Poletto
(comm. to vv. 64-69), some readers have turned to Ovid for a source for
this blush in Arachne's face (^Metam~. VI.45-49).  The scene is a
troubling one: Athena appears (first disguised as an old woman) to
accept Arachne's challenge to a contest in weaving.  When the goddess
reveals herself, the other mortals present show reverence, except for
Arachne, whose involuntary blush is only momentary, and quickly fades,
like the red sky at dawn.  For a similar blush on the part of Beatrice,
see ^Par~. XXVII.31-34.  Picone ("Canto XVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 272) points out that the figuring element
and the thing figured are reversed in Dante's use of the passage,
reflecting an even more significant reversal, from a negative
experience (Arachne's transformation into a spider) to a positive one
(the letter M's transmutation into a lily and then an eagle).

For some resonances of this Ovidian moment, see, among others,
Teodolonda Barolini ("Arachne, Argus, and St. John: Transgressive Art
in Dante and Ovid," ^Mediaevalia~ 13 [1987]: 207-26) and Pamela Royston
Macfie ("Ovid, Arachne and the Poetics of ^Paradiso~," in Rachel Jacoff
and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid
in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991], pp.
159-72).

	|68.~  Picone argues that this line marks the exact numerical midpoint
of the canto (verse 68 of 136), as is underlined by the enjambed word
^sesta~ (sixth) at verse 69, marking the arrival in the next (the
sixth) heaven, that of Jupiter.

For Jupiter as "temperate" planet, between two that are not, hot Mars
and cold Saturn, see ^Convivio~ II.xiii.25.

	|70.~  As Poletto (comm. to vv. 70-72) points out, the word ^facella~
(from Latin ^fax~, "torch") has been used once before to mean "star";
see ^Purgatorio~ VIII.89.

	|72.~  The phrase ^nostra favella~ has caused minor difficulty among
those who (rightly) understand the noun usually to refer to vernacular
speech and who therefore wonder why Dante uses this term for words that
are Latin, and not Italian.  The rhyme position obviously forced
Dante's hand a little here.  Most readers understand, along with
Steiner (comm. to this verse) and, even more pointedly, Momigliano
(comm. to vv. 70-72), that we should take the phrase more broadly and
as referring to human speech in general.

	|73-78.~  Poletto (comm. to these verses) seems to have been the first
to link them to ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.64-69.  And Benvenuto (comm. to vv.
73-78) the first to see that this image is derived from Lucan (^Phars~.
V.711-716).

Picone ("Canto XVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p.
274) points out that, while the avian "skywriting" observed by Lucan is
aleatory and quickly obliterated, Dante's is lasting, by virtue of its
inscription here in his pages.

	|73.~  Carroll (comm. to vv. 70-81) succinctly ties together the avian
imagery that, beginning here, is so present in Jupiter: "It is to be
noted that in this Heaven of the Eagle nearly all the similes are taken
from bird-life (e.g., in addition to the Eagle and the present passage:
XVIII.111, the mysterious reference to ^nests~; XIX.34, the ^falcon~
issuing from its hood; XIX.91, the comparison of the Eagle to the
^stork~ hovering over its young; XX.73, the ^lark~ pausing, content
with 'the last sweetness' of its song.  See the chap. on 'The Birds of
Dante' in Christopher Hare's ^Dante the Wayfarer~)."

	|74.~  Cf. the doves, also at their ^pastura~ (feeding), in an earlier
simile: ^Purgatorio~ II.124-125, as Torraca (comm. to vv. 73-75)
suggests.  These birds seem of better purpose.  While those earlier
"doves," temporarily seduced by an ode from Dante's ^Convivio~, failed
to distinguish between wheat and tares (see the note to ^Purg~.
II.124-132), these "cranes" are singing God's song to Dante. For a more
recent notice of the probable reference, see Hollander (^Dante and
Paul's "five words with understanding~," Occasional Papers, No. 1,
Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Texts and Studies
[Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992], p.
42), if without notice of any precursor.

	|76.~  These "holy creatures" ^(sante creature)~ will later (^Par~.
XIX.100-101) be identified as "lucenti incendi / de lo Spirito Santo"
(the Holy Spirit's fiery lights).

	|78.~  A curiosity that may also represent a coincidence: the letters
D, I, and L represent, in Roman numerals, the numbers 500, 1, and 50,
or 551, possibly for Dante a scrambled version of his "515" (^Purg~.
XXXIII.43), given that these numbers, too, are connected to questions
of rulership.  One hastens to say that, without confirming evidence,
this remains the merest speculation.

	|82-87.~  This is the sixth invocation of the poem and second in
^Paradiso~.  In the first ^cantica~ the second invocation (^Inf~.
XXXII.10-12) occurred thirty cantos after the first (^Inf~. II.7); in
the second, the intervening interval was a bit shorter (^Purg~. I.7-12
to ^Purg~. XXIX.37-42).  This is the shortest interval yet (^Par~.
I.13-21 to ^Par~. XVIII.82-87).  However, first-time readers may not
yet know that there are still three to come (^Par~. XXII.112-123,
^Par~. XXX.97-99, ^Par~. XXXIII.67-75).  What the Muse is asked to
perform, the inspiration of Dante so that he may give long life to
cities and kingdoms, might seem to require that Clio, the Muse of
history, is called upon here.  However, only one commentator even
mentions her as a possibility (Momigliano [comm. to verse 82]), and he
says only that the imperial context most fits Calliope or Clio.

The words ^ingegno~ (^Inf~. II.7; here; ^Par~. XXII.114) and ^concetto~
(^Inf~. XXXII.4; here; ^Par~. XXXIII.68) are both twice elsewhere
present in passages containing invocations.

	|82.~  The winged horse Pegasus struck the ground on Mt. Helicon with
his hoof.  There sprang forth Hippocrene, the fountain sacred to the
Muses.  Which one of them does the poet invoke here?  The most popular
choices (given in historical order) are (1) Minerva, "Wisdom," as a
sort of "super muse" (first suggested by Jacopo della Lana [comm. to
vv. 82-87]); (2) a nonspecific, "generic" muse (first, Benvenuto [comm.
to vv. 82-87]); (3) invoked for the second time in the poem (see
^Purg~. I.9), Calliope, the Muse of epic (first, Vellutello [comm. to
vv. 82-84], and the "majority candidate"); (4) also invoked for the
second time (see ^Purg~. XXIX.41), Urania, the heavenly Muse (first,
Andreoli [comm. to this verse]).  This is a vexed question, with four
fairly popular solutions (and a few others, e.g., Euterpe [Torraca,
comm. to vv. 82-84] and Clio [Momigliano, comm. to this verse]) and no
clear consensus.  All one can say is that the poet really seems to have
a particular Muse in mind, since he addresses her with the singular
"tu" in verse 87.

In apparent support of Minerva is the passage in Ovid (^Metam~.
V.250-272) in which she is portrayed as visiting Mt. Helicon, where she
is welcomed by the nine Muses.  Then, unidentified, one of the Muses
(almost certainly not Urania, the preceding speaker) addresses her,
saying that, had she not been charged with greater tasks (V.269), she
might have been free to join them.  This probably ought to rule Minerva
out (and Urania, as well), but we cannot be certain that Dante was
thinking of those details when he wrote this passage.

	|85.~  On the verb ^rilevare~, see the interesting discussion in
Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002]),  p.
82 and n.

	|88-96.~  Perhaps the single most self-conscious, "artificial" passage
in a poem that hardly lacks aesthetic exertion, the sort of thing
Romantic readers, in the wake of De Sanctis and Croce, despise in the
^Commedia~.  However, for the view that this sort of calculated
performance is a sign of the poet's "bello stile," see E.G. Parodi
("Gli esempi di superbia punita e il 'bello stile' di Dante," in his
^Poesia e storia della "Divina Commedia,"~ ed. G. Folena and P.V.
Mengaldo [Venice: Neri Pozza, 1965 {1915}], 149-61).

	|88-89.~  For the poet to have counted his letters (there are thirteen
different ones in all), thirty-five instances of vowels (18, with "i"
dominant [occurring 10 times]) and consonants (17, with "t" dominant
[occurring 5 times]), tells us that he was making a point that he
considered central to his purpose.

	|91-93.~  These five words ("Love justice, you who judge the earth")
constitute the opening sentence of the book
of the Bible called "Sapientia" (Wisdom), attributed, by Dante at
least, to Solomon.  That attribution was a matter of some dispute for
Christians, from the early Fathers on (e.g., in a fairly rare moment of
concord, both Jerome and Augustine deny Solomon paternity [if both err
in attributing it to Philo Judaeus]).  For discussions of Dante's
knowledge of this text, see G.R. Sarolli, "Salomone" (^ED~ IV [1973])
and the unsigned article (apparently by Alessandro Niccoli),
"Sapientia, Libro della" (^ED~ V [1976]).  Sarolli shows that Dante, in
one of his many references to the biblical king (^Conv.~ IV.xvi.1),
refers, by citing Wisdom 6:23, to Solomon as the author of that
now-apocryphal book.  This passage in ^Paradiso~ is treated by most
(including Sarolli) as the only reference to Wisdom in the ^Commedia~
(but see the note to verse 101), if there are two references in the
^Epistle to Cangrande~ (^Epist~. XIII.6 and XIII.62).  A question
arises regarding the differing sorts of wisdom that Dante has in mind
in ^Convivio~ (where, as Niccoli says, Solomon's "Wisdom" is treated as
the disembodied Sapience associated with the Lady Philosophy) and here
(where it is associated with God's purpose in creating human community,
in particular that of an imperial bent, on the model of Solomon's
kingship [see the notes to ^Par~. X.109-114, ^Par~. XIII.97-102, and
^Par~. XIII.140-142, ^inter alias~]).  Is this another example of
Dante's distancing himself in the ^Commedia~ from an earlier and quite
different view?  For a dispute between friends about the palinodic
nature of some of Dante's later references to ^Convivio~,
see Hollander ("Dante's Deployment of ^Convivio~
in the ^Comedy~," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~
[October 1996]) and Pertile ("Lettera aperta di Lino Pertile a Robert
Hollander sui rapporti tra ^Commedia~ e ^Convivio~," ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [October 1996]).  The
former's case may have received a measure of aid from Luca Azzetta ("La
tradizione del ^Convivio~ negli antichi commenti alla ^Commedia~:
Andrea Lancia, l'^Ottimo Commento~, e Pietro Alighieri," ^Rivista di
Studi Danteschi~ 5 [2005]: 3-7), who demonstrates that the text of
^Convivio~ was known ^in extenso~ by Andrea Lancia (in addition to
being known, perhaps less well, to the author of the ^Ottimo Commento~,
to Pietro di Dante, and to Giovanni Villani) no later than 1343.

For the program of St. Paul's "five words with understanding" in the
poem and its possible relevance here, see Hollander (^Dante and Paul's
"five words with understanding~," Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for
Medieval and Early Renaissance Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY:
Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992], pp. 39-43).

It seems probable that this is the third passage in the poem to involve
a phenomenon that might be described as "visible speech," formally
similar expressions that also prominently involve the idea of justice.
This one joins the "visible speech" found in the writing over the gate
of Hell (^Inf~. III.1-9) and the words "seen" in the intaglio
presenting Trajan and the widow (^Purg~. X.73-96).  See Hollander
(^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1969], pp. 297-300); Gino Casagrande ("'Esto visibile parlare':
A Synaesthetic Approach to ^Purgatorio~ 10.55-63," ^Lectura Dantis
Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II [Evanston:
Northwestern University Press, 1990], pp. 21-57), a meditation on the
mimetic overload found in ^Purgatorio~ X.55-63; Kenneth Knoespel ("When
the Sky Was Paper: Dante's Cranes and Reading as Migration," ^Lectura
Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II
[Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1990], pp. 121-46), an
independent but not dissimilar consideration of issues encountered in
this passage; Pertile ("^Paradiso~ XVIII tra autobiografia e scrittura
sacra," ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991]): 38, seeing the common elements in
the three passages much as did Hollander; and Bortolo Martinelli
("Canto XIX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 283).

	|91.~  It is not surprising that justice, most blatantly evident as a
guiding concern for this poet in this canto (where it is literally
spelled out in capital letters), has caught the attention of nearly all
who deal with it.  Raffaele Giglio's ^lectura~ ("Canto XVIII," in
^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples:
Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], pp. 345-62) is little more than a meditation on
Dante's conception of justice.  And see Siro Chimenz ("Il canto XIX del
^Paradiso~," in ^Letture dantesche. III. "Paradiso,"~ ed. G. Getto
[Florence: Sansoni, 1965 {1956}], p. 1735), supporting a definition of
the ^Commedia~ as a "poem of justice, both human and divine."  In this
vein, see also Scott (^Dante's Political Purgatory~ [Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996], p. 55), citing Dante's epistle
(^Epist~. XII.7), where he refers to himself as a "preacher of justice"
^(vir predicans iustitiam)~.  For consideration of Dante's sonnet "Se
vedi gli occhi miei" as underlining his continuing concern for justice
and as perhaps influencing Ambrogio Lorenzetti's allegory of Injustice
(in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena), see Claudio Giunta ("Il sonetto
dantesco 'Se vedi gli occhi miei' e le allegorie del malgoverno di
Ambrogio Lorenzetti," in his ^Saggi sulla poesia del Medioevo~
[Bologna: il Mulino, 2005], pp. 25-43).

For a consideration of the centrality of justice to Cantos XVIII-XX and
to the poem as a whole, see John Took ("'Diligite iustitiam qui
iudicatis terram': Justice and the Just Ruler in Dante," in ^Dante and
Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse [Oxford: Clarendon, 1997], pp. 137-51).
 Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 70-99) refers to two earlier passages that
reveal Dante's overwhelming respect for this ideal: "Thus, although
every virtue in man is deserving of love, that is most deserving of
love in him which is most human, and that is justice" (^Conv~. I.xii.9
-- tr. R. Lansing); "... Justice, which disposes us to love and conduct
ourselves with rectitude in all things" (^Conv~. IV.xvii.6 - tr. R.
Lansing).

	|94.~  Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 94-108) says that the "m," last
letter of the word ^terram~, stands for ^mondo~ (the world), a reading
immediately supported by the meaning of the word itself in Wisdom 1:1.
He continues by reading the souls making up the letter as being minor
public officials and private citizens who have in common a love of
justice; they will be the body politic for the emperor, figured in the
eagle's head into which the central stem of the letter will eventually
be transformed at its top.  It has become far more common, but only in
the twentieth century, for interpreters to claim that the letter stands
for ^monarchia~.  On the other hand, the early interpretation has the
virtue of separating the human desire for justice from its expression
in actual imperial rule, which would certainly correspond with Dante's
own experience, most of which was of a world that hoped for empire but
was denied its presence.  (See the note to vv. 100-108.)

Giovanni Iorio ("Il Canto XVIII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp. 479-80) expresses
perhaps justified exasperation with the theses of Joseph Chierici
(^L'aquila d'oro nel cielo di Giove: Canti XVII-XX del "Paradiso"~
[Rome: Istituto Grafico Tiberino, 1962]) -- which perhaps had attracted
more attention and support than Iorio would have wished -- that made
"Maria" the word the first letter of which is "spelled" by the ^emme~
and the eagle the emblem of Christ.  Iorio's distraction is
understandable in light of the obvious imperial reference of the entire
passage.

	|95-96.~  The planet itself is seen as a silver globe inlaid with
ornamentation worked in gold, the mobile souls carrying out God's
artisanship for Dante's pleasure and instruction.

	|97-99.~  Other souls, descending (from where we are not told, but it
is difficult to imagine from anywhere else but the Empyrean), not those
who had paused in their "skywriting," appear to make a "cap" on the
midpoint of the top of the "m," which then resembles (as we learn in
verse 113) a lily, as well as a capital "M" in Gothic script.

	|99.~  For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

	|100-108.~  The simile accounts for the rising of the souls (probably
from the second group alone [i.e., that which had just formed the cap]
and not from both groups, as some would understand) to represent the
head and neck of an eagle.  That physical detail remains a matter in
question (i.e., whether the souls forming the eagle derived only from
the new group or from both).  Also a cause for debate is the more
important question of what the three embodiments of the "m" represent.
There are many solutions proposed.  The more plausible explanations
limit the possible choices to the following: (1) whether the "m" stands
for ^monarchia~ or ^mondo~, (2) whether the "M" (as lily) stands for
France or Florence (its two most widely known identities), (3) whether
the "M" (as eagle) stands for Christ or the empire.  While arguments
can and have been made for all these interpretations (and more), and in
varying combinations, it does seem plausible to hold that the first
image indicates the "world" of would-be imperial citizens, while the
third indicates the empire once it is established (e.g., as Dante knew
it briefly under Henry VII, 1310-1313, and hoped to know it again).  As
for the second stage in the transformation (the most difficult to
interpret -- if no element of this puzzle is easily resolved), those
who argue that it indicates the ideal primitive Florence (i.e., as
Cacciaguida has described it in ^Par~. XVI), a template for the civic
virtues necessary to develop a populace capable of being led to empire,
are most in accord with what we know of Dante's predilections in these
matters.  On the other hand, to argue that the first "m" stands for
monarchy and the third for empire seems a doomed solution, since in
Dante's thought and language the two were synonymous; also, to argue
that Dante wanted the lily to represent either France or the current
Guelph party is not easily convincing, given what we know about his
negative feelings about both these entities.  See discussion in Lucia
Battaglia Ricci ("Con parole e segni. Lettura del XVIII del
^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 6 [1995], pp. 20-26).

For an interesting and idiosyncratic reading of the transformations of
the "m," see G.R. Sarolli (^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~
[Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp. 291-98).

	|100.~  For the connection of this image, "corrective" of divination,
with Dante's harsh views of that practice put forward in ^Inferno~ XX,
see Hollander ("The Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies
in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], pp. 197-99).

	|101.~  Pertile ("^Paradiso~ XVIII tra autobiografia e scrittura
sacra," ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991]: 41) cites Wisdom 3:7: "Fulgebunt
iusti, / Et tamquam scintillae in harundineto discurrent" (The just
will shine forth, / And they will show themselves like sparks in the
stubble), crediting Pietrobono (comm. to this verse) as being the only
other reader to note this clear citation (but also see Fallani [comm.
to vv. 100-102]).

	|105.~  This Sun is God and these arriving souls sing, apparently, of
their desire to return to Him.  It is of some interest that, forming
the head of the Eagle, they are in fact moving up, and thus back toward
Him.

	|109-111.~  Just as birds need no exemplar to design their nests, but
follow some inner imprinting, so God needs no "model" for his creating.
 This simple paraphrase of the tercet would have come as a great
surprise to almost all who either avoided dealing with it or who
labored over it in order to find something "more profound" in it.
Indeed, its first clear statement had to await Brunone Bianchi (comm.
to this tercet) in 1868.  However, it is perhaps prudent to observe
that the main opposing argument (there are several to choose from) has
it that not the nests but the creatures within them, referred to by
synecdoche, are portrayed as developing in accord with their archetypal
form.  And this just may be what Dante had in mind.  For more, see
Andreoli's objection (comm. to this tercet) to previous glosses and his
version of the formulation that begins this note.  Scartazzini's
lengthy comment (to verse 111) summarizes earlier efforts; he is surely
on the path toward seeing not "nests" but "nestlings" (as Francesco da
Buti [comm. to vv. 109-123] was the first to suggest) as the subject of
Dante's consideration.  See Tozer (comm. to this tercet) for a
paraphrase in English that is much as ours would be.

It was Grandgent (comm. to this tercet) who was perhaps the first to
point to Thomas Aquinas for a potential source (^ST~ I, q. 19, a. 4).
Perhaps still closer is the reference put forward by Christopher Becker
("Dante's Heretics," unpublished typescript read in 1988) to Thomas's
^Quaestiones disputatae de veritate~, XXIV, a. 1, resp. 3, which has it
that "all swallows build their nests in the same way."

	|112-114.~  The rest of the spirits who had at first seemed to be
content to make up the "enlilying" cap of the "M," now fill out the
Eagle's shape (his wings?).  This detail would argue against those who
claim that some of the first group are drawn up into this further
design.  It would seem rather that they stay in the original "m."  See
the note to vv. 100-108.

	|113.~  For a consideration of a range of possible significances of
this figure, see G.R. Sarolli (^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~
[Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp. 337-56).  Picone ("Canto XVIII," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 277-78) argues
effectively for the fugitive vision that Dante has of the "M" as lily
being the representation of the civic principles of Florence of the
"buon tempo antico" as being consistent with the restoration of Roman
imperial virtue in the city.  He goes on to associate one of Dante's
sonnets (^Rime~ CV) with this passage, arguing that the papacy's
repression of justice in the city stands in the way, not only of
Dante's return from exile, but of the empire's coming into its natural
ascendancy.  Edoardo Fumagalli ("^Par~. XVIII, 88-114, l'enigma del
giglio e la sapienza di re Salomone," ^L'Alighieri~ 26 [2005]: 111-25)
attempts to resuscitate the "French connection," arguing that the
passage (vv. 88-114) presents St. Louis (King Louis IX of France) in a
better light than is customarily perceived.  He admits that Enrico
Fenzi ("Tra religione e politica: Dante, il mal di Francia e le
'sacrate ossa' dell'esecrato san Luigi [con un excursus su alcuni passi
del ^Monarchia~]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 69 [2004]: 23-117) has offered a
strong argument against such a view, but presents it anyway.

	|115-117.~  The first of the apostrophes with which this canto
concludes is addressed (as will be the second) to the positive forces
in God's universal plan, first the tempering planet, just Jupiter.
This tercet offers a clear example of Dante's belief in astral
influence on earthly behaviors, with Jupiter conceived as the heavenly
shaper of human embodiments of justice.  See ^Paradiso~ VIII.97-99 and
VIII.122-126 and the appended notes.

Nancy Lenkeith's chapter "Jupiter and Justice" (^Dante and the Legend
of Rome~ [London: Warburg Institute, 1952], pp. 73-131) concludes with
a citation of this tercet.  She offers an evaluation of Dante's debt to
Cicero's Stoic statecraft (with which the poet is in accord except for
a total disavowal of its Godless theory of politics) and his total
disagreement with Augustine's theologically determined rejection of the
state's ability to have anything to do with "real justice" altogether.

	|118-136.~  The reader can hardly fail to notice the sudden and
sustained shift in the tense of the verbs (from past definite in verse
116) to present, some dozen and a half verbs in all, from ^prego~ (I pray [118]) to
^conosco~ (I know [136]).  The most dramatic is perhaps the
resurrective "are alive" ^(son vivi)~ for Saints Peter and Paul in
verse 132.  But the ostensible reason for the shift in tenses is clear:
Dante looks up from composing his text to see again the souls he had
previously seen in this sphere (we will meet them only in ^Par~. XX),
first among them David, those of just rulers, to pray for their
intervention with God to alleviate the civic distress of all on earth
who have been led astray by corrupt clergy, presided over by a corrupt
pope.  For reasons to believe that Dante here is thinking specifically
of the papacy and particularly of Pope John XXII, see the note to verse
130.  If there is a single moment that might disabuse those who manage
to believe that, once he enters the heavenly realm, Dante forgets about
such earthly concerns as politics, this might qualify as the most
compelling.

	|118-123.~  Now the poet turns his attention from this planetary home
of justice, where he was suspended, to God the Father, who is the
source of the justice that Jupiter rays down to earth, and prays that
He will observe the "smoke" that extinguishes those just rays before
they reach our world and will feel wrath at the offenders.

	|122-124.~  Each of these three verses is constructed from a different
verse of the Bible.  For the commerce in the temple, see Matthew 21:12;
for the bloody cost of building the Church out of sacrifice and
martyrdom, see Acts 20:28; for the heavenly militia, see Luke 2:13.

	|124.~  The second of the three concluding apostrophes is addressed to
the souls of the just rulers, whom he contemplates, as he writes these
words, in the Empyrean.  Nowhere in this passage does the poet rise to
a higher pitch of blissful contemplation than here, where he even now
"holds in mind" those whom he has previously seen in this heaven.  See
the note to vv. 118-136.

	|125.~  The word ^adora~ here does not have its more familiar meaning
("adore") but means "address a prayer to."

	|126.~  Surely Dante does not mean that all on earth are misled by
corrupt prelates; his negative enthusiasm runs away with him.  But he
clearly does mean to indicate the population of Italy (and others as well?)
that is misgoverned by the Church.

	|127-129.~  The "bread" that God the Father bars to none is generally
understood as the sacraments of the Church, and in this instance most
particularly the sacrament of the Eucharist.

Since it is the Church that "makes war" by denying the sacrament of
communion (an inevitable consequence of excommunication), in a better
age the Church (and not, as some commentators believe, ancient Roman
warriors) must have been brave on the field of battle.  Exactly what
Dante means by this is perhaps as puzzling as the commentaries have
allowed it to become.  However, in this very canto we have heard about
those worthies who battled against the soldiery of Mohammed in order to
regain the Holy Land, the Crusaders.  Is this an approving recollection
of the Crusades?  No commentator apparently thinks so, but that fact in
itself seems surprising.  (Commentators who do attempt to identify the
objects of these Christian weapons are content with a general sense,
heretics and/or pagans.)

	|130-136.~  The third and final apostrophe is hurled at the sitting
pope, and perhaps explains Dante's reasons for shifting out of the
normal "time zone" of the poem to a "now" in which Pope John XXII is
very much alive.  See the note to verse 130.

The rhythm of the three apostrophes is noteworthy, the first two
addressed to the temporary inhabitants of Jupiter and the permanent
residents of the Empyrean ^(O dolce stella,... O milizia del ciel)~,
lofty in tone; the last, brutally personal and in the casual intonation
not far removed from that of the gutter ^(Ma tu...)~.  This conclusion
of the canto is meant to be scabrous, because it is concerned with
scabrous deeds, the repeated selling of Christ for personal gain.
These verses offer what may be considered an appendix to ^Inferno~ XIX
(where we first met simoniac popes) in which we hear the sitting
pontiff, his words lent him by the acid-tongued Signor Alighieri,
sounding like a mobster in ^The Godfather~ or ^The Sopranos~, speak of
his dead "buddies," one who was killed (John the Baptist, whose image,
of course, adorns the florin) so that a political functionary could
watch a striptease performed by his stepdaughter, and another two (whom
we heard rightly named in the poet's voice just now, Peter and Paul)
disparagingly referred to as a fisherman and "Paulie" -- to whom he
greatly prefers the florin.

In a poem dedicated to the virtues of humility and to its vehicle of
expression, the low style of comedy, we learn that there are limits to
how low one should go.  Here Pope John XXII is focally presented as
being outrageously low in both his behaviors and his diction.

	|130.~  A probable reference to Pope John XXII, who acceded to the Holy
See in 1316 (he would survive in it for thirteen years past Dante's
death, until 1334).  John was not only French, but he decided to keep
the Church in France, in its Avignonian "captivity," thus managing to
draw Dante's ire.  It has seemed to some that this diatribe against
papal use of excommunication for political purpose is grounded in
John's excommunication of the imperial vicar Cangrande in 1317.  This
was the opinion of Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 128) and of Steiner
(comm. to this verse), possibly reprocessing the opinion of E.G. Parodi
(^BSDI~ 18 [1911], p. 73), cited by most of the fairly numerous later
commentators who mention this event.  Some try to date the writing of
this canto to a time later than 1317, which is not problematic; others
try to argue that this reference to Cangrande's excommunication
requires that we understand Dante still to have been in Verona.  That
is altogether possible, but not necessary.  Such an action would have
caught Dante's irate attention anywhere.

The last pope who had a speaking part in the poem was Adrian V, on his
way to Paradise, addressed by the protagonist with the honorific ^voi~
(^Purg~. XIX.131).  Now, in the poem called ^Paradiso~, we hear the
protagonist speak to the sitting pope, using the familiar ^tu~, in the
most disparaging terms and tone of voice.

	|131-132.~  Dante's threat to Pope John is advanced in two lines hinged
on the past tense of the verb "to die" ^(moriro[no])~ and culminating
in the triumphant assertion that the first keepers of the vineyard of
the Church, who gave their lives for it as martyrs, are indeed alive
^(vivi)~.  Peter and Paul (and John the Baptist, as we shall shortly
hear), for the pope and his cofunctionaries, are dead indeed; but not
for believers like Dante.

An extraordinarily helpful ^lectura~ of this canto, in English, has
just been brought to its conclusion by John A. Scott (February 2006).
Aimed at the English reader, it nonetheless deals with many of the
crucial issues encountered in the Italian.  It is scheduled to appear
in the so-called "California ^Lectura Dantis~"; however, if past
experience is any guide, one may have to be very patient indeed.  While
the series was announced in 1980, the ^Inferno~ volume only appeared in
1998; ^Purgatorio~ was finally announced for 2004, but as of this
writing has not appeared; and ^Paradiso~ lies open on the lap of the
gods, but we mortals have no such access.
