	|1-12.~  This warm-hued and extended simile opens a canto that has long
been admired as one of the most lyrical of the entire ^Commedia~.  It
contains more similes than any canto since ^Purgatorio~ XXX (which has
seven) and ^Paradiso~ XIV (eight), by merit of offering seven in all
(and two simple comparisons).  In contrast, the preceding two cantos
together offered only a single striking example (XXI.34-42).  When one
considers them, their burden unabashedly religious and explanatory, one
senses at once the differing register introduced by the presence here
of affective poetry.

The first nine verses of the simile portray a mother bird awaiting the
dawn so that she can find the food with which to feed her nestlings;
the final tercet makes the terms of the comparison clear: Beatrice
hopes soon to be able to nourish Dante with a vision of the final and
best thing knowable by humankind, eternal beatitude in the presence of
God.  Nonetheless, for all the resemblances (and few of Dante's similes
are as "neat" as this one) between mother bird and Beatrice, between
soon-to-be-awake, soon-to-be-satisfied nestlings and Dante, we also can
see that there is at least one crucial difference here as well.  In the
imagined earthly scene, the physical sun rises in the east; in the
reported scene in the eighth sphere, the metaphoric "sun" descends from
the zenith, a supernatural sun having risen at noon, as it were.
Dante's theologized "transvaluation of value," so crucial a part of his
strategy, especially in ^Paradiso~, following examples found in the
teaching of Jesus, is observable here.  What will the joys of Heaven be
like?  Like the pleasure of being fed, but having nothing to do with
eating; like the pleasure of the bride when her bridegroom comes to
her, but having nothing to do with sexuality; like the pleasure of
possessing great wealth, but having nothing to do with money.  A fine
American Dantist, Joseph Mazzeo, when teaching this ^cantica~ years
ago, used to enjoy deploying his own parable to make a similar point.
A Christian father is explaining to his child, curious about death,
that after this life there is another in Paradise, with God and the
saved, and that life there is completely happy, no one desiring
anything other than what is already in hand.  The child, not quite
convinced that death will be so satisfying a country, has a further
question: "But, Daddy, will there be ice cream in Paradise?"  Dante's
answer, imitating answers already found at hand in Christ's parables,
would not be apparently ascetic, but would allow us to keep our
prospective enjoyment of our human appetites intact even as we overcome
them.  It is a brilliant strategic coup, sublimation ^avant la lettre~.
 Mazzeo's parable needs to undergo a Dantean revision: "You like ice
cream?  O my child, the joys of Heaven are so much sweeter."

See Cesare Federico Goffis ("Canto XXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
p. 838) for notice of Dante's reliance here on Lactantius's ^De ave
Phoenice~, vv. 39-42, in the portrait of his mother bird, as was first
claimed by Enrico Proto (^BSDI~ 22 [1915], pp. 72-73).  This
attribution is now supported by a number of commentators.  The passage
presents the bird at the top of a tree, turned to where the sun will
rise and waiting for its rays.  However, for a lengthy discussion of
why the bird should be considered a nightingale (and not a lark), see
Maurizio Perugi ("Canto XXIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], pp. 364-67), with bibliography in the notes.  It is
something of a surprise that Lactantius's poem does not enter into his
discussion.  It is even more of one that Manlio Simonetti's article
"Lattanzio" (^ED~ III [1971]), while mentioning the poem, does not
report on its possible presence behind these verses.  For the possible
(if unlikely) presence of Lactantius as a character in the ^Commedia~,
see the note to ^Par~. X.118-120.  Some have objected that the phoenix,
as near-immortal bird, does not seem appropriate to this context and
deny its presence behind Dante's lines.  Lactantius, who lived into the
early fourth century, was imbued with the Christian faith, so much so
that he was hired by the emperor Constantine to instruct his children.
It is not certain he was in fact the author of the poem; what is
certain is that, as a Christian symbol (precisely of the reborn
Christ), the bird, whoever was its author, is appropriate to the
atmosphere of Dante's moment, preparing for a vision of Christ in His
flesh.

	|1.~  It seems entirely fitting that a canto centrally devoted to the
mother of Jesus begin with this image of the selfless and loving mother
bird.  Such is the retrograde nature of some commentators that they
debate whether this bird is meant to be taken as male or female.
Umberto Bosco (^Dante vicino~ [Caltanissetta: Sciascia, 1966], p. 347,
n. 5) demonstrates that, in the likely source found in the ^Fioretti~,
St. Francis addresses the model ^uccello~'s companions as ^sorores~
(sisters), thus probably offering those who need them grounds,
transcending mere good sense, upon which to settle the question.  While
it is true that the gender of the bird is not specified, and while male
birds do indeed care for nestlings, the context of the simile and of
the canto as a whole makes a father bird an otiose thought.

	|2.~  The phrase ^dolci nati~ (sweet brood) may have its origin in
Virgil, ^Georgics~ II.523, "dulces... nati," in that glowing tableau of
the bucolic life in the "good old days" of pre-Roman Italy.  Indeed, as
Bosco points out in his introductory note to this canto, there are many
classical references peeking out at us from these lines, including that
one.  Apparently the first to cite this passage in the ^Georgics~ was
Scartazzini (comm. to this verse); see also Aristide Marigo ("Le
^Georgiche~ di Virgilio fonte di Dante," ^Giornale dantesco~ 17 [1909]:
31-44).

	|3.~  For the blackness of the night that hides things from view,
Tommaseo was the first to point to Virgil (^Aen~. VI.271-272): "ubi
caelum condidit umbra / Iuppiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem"
(when Jupiter has buried the sky in shade, and black Night has stolen
from the world her hues [tr. H.R. Fairclough]).

	|4.~  There seems no reason to honor the views of those who see in the
^aspetti dis,iati~ anything other than the "faces" of the nestlings.
Yet some believe that the phrase refers to the locations of nourishment
for the young birds or even the "aspects" of the soon-to-rise Sun.

As Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 4-6) points out, words for "desire" and
"desiring" occur four times in this canto (see also vv. 14, 39, 105).

	|7.~  The bird now ventures from the nest farther along the branch,
where the leaves are less thick, in order to have a better view of
sunrise.

	|9.~  For the medieval ^alba~ (a love-song, lamenting the coming of
dawn, sung to one's beloved after a night of lovemaking), see Jonathan
Saville (^The Medieval Erotic "Alba"~ [New York: Columbia University
Press, 1972]).  And see Picone ("Miti, metafore e similitudini del
^Paradiso~: un esempio di lettura," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1989 {1994}]:
211-13) for the relevance also of the religious ^alba~.  Picone points
out that in Dante's scene the dawn is a welcome presence, betiding the
renewal of affection rather than the sad time of necessary separation
for lovers.

	|10-11.~  This language for Beatrice's attitude recalls that found in
^Purgatorio~ XIX.26, where Beatrice (if that is she in Dante's dream),
is ^santa e presta~ (holy and alert); in that dream it is Dante who
makes "straight" the deformed witch he wants to love.

	|11-12.~  Unriddled, these lines indicate the heavenly equivalent of
noon on earth, the zenith of the universe.  We remember that the
physical sun lies ^below~ the place where Dante finds himself.
Beatrice is expecting "sunrise" there, at the zenith, not at the
"horizon."  The descent of the blessed spirits of the Empyrean,
naturally, is from "true north," the very top of the universe.
Lombardi points out (comm. to these verses) that the heavenly Jerusalem
is directly over the earthly one; this "supernatural sunrise" calls our
attention to the fact that the "sun" that is about to "dawn" is indeed
extraordinary.

	|12.~  The Sun at its zenith seems to "move" more slowly because it
covers the smaller part of its arc, as seen by us; see Tozer (comm. to
^Purg~. XXXIII.103-105): "At noon the sun is brightest, and the
imagination naturally conceives that it pauses or slackens its speed
when it reaches the highest point of its course."

	|13-18.~  Dante, as nestling, must await his "food."  Like the subject
it describes, delayed satisfaction both for giver and recipient, the
passage continues to draw out that moment of satisfaction, until the
"sun" is finally described as having risen.

	|19-21.~  While a great deal of preparation has led up to this moment
(and it should now be clear that it is this moment that necessitated
the invocation in the last canto), it is nonetheless a vast surprise,
once we realize that what has just occurred is a "visit" by the entire
Church Triumphant to the second of the heavenly spheres beneath the
placeless, timeless Empyrean.  There the object of their "visit" is no
other and no more than Dante Alighieri, "a Florentine by birth but not
in his behaviors."  There are few moments in the poem, not even the
final vision of the triune God, that come close to reaching the level
of daring found here.  However, for a barely controlled outburst
against those commentators who believe this, see Porena (comm. to this
tercet); according to him, there appear here only souls subjected to
the influence of the stars in this realm, and thus ^not~ those we have
seen in the preceding seven heavens, each group of whom was subject to
the influence of the first seven heavens, Moon through Saturn.  That
may look like a reasonable, sensible, even a correct formulation.  The
problem is that Porena is confused about the roles of the various
heavens in the shaping of our human propensities.  He might have
learned from Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to this tercet) that: "the
eighth sphere, as is affirmed in the second Canto and elsewhere,
distributes its power through the spheres of the lower planets."
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 13-24) shares this understanding, as do
some other subsequent commentators.  For a summary of the three major
"schools" of interpretation of this tercet, see Scartazzini (comm. to
vv. 20-21).

The saved who dwell with Christ are thought of as the souls that have
been harvested by Him (some in the Harrowing [see ^Inf~. IV.52-63],
slightly fewer than half of them later), in part because of the
positive qualities bred in them by the stars at their birth.  Aversano
(^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent
by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 104, suggests that the descent
of these souls from the Empyrean may mimic that described in the
Apocalypse (Apoc. 21:2), "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God,..." ^(descendentem de coelo a
Deo)~.  (Tommaseo is apparently the only other commentator ever to
advert to this passage with reference to this canto, and he does so
only at vv. 118-120.)

There has been and remains dispute as to who exactly comes down to be
seen by Dante.  Some embarrassment is felt on the poet's behalf had he
wanted the reader to believe that all the saints in Heaven came down to
greet him.  Embarrassing or not, that seems the only possible reading:
^tutto il frutto~ (all the fruit) does not allow for a more modest,
gentlemanly selectivity.

We are forced also to reflect that Dante has seen some of these souls
before.  If all of them now descend, their number includes all the
souls since Piccarda whom he has already seen in the various seven
previous heavens.  (It is not surprising that the poet does not insist
on this fact.)  Poor Benedict, just having made his way back to the
Great Monastery atop the heavens being informed that it's time to head
back down for yet another glimpse of the Florentine visitor.  No rest for the
joyful.

Why did Dante choose to live so dangerously among us, his readers?  And
why did he choose this particular place for this extraordinary first
vision of the Empyrean (since he has not yet reached it, it comes down
to him)?  No commentator in the DDP has noted what surely other readers
have, that this canto is most propitiously "numbered."  No, not
twenty-three, but ninety.  As the ninetieth canto of the poem, this is
the fitting place both for Beatrice to make her final unveiling and
present herself not as accommodating mirror but as herself (nine is,
after all, "her number") and for the other saints to make themselves
seen.  For another and similar numerological hypothesis, see the note
to ^Par~. XXIII.90.

	|20.~  For a meditation on the "triumph of Christ" announced by
Beatrice, see Renzo Lo Cascio ("Il canto XXIII del ^Paradiso~," ^Nuove
letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le Monnier, 1974], pp. 76-92).

	|22-24.~  The by-now customary (and, within the poet's strategy,
necessary) upward gradation in Beatrice's joy as she gets nearer her
God may seem more justified here than at other times.  She is now once
more in the presence of those with whom she shares Eternity; and now
for the first time she is accompanied by her Dante.  She is "home," and
escorting Dante to his home as well.

	|24.~  The phrase ^sanza costrutto~ ("without putting it in words") is
a bit unusual.  For more on ^costrutto~, see the note to ^Paradiso~
XII.67.  Mattalia (comm. to this verse) explains that it means "the
parts and elements of 'discourse'" and goes on to suggest that, in ^De
vulgari eloquentia~, Dante refers to it as ^constructio~, that is, the
building blocks of language.  The word appears four other times in the
poem (see ^Inf~. XI.30; ^Purg~. XXVIII.147; ^Par~. XII.67; P^ar~.
XXIX.31).  Its use this many times may reflect the fact that it happens
to rhyme with ^tutto~.

	|25-30.~  The second simile in the canto compares the Moon, when it is
largest and brightest, surrounded by the other astral presences, to
this "sun," irradiating the host of the blessed.  There can be no doubt
as to what this "sun" is.  For here Dante is looking at (if unable to
see) the living light that is Jesus Christ, like His mother, present
here in the resurrected flesh worn, at least now, before the General
Resurrection, by them alone.  Some commentators, perhaps puzzled by the
strange and lone occurrence in which the assembled citizenry of the
Empyrean descends as a unit to the nether heavens, believe that this
"sun" is a "symbol" of Christ; however, we are meant to understand that
it ^is~ Christ (see the note to vv. 31-33).  Here is Jacopo della Lana
(comm. to these verses) on this passage: "Or qui d@a esemplo come la
substanzia della umanit@a di Cristo, ch'era sopra tutti li predetti
beati, luceva pi@u di tutti, e tutti li illuminava, simile a questo
sensibile sole, che illumina tutti li corpi celesti" (Now [Dante] here
gives an example of how the substance of the humanity of Christ, which
was above all the aforementioned blessed souls, shone more brightly
than all of them, and illumined them all, just as does this material
Sun, which illumines all the heavenly bodies).

	|25-27.~  For Trivia, the Moon, see Picone ("Miti, metafore e
similitudini del ^Paradiso~: un esempio di lettura," ^Studi Danteschi~
63 [1989 {1994}], pp. 213-17).  He insists on a source, not in Horace
or Virgil, as is proposed by some, but in Ovid (^Metam~. III.138-252).
Picone's treatment of Dante's interpretation of Actaeon resembles
Brownlee's reading of his Semele (see the note to ^Par~. XXI.5-12); it
is a subversive reading of the "tragic" original, in which Actaeon is
torn apart by his own hounds.  Now Dante/Actaeon finds a better
resolution.

For a study of the formal elements of this tercet, see Aldo Scaglione
("Imagery and Thematic Patterns in ^Paradiso~ XXIII," in ^From Time to
Eternity: Essays on Dante's "Divine Comedy,"~ ed. T.G. Bergin [New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1967], pp. 157-72).

	|31-33.~  The resurrected body of Christ shines down upon Dante's
blinded eyes.  Singleton, who on seven separate occasions in his
comments to this canto insists that what we witness of Christ's
presence is not to be taken literally but "symbolically," here (comm.
to vv. 31-32) believes that "^Sustanza~ is used in the scholastic sense
(^substantia~), denoting that which has separate existence, as
contrasted with 'accident,' which is a quality existing in a substance.
 See Dante's use of these terms in ^Vita nuova~ XXV.1-2.  With this
term the stress is rather on the human Christ.  The whole vision is
symbolic, however -- a point not to be forgotten."  In fact "the whole
vision" is to be taken as the most "real" experience Dante has yet had,
as any such seeing of Christ in His flesh would have to be.

	|34.~  In a single verse Dante culminates his long and varying
experience of Beatrice in this recognition of what her guidance has
meant and where it has finally led him.  When she came to him as
^mediatrix~, one whose being was imprinted by Christ in order to lead
him back to his Savior, he was often uncertain.  Now the identity
between them is finally sensed on his pulses, and he is properly
grateful.  This is a line that many readers find themselves greatly
moved by, without perhaps being able to verbalize the reasons for their
emotion.  It was amazing, he must reflect, that she had faith in such
as him.

For an essay on the relationship between Beatrice and Virgil as Dante's
guides, see Arianna Punzi ("'Oh Beatrice, dolce guida e cara!'
[^Paradiso~ XXIII, v. 34]," ^Critica del testo~ 2 [1999]: 771-99).  For
the sense that Dante, here and elsewhere, has totally revised his
earlier and earthly sense of Beatrice, see Paolo Cherchi ("Dante e i
trovatori," in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence:
Cesati, 2004], p. 99): "This is the true praise.  Beatrice loses
nothing of her physical beauty; indeed, she remains the most fair among
the fair.  However, the 'diseroticization,' so to speak, comes... from
Dante, who comes to understand, at a certain point in his narrative,
that the lady whom he desires is truly 'venuta da cielo in terra a
miracol mostrare'" (come from Heaven to earth to reveal a miracle --
^VN~ XXVI.6).

Franco Masciandaro's ^lectura~ of this canto ("^Paradiso~ XXIII," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [Lectura Dantis {virginiana} 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp. 329-51)
demonstrates the importance of aesthetic concerns throughout this
particularly beautiful canto.

	|35.~  For the only other use of the Proven$calism ^sobranza~
(overwhelms), see the note to ^Paradiso~ XX.97.

	|37-39.~  Beatrice's discourse leaves little doubt but that she and
Dante are gazing on Jesus Himself.  See I Corinthians 1:24, Paul's
description of Christ as "the power of God and the Wisdom of God."

	|39.~  It was 4302 years that Adam waited for Christ to harrow him from
Limbo.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVI.118-120.

	|40-45.~  The third simile of the canto compares the swelling lightning
bolt, escaping from the cloud that can no longer contain it, and
falling, against its nature, downward, to Dante's mind, swelling with
its rapt vision of Christ, escaping from its "container," and becoming
other than it had been.

Dante's meteorology (for this phenomenon Steiner [comm. to vv. 40-42]
cites Albertus Magnus, ^Meteor~. I.iv.7) held that lightning resulted
when contention between fiery and aquatic elements within a cloud
resulted in the fiery part becoming too large and bursting the edges of
the acqueous envelope, as it were.  Theorists of the phenomenon were
hard pressed to explain ^why~ this excess of fire should, only in this
instance, fall downward rather than follow its natural inclination up.

	|43.~  The noun ^dape~ (Latin ^dapes~, viands), a hapax in the poem,
shows Dante's hand once again being forced by rhyme.   Lombardi (comm.
to this verse) refers to the hymn composed by St. Ambrose, describing a
saintly man who thus "dapes supernas obtinet" (obtains supernal food).

	|45.~  It seems clear that the author wishes us to understand that the
protagonist, blinded by Christ, has had a Pauline (or Johannine)
^raptus~.

	|46-48.~  Dante's vision has now readied him, if not to see Christ in
His splendor, then at least to be able to have a version of that
experience with respect to Beatrice.  Heretofore, she has made herself
his mirror (e.g., ^Par~. XVIII.13-18); now she invites him to see her
as herself; in the previous sphere (^Par~. XXI.4-12, XXI.63,
XXII.10-11) he was denied her smile (which he last saw in Mars [^Par~.
XVIII.19]).  Now he possesses the capacity to behold her true being,
since his experience of the Church Triumphant under Christ has raised
his ability to deal with such lofty things.

As Kevin Brownlee points out ("Ovid's Semele and Dante's Metamorphosis:
^Paradiso~ 21-22," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991], pp. 230-31), this marks the
completion of the "Semele program" ^in bono~, Dante's being able to
look upon his "goddess" in her true nature.

	|49-51.~  The tercet, while offering a simple comparison rather than,
strictly speaking, a simile (see, e.g., ^Par~. XXII.2-3, 4-6 for like
phenomena), continues the similetic tonality of the canto.  Here we
find another comparison involving a state of mind (see the note to
^Inf~. XXX.136-141).  We may be reminded both of Dante's final vision
of Beatrice in Christ in ^Vita nuova~ XLII and (if we have already read
this poem at least once) of the final vision in ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.  In
both those cases, as here, there is at stake a ^visione~ that cannot be
brought back to consciousness.  In all three cases we are speaking of
what is clearly presented as a true vision, not a dream, even if here
this is ^compared~ to an ordinary dreamer's attempt to revive in
himself the experience of the dream from which he has awakened.  Our
task as interpreters of text is not made easier by the fact that in
Dante's Italian both ordinary dreaming and privileged sight of the
highest kind may be signified by the same word, ^visione~.  For an
attempt to demonstrate how carefully Dante developed and deployed
necessary distinctions in his vocabulary of seeing as early as in his
^Vita nuova~, see Hollander ("^Vita Nuova~: Dante's Perceptions of
Beatrice," ^Dante Studies~ 92 [1974]: 1-18).

In the last tercet the poet has used the verb ^vedere~ to register
Dante's vision of Jesus, the "sun" that is too bright for him as yet to
take in; Beatrice invites him to look upon ^her~ as she truly is (if he
cannot yet sustain a vision of Christ).  He had never before enjoyed,
in the narrative of her presence in the ^Commedia~, from ^Purgatorio~
XXX until right now, such beholding of Beatrice "face-to-face."
However, it seems probable that we are meant to consider that she was
present to his vision in an at least approximately similar
manifestation in the last chapter of the ^Vita nuova~.  And thus this
moment is meant to draw that one back to mind.  There, too, Beatrice
was a living soul in the presence of God.

	|50.~  Poletto (comm. to vv. 49-54) notes that this hapax, the Latinism
^oblita~ (forgotten, faded from memory) is deployed in the ^Epistola a
Cangrande~ (XIII.80).  The context of that passage is perhaps
remembered here: "This again is conveyed to us in Matthew, where we
read that the three disciples fell on their faces, and record nothing
thereafter, as though memory had failed them ^(quasi obliti)~.  And in
Ezechiel it is written: 'And when I saw it, I fell upon my face.'  And
should these not satisfy the cavillers, let them read Richard of St.
Victor in his book ^On Contemplation~; let them read Bernard in his
book ^On Consideration~; let them read Augustine in his book ^On the
Capacity of the Soul~; and they will cease from their cavilling" (tr.
P. Toynbee).  Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of these texts (particularly
those of Richard of St. Victor and of Bernard) have been before our
eyes in notes to the last contemplative heaven.  This portion of the
^Epistola~ (XIII.77-84) is a fairly lengthy commentary on ^Paradiso~
I.7-9.  The context is supplied by the extramundane experiences of Paul
and Dante, those uniquely favored humans who had seen God in their
ascent to the Empyrean.

	|52-53.~  Beatrice's "offer" to let Dante see her face-to-face,
as she truly is, that is, blessed in the company of the elect, is the
greatest gift she has ever bestowed on Dante.  Among other things, it
promises his own blessedness to come, for how would God sanction such
a vision to a mortal bound to perdition?  Cf. ^VN~ XIX.8, from ^Donne
ch'avete intelletto d'amore~, "O mal nati, / io vidi la speranza de'
beati."

	|54.~  The language here, too, puts us in mind of the ^Vita nuova~, now
of the opening reference (^VN~ I.1) to Dante's ^libro della mia
memoria~ (book of my memory), in which Beatrice's significant presences
are recorded.  Strangely enough, because the self-citation does seem
obvious, surprisingly few (ten) commentators to ^Paradiso~ XXIII refer
to the ^Vita nuova~ as being focally present behind the phrasing of
verse 54.  Once again the first is Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 52-54).

	|55-60.~  Not even if all the most inspired (pagan) poets, inspired by
all the Muses (led, in this consideration, by Polyhymnia, the one
associated with sacred song), should come to Dante's aid, would that
serve to reveal more than a tiny bit of the Christian truth he now saw
in Beatrice.  There is a small dispute between Hollander ("The
Invocations of the ^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of Italian Studies~ 3 [1976]:
235-40) and Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp.
41-42) as to how to regard this "non-invocation."  Hollander insists
that it betokens a dramatic rejection of the classical Muses, while
Ledda sees it as part of a gradual program for downgrading their
importance.  The fact is, however, that, with a single exception, the
Muses have not been part of an invocation since they were referred to
by name or by clear periphrasis ^(quelle donne~ or ^sacrosante Vergini)
~in all four of the invocations in the first two canticles.  And there
is only one later one that involves a Muse.  However, it also happens
that most commentators think that the reference to ^diva Pegas,ea~ is
^not~ a reference to one of the nine Muses (if the present writer is
convinced that it is: see the notes to ^Par~. XVIII.82-87 and
XVIII.82).  Once we reach the Empyrean (or its "outpost" in this canto)
it may seem fair to refer to what happens in this passage as comprising
"a fervent non-invocation," the phrasing that triggered Ledda's
objection.  There happen to be in the poem nine invocations (no more
than five of them addressed to traditional Muses) and nine references
to the Muses; see Hollander ("The Invocations of the ^Commedia~,"
^Yearbook of Italian Studies~ 3 [1976]: 235-40, n. 3), who also offers
an account of the inaccuracies of Muse-counting from 1896-1973, from
Scartazzini to Singleton.  And now see ^The Dante Encyclopedia~ (ed.
Richard Lansing [(New York: Garland, 2000], which has no entry for
"invocations" but has one for "Muses, the," which may mercifully be
described as confused, undercounting invocations (three) and
overcounting presences of the Muses (thirteen).  Since we have known
for a long time of the importance of the number nine to Dante, this
failed accounting is surprising.  But see Hollander's belated
discussion (in his later version of this article ["The Tragedy of
Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ {Ravenna: Longo,
1980}, p. 32, n. 1a) of Fabio Fabbri ("Le invocazioni nella ^Divina
Commedia~," ^Giornale dantesco~ 18 [1910]: 186), who lists the nine
invocations correctly.

For strong claims for a greater than usually perceived reliance, in
this passage, on Horace (to the exclusion of Cicero) for the formal
matters of Dante's ^ars poetriae~, see Zygmunt Baranski ("Three Notes
on Dante and Horace," ^Reading Medieval Studies~ 27 [2001]: 5-37).

For this trope (nursing Muses) as it is developed in the (only
slightly?) later ^Eclogues~, see Andreas Heil ("Die Milch der Musen,"
^Antike und Abenland~ 49 [2003]: 113-29).  And see Gary Cestaro (^Dante
and the Grammar of the Nursing Body~ [Notre Dame: University of Notre
Dame Press, 2003], pp. 139, 162, 166) for the Muses as nourishing in
^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~.

	|55-57.~  It has become fairly usual (beginning with Tommaseo [comm. to
this tercet]) for commentators to cite ^Aeneid~ VI.625-627, for
example, Poletto (comm. to vv. 55-60): "No, had I a hundred tongues, a
hundred mouths, and voice of iron, I could not sum up all the forms of
crime, or rehearse all the tale of torments" [tr. H.R. Fairclough].
The Sibyl is here reacting to what she and Aeneas might have seen had
they entered Tartarus instead of proceeding to the Elysian Fields.
Since we are seeing the inhabitants of the Christian version of those
"fields," the passage in the ^Aeneid~ seems doubly apt.  For the view
that ^Georgics~ II.42-46 is still closer to Dante's passage (and
includes the word ^ambages~ found at ^Par~. XVII.31), see Mario
Aversano ("Cultura e immagine: intertestualit@a dantesco-virgiliana,"
^L'Alighieri~ 27 [1986]: 22).

	|56.~  Polyhymnia is mentioned as one of the nine Muses by all the
early commentators; most of them go on to identify her with memory
rather than a specific artistic form, as she is in handbooks today
(with the sacred hymn).  The first commentator to associate her with
hymns was Andreoli (comm. to vv. 55-57), etymologizing her Greek name;
with him she becomes, for the modern commentary tradition, the Muse "of
many hymns."

	|61-63.~  Read as literally as it probably should be, Dante's remark
indicates that his poem ^right now~ is "representing Paradise," and
doing so for the very first time.  That is why he required a
preparatory invocation (^Par~. XXII.121-123) for this portion of the
poem (now combined with an at least equally attention-summoning
"non-invocation, vv. 55-63).  True Paradise is found only, one may
respond, after ^Paradiso~ XXX.90, once Dante begins to see the courts
of Heaven as they are.  However, singularly and strikingly, it is here,
in the Fixed Stars, that he is allowed to see those who dwell there,
whom he will see again once he himself has reached the Empyrean.  In
this vein, among many, see Cesare Federico Goffis ("Canto XXIII," in
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1968], p. 826), referring to this canto as beginning the
"second part" of ^Paradiso~.  However, see Benvenuto da Imola, for the
kind of misapprehension that dogs him whenever Dante represents himself
as having looked upon reality.  Here is Benvenuto's response to this
tercet: "^figurando il paradiso~, that is, representing poetically,
figuratively; for this passage does not represent real things...."

Scartazzini (comm. to verse 61) documents the confusion caused by these
lines: If "figurando il paradiso" means "representing [true] paradise,"
that is, the Church Triumphant, citizenry of the Empyrean (and that is
not everyone's understanding, if it seems to be a just one), then why
does the "sacred poem" indeed "have to make a leap"?  There is a fairly
straightforward interpretation: The poem "overleaps" an intervening
heaven, the Primum Mobile, in finding its subject matter in those who
inhabit the Empyrean.  It is in that sense that he is like a man "who
finds his path obstructed" and has to leap over the impediment.

Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) puts it into relationship with
^Inferno~ XXXII.9, where Dante is concerned with the difficulty of
describing the bottom of the universe (here, with the top of it).
There we find, immediately following this expression of concern, an
invocation; here, immediately preceding an expression of similar
difficulty, a non-invocation.

For a meditation loosely based in this tercet, see Teodolinda Barolini
(^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1992]), pp. 218-46).

	|61.~  In the ^Commedia~ the word ^paradiso~ has only a single presence
outside the ^cantica~ that bears its name (^Purg~. I.99).  Its first
clear reference to the Empyrean (rather than to the celestial regions
in general) perhaps occurs only in its sixth appearance, in ^Paradiso~
(XV.36).

	|64-66.~  This is an "indirect address to the reader," as it were; for
the extent of the real kind in the poem, see the notes to ^Inferno~
VIII.94-96 and ^Paradiso~ X.22-27.

Daniello, Lombardi, Tommaseo, Scartazzini, Torraca (all in their
comments on this tercet) cite Horace's much-quoted passage ("sumite
materiam") from his ^Ars poetica~ (vv. 38-41): "Take a subject, you
writers, equal to your strength, and ponder long what your shoulders
refuse, and what they are able to bear.  Whoever shall choose a theme
within his range, neither speech will fail him, nor clearness of order"
(tr. H.R. Fairclough).  Torraca reminds the reader that Dante had
earlier cited this passage in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (II.iv.4).

The altogether possible pun on Homer's name, unrecorded in the
commentaries, in Dante's rephrasing of Horatian ^humerus~ (shoulder) as
^@omero mortal~ (mortal shoulder), since ^Om@ero~ is Homer's name in
Italian (see ^Inf~. IV.88), was noted in the 1970s by Professor Janet
Smarr, while she was a graduate student at Princeton.  That Dante may
have for a moment thought of himself as the "Italian Homer" would not
come as a surprise.  If he did, the profoundly famous Homer (see
Horace, ^Ars poetica~ 401: ^insignis Homerus~), by any stretch of the
imagination "immortal," has an Italian counterpart in the very mortal
Dante.  For Dante's earlier reference to a Homeric being seeming like a
god (and thus immortal), see ^Vita nuova~ II.8, perhaps a reference to
Nausicaa in the ^Odyssey~, but for Dante, who is citing indirectly,
without precise Homeric identity.

	|67-69.~  This tercet, recapping the nautical imagery that shapes the
beginnings of each of the last two canticles of the poem, allows us to
realize that, in some real sense, Dante put forward this canto as a
liminal space, at the border of the infinite, as it were.  In that
perspective, the text that follows directly after this one is the final
third of ^Paradiso~ XXX, where we are again in the direct presence of
Eternity. And thus the necessity of a narrative 'leap.'

These verses pick up various thematic elements from earlier in the
poem.  For the "little bark" with its unworthy readers, see ^Paradiso~
II.1; for the ^Commedia~ as a ^legno~, see ^Paradiso~ II.3; for the
angelic steersman as ^celestial nocchiero~, see ^Purgatorio~ II.43.  We
 have progressed to that point at which the poet has himself become the
pilot who will not spare himself in guiding us to our heavenly
destination.

Is this tercet a boundary stone for a "fourth part" of the ^Commedia~,
consisting in Dante's experience of the Empyrean, begun here, only to
be interrupted by six more cantos that take place in the last two
spheres?

	|67.~  The word ^pareggio~ has caused difficulty.  Its other use in the
poem (^Par~. XXI.90) has not seemed problematic to the commentators (it
is a verb form meaning "I match" or "I equal").  Here, on the other
hand, where it is a predicate nominative, it has caused traffic jams.
The value of the word in its two most favored forms (there have been as
many as seven candidates at one time or another) is close enough that
one may say that the difference is not worth a large investment of
effort: Some sense of a voyage over an extensive piece of sea is what
most think is meant, however they arrive at their conclusion.  See the
note to ^Par~. XXIII.67-69.

	|70-75.~  That the protagonist is looking upon the Church Triumphant is
beyond question, despite occasional shilly-shallying about how many of
the saved are represented as having come down to be seen by Dante
(since Beatrice's words at verse 20 make it plain that all are here).
The question that remains is ^why~ the poet engineered this
extraordinary scene.  The commentators have not ventured an opinion,
perhaps because they do not fully take in what an extraordinary moment
this is.  It is simply amazing to find that all the blessed have
appeared in space in the Starry Sphere, that is, before we enter the
Empyrean.  One might counter that this is similar to their appearances
through the spheres.  But there they came as "emissaries" of
themselves; now they ^are~ themselves (without, of course, their
flesh), and are arranged as they shall be for eternity.  For a precise
understanding of the difference, see Italo Borzi ("Il Canto XXIV," in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-'81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989], p. 644): "Il Canto XXIII del ^Paradiso~ segna il
passaggio dalla rappresentazione dei beati distribuiti, per ragioni
didattiche, nei sette cieli, alla visione di un Paradiso c@olto nella
realt@a teologica della sua unit@a" (Canto XXIII marks the passage from
the representation of the blessed souls distributed, for didactic
reasons, through the seven heavens, to the vision of a Paradise caught
in the theological reality of its oneness).

	|71.~  The word ^giardino~ (garden), absent from the poem since
^Purgatorio~ VI.105, where it was used in the phrase "the garden of the
empire," now, referring to the members of the Church Triumphant,
reappears.  It will do so again at ^Paradiso~ XXVI.110, where it refers
to the garden of Eden, and then in XXXI.97 and XXXII.39, where it will
signify the Empyrean, Eden regained.

	|73-75.~  We hear that there are at least two kinds of flowers in this
"garden" (verse 71).  The single rose, by common consent, is Mary; the
lilies, if with considerably less unanimous support (see, for instance,
Lino Pertile ["Stile e immagini in ^Paradiso~ XXIII," ^The Italianist~
4 {1984}, pp. 32-33 {n. 12}]), represent the apostles, leading
humankind toward salvation in Christ (along "the right way").  Pertile,
citing two passages in Saint Bernard's ^Sermones in Cantica
Canticorum~, argues that they probably refer to all the blessed in the
Rose.  See Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 74) on three reasons for
identifying the lilies with the apostles: (1) because lilies are white
(signifying faith), vermilion in their inner petals (signifying
incorruptibility and charity), and fragrant (signifying preaching and
hope).  As early as Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to this tercet),
however, there was a wider understanding abroad: Pietro thought the
lilies represented "the apostles and the other saints," much as would
Pertile.  Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 70-87) says that the lilies
represent "the apostles, the Doctors [of the Church], and all of the
blessed souls."  Landino (comm. to vv. 73-74) thought of apostles,
Doctors, and martyrs, as did Vellutello (comm. to this tercet), but
putting these three in a historically more correct order, apostles,
martyrs, and Doctors.  Indeed, the context of the tercet would seem to
limit the "lilies" to those who taught Christian doctrine to others,
either by word or example, and thus perhaps not include all the
inhabitants of the Rose, but more of them than the apostles.  Similar
interpretations mark the landscape of the commentaries into the early
nineteenth century.  However, beginning with Andreoli (comm. to vv.
74-75), there occurred one of those unaccountable shifts back to the
earliest gloss (Lana's): the reference is, and is only, to the
apostles.  In the last two centuries there have only been a half dozen
or so "dissenters," the most recent of whom was Sapegno (comm. to vv.
73-74), but there is a compact majority supporting the oldest hypothesis.

	|78.~  For a second time (see ^Par~. XXIII.31-33), the brightness of
Jesus overwhelms Dante's ability to look at Him.  (The line literally
means "the battle of the weak brows.")

	|79-84.~  The precondition for this simile, as we finally will realize
in verse 86, is that Jesus has withdrawn, going back up to the
Empyrean.  And so now He, as the Sun, shines through a rift in clouds
and illuminates a spot of earth, representing, resolved from the
simile, the host of Christ's first triumph (the Harrowing) and the
souls of all those saved after that.

The mechanisms of display of the Church Triumphant manifest in this
canto urge at least two perhaps unanswerable questions upon us: (1)
Why did Dante choose to have the host of the blessed descend to the
Starry Sphere?  (2) Why did he decide to allow us this "foretaste" of
the final sense of the ultimate reality that Canto XXXIII will bring us?
It is not enough to say (as has been said above) that this ninetieth
canto of the poem is numerically propitious.  His tactic here calls
so much attention to itself that one might say that Dante has chosen
to live very, very dangerously.  This event, unheard of in any form of
Christian writing, the Church Triumphant descending back into the world
of time (and for the education of a single failed Tuscan politician!),
really seems, even from a poet not known for his restraint, excessive.

	|82-84.~  On a beam of light passing through a cloud as an expression
of Dante's light physics, see Simon Gilson (^Medieval Optics and
Theories of Light in the Works of Dante~ [Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen
Press, 2000], pp. 150-69).  Patrick Boyde (^Perception and passion in
Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993], pp.
67-68) deals with its three prime elements: ^luce~ (the source of
light), ^lumen~ (in Dante's Italian, ^raggio~, the beam along which the
^luce~ travels), ^splendor[e]~ (the surface that the light irradiates).
 Perhaps nowhere else in the poem is this arrangement articulated so
neatly, each element receiving one line in the tercet, but that is not
to say it is not often present.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XII.9.

	|85-87.~  Christ, addressed as His paternal attribute, Power, is now
thanked by the poet for having made, by withdrawing, his experience of
the scene possible.  His overwhelming light, which is compared to the
sun being present only through a chink in the clouds (His "ray" that
illuminates the resplendent flowers in a field without blinding the
onlooker by shining full on him as well), is thus only resplendent on
the souls that constitute the "garden" of the Church Triumphant.  For
some readers, this is the most beautiful and memorable simile in the
poem - and no wonder.

	|88-89.~  This passage brings out emotional responses in even hardened
commentators, as demonstrated by a quick sampling of their responses to
it in the DDP.  And surely they are correct in thinking that Dante is
revealing a personal trait, what a stern Protestant would describe,
with perhaps an Anglo-Saxon ^harrumph~, as "Mariolatry."  This is,
nonetheless, one of the few touches in the poem that allow us to feel
the presence of an ordinary human being beneath the writer's words (we
often are allowed to share Dante's thoughts, only rarely his doings),
one who is occupied with the details of daily living, praying to the
Intercessor before he descends the stairs in a stranger's house and
then again after he climbs them in the evening (see ^Par~. XVII.60).
And, for discussion of another similar moment in the poem, see the note
to ^Inf~. XXXII.70-72.

	|90.~  For the significance of Mary's appearing to be greater in size
than the other saints, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXII.28-29.  This
ninetieth verse of the ninetieth canto celebrates Mary as the largest
figure in Paradise.  Is Dante deliberately managing the numbers here?
See the note to vv. 19-21.

	|91-102.~  This little scene reflects a genre familiar from paintings
of the time, an Annunciation, with its two familiar figures, the
archangel Gabriel and the mother of Jesus.  It ends with the canonical
color for Mary, her earmark glowing blue.  Porena (comm. to vv.
106-108), however, denies that the angelic presence here is that of
Gabriel, urging rather the candidacy of an unnamed Seraph.

	|93.~  Mary is as elevated over all the other saints in Heaven as she
exceeded in virtue all other living beings while she was on earth.

	|95.~  For the Virgin's crown, created by Gabriel's circling, see
Carroll (comm. to vv. 91-108): "Aquinas distinguishes between the
^essential bliss~ of heaven and the ^accidental reward~.  The essential
bliss he calls the ^corona aurea~, or simply ^aurea~; and the
accidental reward, ^aureola~, a diminutive of ^aurea.~  All saints in
the Fatherland receive the ^aurea~, the essential bliss of perfect
union of the soul with God; but the ^aureola~, or accidental reward, is
given only to those who, in the earthly warfare, have won an excellent
victory over some special foe: virgins, martyrs, and doctors and
preachers [^Summa~, Supp., q. xcvi, a. 1]."

	|97-102.~  Similetic in its feeling, this passage does without the
trope's traditional markers but surely has telling effect: "Ave Maria,"
for instance, would sound like a cloud crackling with thunder if
compared with the "song" created by the angelic affection for Mary.

	|100.~  While the poet never explicitly says that Gabriel is singing,
he makes it clear that the angel is indeed doing so by referring to him
as a "lyre."

	|103-108.~  The Starry Sphere is the one most characterized by singing.
 (For the program of song in the last ^cantica~, see the note to ^Par~.
XXI.58-60.)  These words, which are attributable to none other than
Gabriel (one notices that the poet's reticence forces the reader both
to identify him and to understand that he is singing) are, perhaps
surprisingly, the only words spoken (or sung) by a specific angel in
this canticle.  Cf. the only ones spoken by an angel in ^Inferno~
(^Inf~. IX.91-99).  (There are many angelic verbal interventions as
part of the ceremonies of ^Purgatorio~ and as part of the celebrations
of ^Paradiso~, but none is as non-formulaic as these two utterances.)

	|104.~  The word ^ventre~ (womb, belly), about as explicitly a
low-vernacular word as a Christian poet could employ in this exalted
context, brought forth a wonderfully numb-brained remark in complaint
by Raffaele Andreoli (comm. to vv. 103-105): "pi@u nobilmente il
Petrarca: 'Virginal chiostro'" (Petrarch says this more nobly:
"virginal cloister").  Obviously Andreoli could not have read Erich
Auerbach's essay ^"Sermo humilis"~ (in his ^Literary Language and Its
Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages~, tr. R. Manheim
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965 {1958}], pp. 25-66) -- if
it is not clear that he would have benefited from doing so;
nonetheless, his insistence on the desirability of a "higher," more
"civilized" stylistic level strikes a reader sympathetic to Dante's
strategy as inept.

	|107-108.~  If we needed clarification, here it is: Jesus has returned,
and Mary is about to return, to the Empyrean.  As far as we can tell,
all the other members of the Church Triumphant are meant to be
understood as still being present down here in the eighth heaven.

	|110.~  The "other lights" are clearly the members of the Church
Triumphant, not including Jesus and Mary.

	|112-120.~  Trucchi (comm. to these verses) considers this scene,
surmounting those that previously reflected the Annunciation and the
Coronation of the Virgin, a revisitation of her Assumption; as Carroll
already had suggested (comm. to vv. 91-108), this scene represents "the
heavenly counterpart of the Assumption of the body of Mary, which,
according to the belief of the Church, God did not suffer to see
corruption.  Like her Son, she rose from the dead on the third day, and
was received by Him and the angels into the joy of Paradise."

It would be like Dante to have worked those three major episodes in her
life into his scene, the first representing her being chosen, the
second her victory over death, and the third her bodily Assumption into
Heaven, a reward she shares with her Son alone.  The other
commentators, with the exception of Carroll (comm. to vv. 109-129), do
not mention it.

	|112-114.~  The poet refers to the Primo Mobile, the ninth sphere, also
known as the Crystalline Sphere (because, even though it is material,
it contains no other heavenly bodies in addition to itself).  It is
"royal" because it is the closest of the nine "volumes" (revolving
heavens, or spheres) to God.

	|115-120.~  Since his eyes could not yet see the Crystalline Sphere,
they of course could not follow Mary's rising still farther, that is,
beyond that sphere and back "home" into the Empyrean.

	|120.~  Mary sowed her seed, Jesus, in the world.

	|121-126.~  This final simile of the canto portrays the denizens of the
Empyrean, currently visiting Dante in the eighth heaven, as infants
reaching up with gratitude to their mommies who have just nursed them.
We remember that, in the non-invocation (vv. 55-60), Dante referred to
the Muses's milk that had nourished classical poets (verse 57), whose
songs would not be much help at all in singing Beatrice's smile.  That
milk is evidently in contrast with the one referred to here.  This
milk, we understand, is a nourishing vernacular, one quite different
from the Latin ^latte~ that is of little nutritional value for a
Christian poet.  (See Hollander ["Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in
^Studies in Dante~ {Ravenna: Longo, 1980}, pp. 115-29].)

The word "mamma" has an interesting presence in this poem (see the
notes to ^Inf~. XXXII.1-9 and to ^Purg~. XXI.97-99).  It is used a
total of five times, once in ^Inferno~, twice in ^Purgatorio~ (last in
^Purg~. XXX.44), and twice in this final canticle (first in ^Par~.
XIV.64).  Here it picks up on its last use in ^Purgatorio~.  It is
always a part of Dante's rather boisterous championing of the "low
vernacular," and never more naturally than in this warmly affectionate
scene that represents the members of the Church Triumphant stretching
upward in expression of their love for Mary.

Milan Kundera, exploring the manipulative nature of communist political
rhetoric in his novel ^The Joke~ (New York: HarperCollins, 1982
[definitive English version revised by the author]), p. 171, portrays a
bureaucrat making a speech that begins in sentimentality and progresses
to unvarnished political harangue.  Kundera characterizes the moment as
follows, as the politician, unabashedly exploiting the rhetorical vein
of the enthusiastic idealistic youths who had spoken before him, also
"spoke of spring, of flowers, of mamas and papas, he also spoke of
love, which according to him bore fruit, but suddenly his vocabulary
was transformed and the words duty, responsibility, the State, and
citizen appeared; suddenly there was no more papa and mama, but father
and mother...."  Dante would have loved it.

	|128.~  In the wake of Mary's ascent, following Jesus back up to the
Empyrean, the rest of the members of the Church Triumphant sing her
praise.  From the beginning of the commentary tradition, with Jacopo
della Lana (comm. to this verse), the hymn "Queen of Heaven" has been
identified as an antiphon sung at Easter, celebrating the resurrection
of Jesus.  (An antiphon is a responsive song, based on a Psalm, sung by
the congregation, after the reading of that Psalm, which forms the text
of the lesson at Matins or Vespers.  This particular antiphon was used
in the eight-day period defining the Easter season, Palm Sunday to
Easter itself.)  Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) gives the complete
Latin text, six verses, each ending with the cry of praise
"hallelujah."  (For the English text, see Singleton [comm. to this
verse].)  Both the third and sixth verses of the antiphon refer to the
resurrection of Jesus; since He has recently (verse 86) Himself gone
back up, we probably (and are meant to) think of His first ascent, in
the flesh then as now.  Porena (comm. to this verse) argues that we are
supposed to think that only the first line of the antiphon is sung,
because he does not believe that any reference to Christ's resurrection
is here intended, but only to Mary's worthiness to reascend to the
highest place in the universe.  Had that been the case, Dante probably
would have given us a clue, as he did in ^Purgatorio~ XXX.83-84, as to
where the text was interrupted.

	|130-135.~  In our translation, we have mainly followed Carroll (comm.
to vv. 130-139), who has Dante turning from his admiration of Mary to
"the heavenly treasures stored up in the Apostles.  The metaphors, it
must be confessed, are somewhat mixed.  The Apostles are at once the
sowers or the soil (depending on how we understand ^bobolce~), and the
chests in which the abundant harvest is stored.  The harvest is not
simply their own personal bliss, but the life and joy they have in the
treasure of redeemed souls all round them in this Heaven, won in
weeping in the Babylonian exile of earth, where for this wealth, they
abandoned gold."

	|130-132.~  Lino Pertile ("Le ^Egloghe~, Polifemo e il ^Paradiso~,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 71 [2006]: 285-302) demonstrates that many elements
found in this canto are reprocessed in Dante's first ^Eclogue~, and
goes on to hypothesize that this, the first modern European classical
eclogue, was written soon after Dante had finished working on this
canto, and that his reference, in the eclogue, to the ten "pails of
milk" that he hopes soon to send to Giovanni del Virgilio, his poetic
correspondent, are precisely the final ten cantos of the ^Paradiso~, a
bold and interesting idea first proposed by Carroll (comm. to ^Par~.
XXV.1-12).

	|132.~  The word ^bobolce~, a hapax, one, more than most, the
deployment of which is obviously forced by rhyme.  See Enrico Malato,
"bobolca," ^ED~ I (1970), for the various interpretations.  We believe
that it probably refers, as most of the early commentators believed, to
the apostles as "sowers" of the "seeds" of the new faith.

Lombardi (comm. to vv. 130-132) cites Venturi's wrathful response to
Dante's choice of vocabulary in this instance, a word "to locate in
some 'pouch' of ^Inferno~ rather than be included in so high a place in
^Paradiso~."

	|133-135.~  The first tercet of the concluding seven-line flourish
celebrates the victory of the triumphant Church, seen for the last time
in this realm.  There is no valediction for them, only celebration.

Pietro Alighieri (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 130-136) was apparently the
first (and remains one of the surprisingly few) to note the presence
here of an allusion to Psalm 136 [137]:1: "By the waters of Babylon,
there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion," a text Dante
himself had previously remembered in ^Epistola~ VII.30 (as was noted by
Poletto [comm. to vv. 130-135]).

It is worth noting here (it will be unmistakably clear in ^Paradiso~
XXXII) that Dante specifically refers to the Hebrews who were saved
("the treasure / they gained with tears of exile, / in Babylon").  It
will come as a shock to some readers to learn that fully half of those
in Paradise are, in fact, ancient Hebrews who believed in Christ as
their savior.  (See ^Par~. XXXII.22-24.)

	|133.~  For the importance (and changing significance) of the word
^tesoro~ (treasure), see the note to ^Par~. XVII.121.

Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 133-135) here puts into play both Matthew 6:20
(about laying up ^true~ treasure in Heaven) and 19:29 ("And everyone
who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or
children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and
will inherit eternal life").

	|136-139.~  Now the poet sets all his attention on St. Peter, who will
examine the protagonist on faith, the first of the three theological
virtues, in Canto XXIV, serving as guide in the first and the last of
the following four cantos.  In this heaven, he will share speaking
parts with two other of the original disciples, James and John, as well
as with the first father, Adam.  Peter will speak in both ^Paradiso~
XXIV (eight times for a total of 54 verses) and XXVII (an utterance in
36 verses and in two parts, both devoted to a ringing denunciation of
the corrupt papacy).
