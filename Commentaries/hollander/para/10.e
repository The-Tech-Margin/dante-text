	|1-6.~  Like the other tenth ^canti~, this one marks the crossing of a
borderline (in ^Inferno~ it separated the sins of Incontinence from the
walls of the City of Dis, enclosing the sins of the hardened will; in
^Purgatorio~, Ante-purgatory from Purgatory proper).  The first of
these is fairly indistinctly marked; the next is more formally
established.  But this one is as though a double line had been drawn
across the space separating Canto IX from Canto X, separating the
planets attained by the earth's shadow from those, beginning with the
Sun, that are free of such darkening.  None of the souls we will meet
from now on suffered from the human weakness that we found among those
who lacked a vigorous faith, or those who placed too much hope in the
things of this world, or those who failed to understand the nature of
true love (for the program of the defective Theological Virtues in the
first three heavens of ^Paradiso~, see the note to ^Par~. III.47-48;
and see Andreoli [comm. to ^Par~. III.16]: "The fact is that it is only
in the fourth heaven that we shall begin to find souls who are
completely beyond reproach").

On this opening, see Fiorenzo Forti ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso,"~ dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier,
1968]), p. 352: After the several references in the last canto to human
strife, Dante now turns to "celestial harmony instead of earthly
disorder."  Forti later says (p. 380) that the celestial Athens (see
^Conv~. III.xiv.15) is the point at which we have now arrived.  For the
mistaken notion that these opening lines constitute an "invocation,"
see Gary Cestaro ("^Paradiso~ X," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 148): " ...this opening contemplation of the
Trinity, and of ^spiratio~ in particular, amounts to no less than a new
^invocatio~."

These six verses might be paraphrased: "God the Father (the Power),
gazing on His Son (Wisdom) with the Holy Spirit (Love) that breathes
forth eternally from both Father and Son, created all things that
revolve above, whether in angelic consciousness or in the sphere that
they govern (e.g., that ruled by the Principalities, Venus), with the
result that anyone who (as Dante now is doing) contemplates the
Father's Power cannot fail to savor it."

Angela Meekins ("Reflecting on the Divine: Notes on Dante's Heaven of
the Sun," ^The Italianist~ 18 [1998]: 28-70) has written a study of the
heaven of the Sun that deals in an orderly way with the main subjects
of these four and a half cantos: the Trinity; the theologies of Thomas
and of Bonaventure; the order and imagery of this heaven; its mirror
motif; its unity and difference as they variously apply to the souls
whom we meet in the Sun; its mysticism and poetry; and, finally, its
representation of the mind's road to God.

Eileen Sweeney ("Aquinas' Three Levels of Divine Predication in Dante's
^Paradiso~," ^Comitatus~ 16 [1985]: 29-45) argues that, beginning in
the heaven of the Sun, Dante has programmatic recourse to Aquinas's
three levels of human predication of the qualities of God,
^affirmative~ (e.g., one may say that God is wise), ^negative~ (God is
wise, but not as humans are wise), ^supereminent~ (God is wise, but His
wisdom cannot be expressed in human language).

	|1-3.~  Dante seizes the opportunity to underline his adherence to
orthodox doctrine: the Holy Spirit breathes forth from both the Father
and the Son.  See Carroll (comm. to vv.1-6).

	|4-5.~  These lines have caused difficulty.  Where some have thought
the references are to thoughts of things and things themselves in the
created universe, most contemporary readers (perhaps following Fiorenzo
Forti ["Canto X,"  in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera: "Paradiso,"~ dir. M.
Marcazzan {Florence: Le Monnier, 1968}], p. 353) think the references
are to angelic Intelligences (the nine orders of angels) and to the
things impelled by them (the heavens with their planets).

	|6.~  This verse initiates the theme of ingestion in the canto, a part
of the metaphor of eating first deployed as a governing trope by Dante
in ^Convivio~.  It has a perhaps surprising presence in this canto
that, in light of its higher interests, might seem an inappropriate
place for such concerns.  See also vv. 23 ("tasted"), 25 ("feed
yourself"), 88 ("thirst" for "wine"), 96 ("where sheep are fattened").

	|7-15.~  This is the third address to the reader in ^Paradiso~ (see
also ^Par~. II.10-18 and V.109-114) and is in fact triple, with
three imperatives, each in the first line of a tercet, marking its
triune shape, which breaks a single action into three moments, matching
the opening Trinitarian proem of the canto (vv. 1-6), with the reader
being asked first to elevate his or her sight (verse 7), then to begin
to gaze (verse 10), and finally to perceive (13).
[Note revised 24 August 2013; see the revised note to ^Par.~ IX.10-12.]

	|9.~  "The heavenly bodies have two opposing movements: the one, daily
(or equatorial), from east to west in the plane of the Equator, the
other, annual (or zodiacal), from west to east in the plane of the
ecliptic" (Bosco/Reggio, comm. to vv. 8-9).  Dante is referring to the
point where the Sun in the plane of ecliptic, which is tilted so as to
intersect the equatorial plane at an angle of 23.5 degrees (see ^Conv~.
III.v.14), crosses the Equator at the spring and fall equinox.  In the
spring, the Sun is in Aries, as we have seen (e.g., in ^Inf~. I.37-40).
 On March 21 and September 21 there are twelve hours of daylight and
twelve hours of darkness everywhere on the globe.  Unfortunately for
Dante, reality did not collaborate with his ideal star chart, on which
the spring equinox would have occurred on March 25, thus on the very
day his descent into Hell began; however, he does manage to refer to it
in such a way as to allow the reader to think of it as at least roughly
contemporaneous with the beginning of the journey.  For Dante's
previous exposition of this equinoctial matter, see ^Convivio~ III.v.13.

	|10-12.~  God, apparently an aesthetician, loves contemplating His own
work, just as the reader is encouraged to do as well.  Barely out of
sight in this tercet is Dante the maker, contemplating his own
God-bearing poem with wonder and delight.

	|16-21.~  See Tozer (comm. to vv. 16-18) for the following paraphrase
and explanation: "'and if their path (the zodiac) were not inflected
(i.e., oblique), much influence in Heaven would be fruitless, and
almost every agency on earth below would fail.'  It is the obliquity of
the zodiac which causes the changes of the seasons; without it the sun
could not produce the effect for which it was designed, and such
agencies as those which originate life and growth in plants and
animals, movement in winds and streams, changes of temperature, and the
like, would no longer exist."  And see Carroll (comm. to vv. 7-27).

	|22-27.~  There is some dispute as to whether this is a distinct
address to the reader or a continuation of that found in vv. 7-15.
However, even Scartazzini, who undercounts the occurrences of the
phenomenon in the poem (see the note to ^Par~. XXII.106-111), believes
this represents a second, separate address.  Because they are rhetorically
separate entities ("Leva dunque, lettore, ..." and "Or ti riman, lettor,
...") and enjoy temporal separation (the reader is asked three times to
look along with Dante up at the circling heavens, and then to think upon
what he or she has seen, unaided by the poet, who now must return to his
narrative), one does not find an easy objection to consider them as being
in fact more than one, the first of which is indeed tripartite ("Leva,"
"comincia," and "Vedi" [vv. 7, 10, and 13]) and the second single.
Perhaps because the other eightteen addresses to the reader (see the
note to ^Inf~. VIII.94-96) are all single, this double one has caused
some to consider it, too, single; that is probably not reason enough.
It may be difficult to believe that Dante would have designed the poem
with seven addresses to the reader in each of the first two ^cantiche~
and only six in the third.  This reader's inability to do exactly that
was the cause of his miscounting of the addresses to the reader in the
first version of these notes. [This part of this note revised 24 August 2013; see the
revised note to ^Par.~ IX.10-12.]

See Gabriele Muresu ("Le 'corone' della vera sapienza [^Paradiso~ X],"
in his ^Tra gli adepti di Sodoma. Saggi di semantica dantesca [terza
serie]~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002], pp. 282-84) and Luca Curti ("Canto X,"
in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 147-48), for the
closeness of the images of the "feast of knowledge" found here and in
^Convivio~ (III.v.20-22).  Some thirty-seven years ago, in 1968, when
he was a graduate student at Princeton, Prof. Robin McCallister made
the suggestion that perhaps we should look upon the ^Paradiso~ as in
fact the completion of the abandoned ^Convivio~, now properly
corrected.  The controlling element in this central metaphor of these
two ^terzine~ moves from a scholar's bench (verse 22), on which we
readers sit, listening to Dante's lecture, to (in verse 25) a seat at a
banquet, at which chef Dante is preparing the meal, a "feast of
knowledge" indeed.  He does, however, beg off from serving us, leaving
us to do that for ourselves, since he must attend to continuing his
narrative.

	|23.~  For the interesting verb, ^prelibare~, appearing here for the
first time in the poem, see the note to ^Paradiso~ XIV.4.

	|27.~  A ^hapax~, the Latinism ^scriba~, rhyming with two other
Latinisms, ^preliba~ (tasted [and not yet swallowed]) and ^ti ciba~
(feed yourself), is one of the key words in Dante's self-presentation
as veracious author, which occupies a privileged space here, the last
line of one of the longest introductory passages to a canto in this
poem at the point where it has reached the first stage of its
destination, what we might refer to as "God's country."  Poletto (comm.
to vv. 25-27) points to the apt phrase in ^Monarchia~ II.x.6, where
Luke is referred to as the scribe of Christ (... "Cristus, ut scriba
eius Lucas testatur"); see also Torraca (comm. to vv. 22-27),
indicating the same passage.  And see Gian Roberto Sarolli, "Dante
^scriba Dei~" (in his ^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1971], pp. 189-336, and the note to ^Paradiso~ V.85.  For a
meditation on this verse as encapsulating Dante's self-presentation as
scribe throughout the poem, see Angelo Jacomuzzi ("'Ond'io son fatto
scriba,'" in his ^L'imago al cerchio.  Invenzione e visione nella
"Divina Commedia"~ [Milan: Silva, 1968], pp. 29-100).  And see Minnis
(^Medieval Theory of Authorsip: Scholastic Literary Attitudes in the
Later Middle Ages~ [London: Scolar, 1984]), p. 94, citing St.
Bonaventure (near the end of his prologue to the ^Books of Sentences~
of Peter Lombard).  Considering the latter's role in that undertaking,
Bonaventure says this: "The method of making a book is fourfold.  For
someone writes the materials of others, adding or changing nothing, and
this person is said to be merely the |scribe~.  Someone else writes the
materials of others, adding, but nothing of his own, and this person is
said to be the |compiler~.  Someone else writes both the materials of
other men, and of his own, but the materials of others as the principal
materials, and his own annexed for the purpose of clarifying them, and
this person is said to be the |commentator~, not the author.  Someone
else writes both his own materials and those of others, but his own as
the principal materials, and the materials of others annexed for the
purpose of confirming his own, and such must be called the |author~."
Dante's claim here, to be merely the "scribe" of God, in Bonaventure's
scheme the least of writers, is at once part of the topos of modesty
and a shattering denial of it, since Dante's "mere scribal" activity
lifts him to the level of the authors of Scripture, including the
Solomon whom we will see in this very canto.

	|28-39.~  The ascent to the Sun, we are perhaps surprised to discover,
has not until now been accomplished.  We must surmise that the view of
the heavens purveyed in vv. 1-27 derives from what Dante saw looking up
from the planet Venus.  His movement up from there, as is Beatrice's
guidance while leading him up, seems instantaneous, seems not to occur
in time.  Cf. the earlier insistence on the sense of the ascent to a
higher sphere without awareness of time in ^Paradiso~ I.91-93; V.91-93;
and VIII.13.

	|28-30.~  The Sun is seen as redirecting God's beneficial gifts (e.g.,
the warmth that causes vegetative growth) down to earth, as well as,
while everlasting itself, giving us, who live here, our main means of
telling time.

	|31.~  This "point," to which the poet has referred (in verse 9), is in
the constellation Aries.

	|32-33.~  For this motion, see Dante's description of the diurnal
movement of the Sun in ^Convivio~ III.v.14, "rising upward like the
screw of a [n olive] press" (tr. R. Lansing).  The spring ushers in the
lengthening sunlight of early summer (21 March to 21 June), which
begins to subside only after the summer solstice.

	|35-36.~  Grandgent (comm. to vv. 35-36) cites A. Fazzi (^GSLI~, vol.
73, p. 112), making the distinction between an uncaused, spontaneous
thought, which is what Dante is describing here, and the sort of
thought he had referred to earlier (^Inf~. XXIII.10-11): "Just as one
thought issues from another, / so, from the first, another now was
born."

	|37-39.~  Beatrice is described in terms that recall ^Convivio~
I.ii.14, describing the life of St. Augustine: "... the progress of his
life, which proceeded from bad to good, good to better, and better to
best" (tr. R. Lansing).

	|40-42.~  Vincenzo Placella ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1987}], p.
222) follows Petrocchi in thinking that this effulgence is not that
emanating from Beatrice (as most early commentators believed, perhaps
encouraged by her presence in the preceding ^terzina~), but of the
souls in the Sun, who are so bright that they outshine even that
brightest of all celestial bodies.  For a fairly early instance (ca.
1791) of the current majority sense of this tercet, see Lombardi (comm.
to vv. 40-45), citing the prophet Daniel, whose final vision (Daniel
12:3) portrays the wise as shining with the brightness of the sun.
Rebecca Beal ("Beatrice in the Sun: A Vision from Apocalypse," ^Dante
Studies~ 103 [1985]: 63), as part of her project to read Beatrice
surrounded by the twelve souls (who also surround Dante, we should
remember) as the "woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her
feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" of Apocalypse 12:1,
i.e., as Ecclesia, the Church.  However, the next verse (Apoc. 12:2)
tells us that this woman is pregnant, which hardly works out in Beal's
equation, and so, like the moon beneath her feet, is allowed the silent
treatment.  Returning to this biblical text and its relationship to the
heaven of the Sun, Beal ("Bonaventure, Dante, and the Apocalyptic Woman
Clothed with the Sun," ^Dante Studies~ 114 [1996]: 211), now intent on
demonstrating Bonaventure's conspicuous interest in "the woman clothed
with the sun" in his sermons, notes that while, in two of them, he does
indeed refer to her as Ecclesia, he far more often considers her as a
representation of Mary (as her pregnant condition invites the reader to
surmise).  And thus Beal argues that her valence changes once we leave
the tenth canto behind.

	|43-48.  The brightness that Dante saw in these souls, which made them
stand out from the Sun,~ not by being a different color, but by being
even brighter than the brightest thing known to our mortal vision,
simply cannot be described by the poet, outdone by God's art, as it
were.  For discussion of this contrast in these lines between Dante's
limited ability as artist in comparison to God's, see Teodolinda
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1992], pp. 196-97).

	|49-51.~  Dante refers to those who show themselves in the Sun, the
fourth of the planets, as the "fourth family"; God makes them happy by
demonstrating his other two Trinitarian aspects, Wisdom (manifest in
the Son) and Love (present in the Holy Spirit).  See the opening of
this canto, vv. 1-3.

If the preceding six verses described Dante's inability to portray the
brightness of God's creatures, this tercet proclaims God's "art" in
demonstrating His triune nature.

	|52-54.~  Beatrice plays with one of the most present medieval
metaphors, the Sun as representing God (see ^Conv~. III.xii.7), the
"sun" of the angels, his "planets" in the Empyrean, who has raised
Dante to the height of this heaven, home of the physical sun.

	|59-60.~  Discussing these lines, Luca Curti ("Canto X," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 150-52), paraphrases them as
follows: "... my mind, so concentrated on God that Beatrice was
eclipsed and forgotten, divided His splendor into many things, so that
I saw many splendors sparkling" (p. 151).  As opposed to his
"forgetting" of Beatrice while he was still on earth, looked back upon
with horror in ^Purgatorio~ XXX and XXXI, this forgetful behavior is
laudable, as, in the next tercet, Beatrice's own reaction indicates.

	|61-63.~  Beatrice's delighted smile at being forgotten in favor of God
brings Dante's attention back to her and, surely we are meant to
understand, to the souls in the Sun.  Albert Rossi, while a graduate
student at Princeton some twenty-five years ago, suggested that the
phrase "li occhi suoi ridenti" (verse 62) reflected a passage in
^Convivio~ (III.xv.2): "The text [of the canzone ^Amor che ne la mente
mi ragiona~] says then that 'in her face there appear things which
manifest some part of the joy of Paradise,' and it identifies the place
where it appears, namely her eyes and her smile [st. iv, vv. 1-3].
Here it is necessary to know that the eyes of wisdom are her
demonstrations, by which truth is seen with the greatest certainty, and
her smiles are her persuasions, in which the inner light of wisdom is
revealed behind a kind of veil; and in each of them is felt the highest
joy of blessedness, which is the greatest good of Paradise" [tr. R.
Lansing].

	|64-69.~  The souls in the Sun make Beatrice and Dante the center of
their circle ("crown") just as the halo around the Moon (dwelling of
the former huntress, Diana) is formed by the vapor in our atmosphere
that attaches "cloth" to the "belt" of Latona's daughter.

	|70-75.~  In the Empyrean (^la corte del cielo~), whence Dante has
returned, there are jewels (the saints and/or the angels?) so precious
that they may not be removed from the kingdom (resolved from metaphor,
be described here on earth), and it was of them that these souls in the
Sun sang.  In this canto we are given less indication than in any we
have read (in which the souls are making musical tribute) about what
exactly the souls were singing; eventually we learn that the conjoined
choruses of the two groups of twelve theologians are singing of the
Incarnation (^Par~. XIII.27) and of the Trinity (^Par~. XIII.26;
XIV.28-31), as Carroll has pointed out (comm. to vv. 70-93).  One who
does not put wings on himself (Icarus-like?), as Dante has, to fly up
to see these "jewels" might as well await word about them from the
dumb.  One has to see for oneself, apparently (since not even Dante is
telling), that is, take the trip through the heavens that, as far as we
learn, only Paul and Dante were privileged to enjoy while still in this
life.

A question remains unanswered in the commentaries.  Are the singing
souls, clearly presented as being situated in the Sun, distinguished
from the "jewels," about whom they are singing and who are in the
Empyrean, or are they counted among their companions here in the Sun?
While many commentators cite ^Inferno~ II.125 for the phrase ^corte del
cielo~, no one seems to be bothered by the fact that it there clearly
refers to the Empyrean, specifically referring to Mary, Lucy, Rachel,
and Beatrice.  It seems necessary to understand that the twelve
theologians are singing of exalted "colleagues" whom they have
temporarily left behind them in the Empyrean, for instance, the Virgin
Mary, possibly St. Francis himself, and other "stars" of the afterlife,
too precious to be sent below for Dante's instruction or to be
identified by their descending colleagues in beatitude.  The passage
often makes little sense if it is read as referring to anything but the
Empyrean: e.g., verse 70: the present tense of Dante's returning to
earth would seem to put that as happening ^after~ the final vision in
the Empyrean, i.e., ^now~ in the writer's personal history; verses
71-72: the present tenses of the verbs describing the state of the
"jewels" contrast with the past tenses used to describe the actions of
the souls of the wise men in the Sun; verse 73: "these" ^(quei lumi)~
souls in the Sun are distinguished from "those" ^(quelle gioe)~ of whom
they sing.

To explain the mercantile reference in this passage Torraca (comm. to
vv. 70-73) refers to Marco Polo's ^Il milione~ (XXV, LXXIX), where the
traveler reports that the Great Khan would not allow rubies (see ^Par~.
IX.69 and note), in the first case, or pearls, in the second, to leave
his kingdom in order to protect their value, not letting them become
common by allowing their export.  For Portirelli's views on Dante's
knowledge of Marco Polo's voyage, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ I.22-24.

	|76-81.~  After the "suns" in the Sun had circled Dante and Beatrice
three times, like the stars that circle the poles, they seemed to Dante
to resemble ladies in the dance who pause, awaiting the resumption of
singing in order to continue with their dance steps.  See the
description of the practice of ladies who danced to the singing of
^ballate~ in Dante's time in Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 79).

For a meditation on this canto that takes its departure from these
lines, see John Freccero, "The Dance of the Stars" (1968), in ^Dante:
The Poetics of Conversion~ (Cambridge: Harvard, 1986?), pp. 221-44.

	|78.~  For a different version of this image, see ^Purgatorio~
VIII.86-87, where Dante's eyes move toward the heavens, "to that zone
where the stars move slowest, / as does the spoke of a wheel close to
the axle."

	|82-99.~  Thomas's first word, "Quando," is matched only by one other
speaker's first word similarly occupying the last place in its line,
that uttered by Ulysses (^Inf~. XXVI.90).  Where Ulysses has epic
pretensions in his self-narrative (see the note to ^Inf~. XXVI.90-93),
Thomas, another kind of "hero," one who indeed vigorously pursued
virtue and knowledge (and not merely in what we might regard as an
advertisement for himself) is a foil to prideful Ulysses.  The Greek
adventurer's pride is matched by Thomas's humility (his name occurs
only after he finishes the eighteen-line introductory portion of his
speech and then only after he has named his teacher.  Can anyone
imagine Ulysses referring to someone who had been his teacher?).
Beatrice does begin one of her speeches with "Quando" at the end of a
line (^Purg~. XXXI.67), but this is hardly her first speech in the poem
nor even the beginning of a new speech; indeed, it is part of her long
accusation of Dante for his backsliding after her death.  Thomas's
first self-description (vv. 94-96) intrinsically suggests that he is
dramatically different from Ulysses, who in his pursuit of knowledge
had companions whom he treated as the mere instruments of his own
adventure and whom he destroyed along with himself; Thomas, on the
other hand, "... was a lamb among the holy flock / led by Dominic along
the road / where sheep are fattened if they do not stray."  That last
word ^(vaneggia)~ surely has a kinship with Ulysses, whose wandering
brings him under the spell of the Siren (at least according to Dante:
see ^Purg~. XIX.19-24).  What Ulysses did, Thomas chose not to do.

	|86-96.~  It is interesting that this portion of the first utterance of
St. Thomas, the great opponent of poetry for its seductive figurative
quality, beautiful but simply untrue, contains several metaphors: the
"stair" (the ascent of the heavens toward God) that Dante is on; the
"wine" (knowledge) that Thomas will share with Dante; the "plants"
(souls) that surround Beatrice and him; the "lambs" (friars) who were
Thomas and his fellow Dominicans on earth; the "path" (the way to God)
that led to his salvation; the "fattening" (knowledge of God's truth)
found in the nourishment of the Word.  One can only imagine Thomas's
objection had he been able to read those words, put by Dante into his
mouth.  The last metaphor will have its second moment in the next canto
(^Par~. XI.25), and then its last and triumphant appearance in the
final verse of that canto (^Par~. XI.139).

	|87.~  The "stair" that is climbed only twice is the pathway to Heaven
negotiated by a living soul in grace, who is thus promised a return
trip (we again think of St. Paul, Dante's only known precursor, though
unreported miraculous journeys are not ruled out).  Grandgent (comm. to
^Par~. X.87) notes that this is a clear prediction of Dante's ultimate
salvation, and refers the reader to a similar earlier gesture in
^Purgatorio~ II.91-92 (and see, of course, ^Purg~. XXXII.100-102).

	|92-93.~  It is perhaps significant that where the narrator had
previously informed us (verse 65) that he and the other souls in the
Sun made a center of Beatrice and Dante, Thomas now refers only to
Beatrice as being at the center of their circle.

	|97-99.~  Thomas begins his "catologue of saints," twelve in number
perhaps to remind us of the original apostles, with Albertus Magnus
(1193-1280), often referred to as "Doctor Universalis" because of his
extensive learning; he taught at Cologne, where Aquinas was one of his
pupils.  In some quarters it has become fashionable, after the
exertions of Bruno Nardi, to argue for the actual preeminence in
Dante's thought of Albert over Thomas.  But see Marc Cogan (^The Design
in the Wax: The Structure of the "Divine Comedy" and Its Meaning~
[Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1999], pp. xxiii-xxiv):
"Despite Nardi's efforts to convince us that Albert the Great was
Dante's preferred philosophical source, it is Aquinas whom Dante
chooses as the principal spokesman for theology in the ^Paradiso~, not
Albert or any other theologian."  For more detailed arguments that are
in basic agreement with this position, see Paul Arvisu Dumol (^The
Metaphysics of Reading Underlying Dante's "Commedia": The "Ingegno"~
[New York: Peter Lang, 1998], esp. pp. 139-66).

See Paget Toynbee, "Some obligations of Dante to Albertus Magnus," in
(^Dante Studies and Researches~ [Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press,
1971], pp. 38-55), identifying eight passages in Albert's work that
find their way into Dante's writings.  The vast majority of these (six)
are found in ^Convivio~; only one is located in the ^Commedia~.

	|99.~  Thomas Aquinas (1225-74), often referred to as "Doctor
Angelicus," was, in the minds of many, the greatest theologian of his
time.  It is perhaps fair to say that the position of those of Dante's
readers most interested in the question has swung from the strict
Thomistic construction of Dante sponsored by Giovanni Busnelli to the
far more concessive views (which perhaps yield too much of Dante's
allegiance to Thomism) of Mario Casella ("Nel cielo del Sole: l'anima e
la mente di san Tommaso," ^Studi Danteschi~ 29 [1950]: 5-40; 30 [1951]:
5-22; 31 [1952]: 5-30) and of two of the leading non-Italian students
of the poet's theology, $Etienne Gilson and Kenelm Foster.  For an
extensive treatment of Dante's intellectual response to Aquinas, see
Gilson's classic study (^Dante and Philosophy~, tr. D. Moore [New York:
Harper and Row, 1963 {1939}]); and see Foster's entry "Tommaso
d'Aquino," (^ED~ V [1976]), pp. 626-49, as well as his much briefer
English essay (in ^The Two Dantes and Other Studies~ [Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1977], pp. 56-65).  Dante criticism is
currently a good deal more "ecumenical," a position that undergirds
Amilcare Iannucci's fine brief treatment of this subject, "Theology,"
in Lansing (^Dante Encyclopedia~ [New York: Garland, 2000], pp.
811-15).  It would not be going too far to say that Dante is a
precursor of at least one aspect of Renaissance humanism, its pleasure
in syncretism, a delight in putting together things that would prefer
to be kept separate, making new concepts out of the ideas of the
unsuspecting (and defenseless) great figures of the past, about some of
which they would, had they a voice, surely bellow in complaint.  For a
similar view (and it is rare to come across the word "syncretism" used
with favorable connotation for Dante's mode of thinking), see Zygmunt
Baranski ("Canto XXII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002]), p.
361 (and see the note to ^Par~. XXXII.34-36).  For a cautionary note,
indicating the complexity of the entire question of Dante's various
philosophic allegiances, see Simon Gilson ("Medieval Science in Dante's
^Commedia~: Past Approaches and Future Directions," ^Reading Medieval
Studies~ 27 [2001]: 39-77, ^passim~).

The fact that Thomas was not canonized until two years after Dante's
death does not in itself mean anything, although some argue that for
Dante he consequently lacked the authority that sainthood confers.  For
him, as later for Boccaccio, the Church's judgments were far indeed
from authoritative.  For instance, the canonization of Pope Celestine V
in 1313 left no mark in the poem; indeed, whether or not one thinks it
is he who is referred to in ^Inferno~ III (see the note to ^Inf~.
III.58-60), the clear negative reference in ^Inferno~ XXVII.105 was not
edited out after 1313, nor was it countered by some glowing reference
in ^Paradiso~, where it would have easily fit (e.g., in the sphere of
Saturn, temporary home of the great contemplatives, including Benedict
and Peter Damian).  Indeed, while Dante may honor Thomas more than any
other theologian, that does not mean that he always agrees with him -
far from it.

	|103-105.~  Gratian, the twelfth-century collector and organizer of
canon law, who in his ^Decretum~, according to some of Dante's
commentators, tried to harmonize secular and ecclesiastical law, the
two courts referred to in verse 104; others believe Dante is referring
to two functions of the Church, the sacramental and judgmental.

After the slam Dante has put in Folco's mouth against decretals (^Par~.
IX.133-135), it seems strange to some that Gratian is so well rewarded.
 See Fiorenzo Forti ("Canto X,"  in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso,"~ dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], pp.
371-73) for the history of the dispute among the commentators caused by
Dante's inclusion of Gratian here.  And see Aldo Adversi ("Dante e il
canonista Graziano [^Par~. X, 103-105]," ^Il Diritto ecclesiastico~ 106
[1995]: 499-513).

	|106-108.~  An almost exact contemporary of Gratian was Peter Lombard,
the "Master of the Sentences" (his major work was the compendium
^Sententiarum Libri~, presenting an elaborate overview of dogmatic
theology).  He says, in his preface to that work, that, like the poor
widow in Luke's Gospel (21:1-4), he hopes to make his small
contribution to God's treasury.

	|109-114.~  Solomon, son of David and king of Israel, the question of
whose salvation was much discussed during the Middle Ages (see the
reference to the world's hunger for news of him in vv. 110-111, along
with its prime reasons for doubting that he was saved, his prodigious
carnal affections in his old age and his falling into idolatry as part
of these ^amours~ [I Kings 11:1-9]; these missteps were compounded, for
some, by his authorship of the Canticle of Canticles).  However, if the
Truth be true (i.e., if we are to believe what we read in the Bible),
God specifically (I Kings 3:12) singles Solomon out for the highest
praise: "I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there
was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like
you ^(nec post te surrecturus sit)~," this last the source of Dante's
"non surse il secondo" (verse 114).  This passage is probably
remembered in Matthew 11:11, "Among them that are born of women there
has not risen a greater than John the Baptist," cited by Tommaseo
(comm. to ^Par~. X.112-114).

Michele Scherillo ("Perch$e Dante salva Salomone," in his ^Alcuni
capitoli della biografia di Dante~ [Turin: Loescher, 1896], pp.
299-311) reviews Solomon's many "disqualifications" from being
considered an author of Scripture and then his checkered career among
the exegetes, the most authoritative of whom, from Dante's own point of
view (e.g., St. Augustine, Brunetto Latini), deny him salvation (if St.
Jerome granted it).  (For three twelfth-century theologians who differ
[Philip of Harvengt, Peter Comestor, and Joachim of Flora], saying that
Solomon was indeed saved, see Sarolli [^Prolegomena alla "Divina
Commedia"~ {Florence: Olschki, 1971}], pp. 210-15).  Scherillo suggests
that it was primarily his kingship that inspired Dante to consider him
among the blessed, but does not overlook the force of the fact that
Solomon was indeed, in Dante's eyes (and, of course, not in his alone)
the author of canonical texts: Proverbs (see, e.g., ^Conv~. III.xi.12;
^Mon~. III.i.3), Ecclesiastes (see, e.g., ^Conv~. II.x.10), the
Canticle of Canticles (see, e.g., ^Conv~. II.v.5); though he never
refers to Solomon's authorship of the Book of Wisdom, he cites its
first line in ^Paradiso~ XVIII.91-93.  In other words, for Dante,
Solomon is ^scriba Dei~ (a scribe of God).  No matter how anyone might
call into question his credentials, he has them.  We may reflect that
Dante shares both a "monarchical" and a "theological" identity with
Solomon, poet of empire and of God, his new "Book of Wisdom" (replacing
the previous and abandoned attempt, the ^Banquet~) railing against the
enemies of the true and God-centered empire.  The more one thinks of
Dante's Solomon, the more he becomes a likely choice as precursor of
this poet (perhaps even in the light of his sexual trespass, something
that he, his father (David), and Dante Alighieri, by his own confession
[^Purg~. XXX and XXXI], have in common).  They also share, as Dante
might well have considered, authorship of works that seemingly
celebrated carnal affection only, upon deeper consideration, to express
love of a higher kind.

On Solomon's ^auctoritas~ see A.J. Minnis (^Medieval Theory of
Authorsip: Scholastic Literary Attitudes in the Later Middle Ages~
[London: Scolar, 1984]), pp. 94-96; 110-12.  For the view of Solomon of
early Christian exegetes, see Mishtooni Bose ("From Exegesis to
Appropriation: The Medieval Solomon," ^Medium Aevum~ 65 [1996]:
187-210).  On the sense of the overwhelming importance, for Dante's
view of Solomon, of his authorship of the Book of Wisdom, see Jaroslav
Pelikan (^What Has Athens to Do with Jerusalem? Timaeus and Genesis in
Counterpoint~ [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1997], p. 3):
Wisdom "was the book that brought together the ^Timaeus~ and Genesis on
the beginning of the world" (cited by Herzmann ["From Francis to
Solomon: Eschatology in the Sun," in ^Dante for the New Millennium~,
ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey {New York: Fordham
University Press, 2003}], p. 330).  For a study of Dante's sense of
identity with Solomon, see Lauren Seem ("^Nolite iudicare~: Dante and
the Dilemma of Judgment," in ^Writers Reading Writers: Intertextual
Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Literature in Honor of Robert
Hollander~, ed. Janet Levarie Smarr [Newark: University of Delaware
Press, 2007], pp. 73-88).  Peter Dronke ("'Orizzonte che rischiari,'"
in his ^Dante and Medieval Latin Traditions~ [Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1986 {1975}], p. 96) discusses Thomas's presence as
one of three authors of commentaries to the Canticle of Canticles found
here in the heaven of the Sun.  One wants to keep in mind that the
Canticle, which more than most canonical biblical texts requires
elucidation to save it from its carnal self, was, along with the
Psalms, among the most heavily commented books of the Bible in the
Middle Ages.

	|110.~  Mario Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~],
^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 43,
points out that this is the third appearance in this canto of a form of
the verb ^spirare~ (so closely and often associated with the
"spiration" of the Holy Spirit), the only one to contain so many
occurrences (see also vv. 2 and 51).  He also observes that this word
is part of this canto's program (1) to honor the activity of the Spirit
in special ways; (2) to abrogate humans' pride in their wisdom, which
is of divine origin (see Exod. 31:3); (3) to remind us that wisdom is
the highest of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2).

	|115-117.~  Dionysius the Areopagite, converted by St. Paul at Athens
(as mentioned by Luke in Acts 17:34) and martyred there in A.D. 95.  He
was erroneously assumed to be the author of the ^De caelesti
hierarchia~, a work particularly prized for its description of the
orders of the angels and of their nature.  (Dante makes wide use of it
in the ^Paradiso~.)  The ^Celestial Hierarchy~ and three others of the
reputed works of Dionysius were actually produced some five centuries
later by Greek neo-platonists and were translated into Latin only in
the ninth century.

	|118-120.~  Orosius, whose historical compendium, entitled ^Historiae
adversus paganos~, was written at the suggestion of St. Augustine as a
defense of the Christian religion's beneficial role in human history.
Augustine made use of it in writing his ^De civitate Dei~, and it is
frequently used by Dante.  See Toynbee (^Dante Studies and Researches~
[Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1971 {1902}], "Dante's
obligations to the ^Ormista~," pp. 121-36) for the opinion that the
reference is indeed to Orosius, which for a long time has been the view
of the majority of the commentators.  However, Alberto Pincherle,
"Agostino," ^ED~ I (1970), p. 82b, mentions the usual suspects
(Orosius, Ambrose, Tertullian, Paulinus of Nola, and Lactantius), and
settles on Marius Victorinus.  For continued insistence that the
^avvocato de' tempi cristiani~ is in fact Orosius, see Giorgio Brugnoli
("I tempi cristiani di Dante," ^Critica del testo~ 1 [1998]: 491-92).
The early commentators were divided, with the majority favoring St.
Ambrose, but others backing Orosius.  After them, the majority opinion
has settled on Orosius by a wide margin, with many convinced by
Venturi's argument (comm. to this tercet) that Dante would never have
spoken of the great St. Ambrose as a "piccioletta luce" (little light).
 Moore should still be consulted (^Contributions to the Textual
Criticism of the "Divina Commedia"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1889], pp. 457-60) for three strong arguments for the
reference's being to Orosius and not to Ambrose.  But see Otfried
Lieberknecht ("'L'avvocato de' tempi cristiani,' ^Par.~ 10.118-120:
Ambrose of Milan Reconsidered," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante
Society of America~ [September 1996]) for a thoughtful attempt to
resuscitate Ambrose's candidacy, even if the author ends by admitting
that Orosius remains the front-runner.

	|121-129.~  In the first of these three tercets, as a unique instance
among this bevy of ^illuminati~, Dante calls attention to the
importance of a particular soul, a signal honor done Boethius, the
author of the ^De consolatione Philosophiae~.  Dante mentions him,
always with this particular text in mind, some dozen times in
^Convivio~ (first in I.ii.13).  He was active in the first half of the
sixth century, holding the consulship at Rome, but earned the
displeasure of the emperor, Theodoric, who imprisoned him at Pavia and
finally had him put to death by torture.  See the note to verse 128.

There is a possibility that Dante was aware of the problematic nature
of Boethius's Christian faith.  He was a convert, and subsequently
wrote Christian apologetic works; but defenders of his orthodoxy are
hard put to explain the total absence of overt Christian reference in
the ^Consolatio~.  A good deal of effort has gone into that enterprise,
but one has the nagging feeling that Nicholas Trivet was perhaps
justified in claiming that Boethius, in this last stage, was not a
Christian, but a neo-platonist.  For a review of the entire issue, see
Pierre Courcelle (^La Consolation de Philosophie dans la tradition
litt$eraire~ [Paris: $Etudes Augustiniennes, 1967]).  For discussion of
Dante's possible sense that the ^Consolatio~ was not all it should have
been, see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and Dante's
^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]: 353-55, 361-62).  For a more recent
attempt to deal with the question, see Giuseppina Mezzadroli ("Dante,
Boezio e le sirene," ^Lingua e stile~ 25 [1990]: 49-50).

See Trucchi (comm. to vv. 1-6) for the notion that, where Aquinas (^ST~
Supp., q. 69, a. 2) says that only some will have to spend time in
Purgatory before they pass on to Heaven, Dante has all go, with
exceptions of those like Boethius, Francis, and Cacciaguida, the
auspicious few, according to Isidoro del Lungo (in an unspecified
text); i.e., Dante's view is the exact counterpart, if in opposition,
to that of Thomas.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XI.109-117.

	|128.~  Luca Curti ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~,
ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002],
p. 159) reminds us that Augustine's remains were ca. 725 removed from
Sardegna (where they had been taken from Hippo) and taken to Pavia by
the Lombard king, Liutprand, who reinterred them in the basilica of
Cieldauro.  Where might Dante have learned this?  In the opinion of
Curti, from the ^Chronicon~ of the Venerable Bede (present in verse
131).  (Casini/Barbi [comm. to this verse] had already pointed out that
^both~ Augustine and Boethius were reburied beneath imposing monuments
in that church by Liutprand.)

	|130-131.~  Isidore (bishop) of Seville compiled one of the first great
medieval encyclopedias in the seventh century, his twenty books of
^Etymologies~.  He was, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through
the derivative work of Uguccione da Pisa), one of Dante's main
authorities on any number of subjects.

	|131.~  The Venerable Bede, the ecclesiastical historian of Britain,
lived well into the eighth century.  See Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le
figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori,
2001], pp. 283-91) for claims on behalf of the writings of Bede
(^Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum~, ^De natura rerum~, ^De
metrica arte~) as hitherto unexplored sources for a number of passages
in the ^Commedia~.

	|131-132.~  Richard of St. Victor wrote during the twelfth century.  He
and his master, Hugo of St. Victor (for whom see ^Par~. XII.133), were
mystical theologians in the monastery of St. Victor near Paris.  "He
was said to be a native of Scotland, celebrated scholastic philosopher
and theologian, chief of the mystics of the twelfth century.  He was,
with Peter Lombard, a pupil of the famous Hugh of St. Victor, and a
friend of St. Bernard, to whom several of his works are dedicated; he
died at St. Victor in 1173.  His writings, which are freely quoted by
Thomas Aquinas, consist of commentaries on parts of the Old Testament,
St. Paul's epistles, and the Apocalypse, as well as of works on moral
and dogmatic subjects, and on mystical contemplation, the last of which
earned him the title of 'Magnus Contemplator'" (Toynbee, "Ugo da San
Vittore" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Dante, in his ^Epistle to
Cangrande~ (^Epist~. XIII.28), when justifying his dealing with
transcendental subjects in the ^Paradiso~, appeals to Richard's work
^De contemplatione~.

	|133-138.~  Siger of Brabant, thirteenth-century philosopher and
theologian who taught at the Faculty of the Arts of the Sorbonne,
located near "the Street of Straw," the Rue du Fouarre in Paris (one of
the few pieces of "evidence" seized on by those who believe, as few
today do, that Dante visited Paris; but the street's name was
apparently widely known; and Dante might have heard details about the
theological disputes in Paris, for instance from the Dominican Remigio
dei Girolami, who had studied with St. Thomas in Paris and who lectured
at S. Maria Novella between 1289 and 1303).  In 1270 Thomas wrote his
^De Unitate intellectus contra averroistas~, clearly attacking some of
Siger's teaching (along with that of others).  Between 1270 and 1277
Siger was prosecuted by the archbishop of Paris $Etienne Tempier (and
in 1276 by the inquisitor for France, Simon du Val) for heretical ideas
and found guilty.  He went to Orvieto to face the Roman Curia and
apparently owned up to his wayward philosophizing, and perhaps was
absolved for it.  He then stayed in Orvieto, in a condition perhaps
resembling house arrest, where he apparently met his death beneath the
knife of a mad cleric, possibly a man assigned to him as a servant, ca.
1283-84.  The author of ^Il Fiore~ (XCII.9-11) mentions Siger's
terrible end.  For a compact bibliography of Siger's extensive body of
work, those considered genuine, those possibly or probably by others,
and those now lost, as well as a short list of studies of his impact on
Dante, see Cesare Vasoli, "Sigieri (Sighieri) di Brabante," ^ED~ V
(1976), pp. 241b-42a.  For a study that considers the clash in the
^Commedia~ of intellectual pride (as represented by Guido Cavalcanti)
and great-souled humility (as represented by Saint Francis), see Marco
Veglia ("Per un'ardita umilt@a.  L'averroismo di Dante tra Guido
Cavalcanti, Sigieri di Brabante e San Francesco d'Assisi," ^Schede
Umanistiche~ 1 [2000]: 67-106).  He argues that this clash is seen in
action first with respect to heresy (^Inf~. X), then with respect to
art (^Purg~. X and XI), and finally with respect to philosophy and
theology (^Par~. X and XI); he sees the parallels established by the
numbers of the cantos involved confirming evidence for his thesis.
Naturally, Siger plays a major role in Veglia's considerations.

For a revisionary presentation of the entire question of Dante's
opinion of Siger, see Ruedi Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les
la,ics~ [Fribourg: Editions Universitaires, 1996], pp. 141-48), who
opposes both Bruno Nardi's basic view (Siger had in fact not said
anything heretical) and Maria Corti's (he had indeed, but when
challenged, eschewed his Averroism and offered his repentance and a
softening of his earlier thought).  Imbach goes on to point out that
Dante on at least one occasion (see the note to ^Par~. XXIX.79-80)
indeed seems to go out of his way to embrace one of Siger's heretical
ideas (that the angels have no memory).  But see the note to ^Par~.
XXIX.82-84.  For recent work on the problems afflicting attempts to
come to grips with the complicated issues surrounding the tormented
question of Dante's view(s) of Siger, see, among others, Giuseppe
Mazzotta ("Dante's Siger of Brabant: Logic and Vision," in ^Dante:
Summa Medievalis~, ed. Charles Franco and Leslie Morgan [Stony Brook,
NY: ^Forum Italicum~, 1995], pp. 40-51) and Luca Curti ("Canto X," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002]), pp. 158-64.  And see
Scott ("Il Sigieri dantesco rivisitato," ^LIA~ 8 [forthcoming 2007?]),
a draft of which the author was kind enough to share.

On the possible intellect, the doctrine developed by Averroes from
Aristotle's ^De anima~ (III.4-8) and denied by Thomas, but admired by
Dante, see Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les la,ics~ [Fribourg:
Editions Universitaires], pp. 174-79); for Dante's "adjustments" to his
precursors' provisions so as to make the possible intellect square with
Christian views of the immortality of the soul, see pp. 180-89.  For
the question of the freedom of the will in Siger, see Christopher J.
Ryan ("Man's Free Will in the Works of Siger de Brabant," ^Mediaeval
Studies~ 45 [1981]: 155-99).

For an invaluable survey of the state of the question regarding the
interrelationships among Aristotle, Averroes, Albertus Magnus, and
Aquinas, as they affect Dante's own philosophical views, see the first
half of the study by Simon Gilson ("Rimaneggiamenti danteschi di
Aristotele: ^gravitas~ e ^levitas~ nella ^Commedia~," in ^Le culture di
Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario dantesco internazionale~, ed.
Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence: Cesati, 2004], pp. 151-77).
For a brief but most helpful summary in English of the strands of
Dante's Aristotelianism, see Scott, "Aristotle" (in Lansing, ed.,
^Dante Encyclopedia~ [New York: Garland, 2000], pp. 61-65).  For a
discussion of the major "heresies" current in Dante's time, see Adriano
Comollo (^Il dissenso religioso in Dante~ [Florence: Olschki, 1990]).
In an e-mail of 4 September 2005, Prof. E. Jeffrey Richards suggested
that Dante put Siger next to Thomas as a gesture against Tempier's
virulent accusations in 1277, not only (clearly if not nominally)
against Siger, but against the equally unnamed Thomas as well.  Thus
one of the tasks of this canto may be seen as essentially Dante's
presentation of his reaction to Tempier's attack on the new champions
of Aristotle's authority, including the wide spectrum represented by
Albertus Magnus (the least virulent of the new men), Thomas Aquinas (in
the middle, literally, of Dante's panoply), and Siger de Brabant (the
most extreme).  We in the twenty-first century may not have enough feel
for the huge change in theology wrought by the rediscovery of Aristotle
in the thirteenth century.  Dante clearly felt himself drawn to the new
philosophy, as is evident by his placing Aristotle higher than Plato as
a figure of classical philosophical authority, as is first reflected in
the ^Commedia~ in ^Inferno~ IV.131.

	|133-135.~  What the reader is supposed to understand about these
thoughts that made death seem welcome to Siger is debated; perhaps it
is his concern, mirrored in his retraction in or perhaps after 1276,
that his earlier erring notions might condemn him to damnation in God's
eyes, despite his finally having chosen the true faith.  To some it has
seemed possible that Dante may have decided that Siger was particularly
worried about embracing the doctrine of the existence of "double truth"
^(duplex veritas~ or ^double v$erit$e) --~ but the first Dante
commentator who seems to have used the phrase is Sapegno [comm. to
verse 136 ]), i.e., the positing of the possibility of something being
true by rational standards (e.g., the proposition "all men are mortal")
while its contradictory is considered true on the basis of faith (e.g.,
the "immortality" of Jesus).  However, for a flat denial that Siger
ever embraced this concept, see Fernand Van Steenberghen (^Ma#itre
Siger de Brabant~ [Louvain: Publications universitaires, 1977]), pp.
151, 242-43, 248-50 (and see the chapter, "Siger dans la ^Divine
Com$edie~," pp. 165-76; see also esp. pp. 23-26).  Dante, who had not
read Van Steenberghen, may have joined in this widely shared (if
erroneous) opinion, deriving from Tempier's accusation that his
"Averroist" enemies held exactly such dangerous opinions.  Despite the
confusions of some modern critics (principally Father Mandonnet), Van
Steenberghen argues that there is not a shred of evidence that Siger
embraced that position.  He did indeed observe that philosophy and
theology operated in different ways, but always, according to Van
Steenberghen, privileged theology.  Cesare Vasoli ("Sigieri," ^ED~ V
[1976], pp. 238a-242b) is less certain of Siger's sincerity in hewing
to this line (since it was dangerous, as he would find out if he did
not already know, even to be suspected of harboring such doubts).
Dante may have decided that his appearance before the Roman Curia in
Orvieto "cured" him of his heretical bent, and that, when he was
murdered, he was living in the bosom of Mother Church.  For a major
study, revaluating Thomas's little treatise and making it the
cornerstone of his thought and the high point in medieval
Aristotelianism, see Alain de Libera, ^L'unit$e de l'intellect:
Commentaire du "De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas" de Thomas
d'Aquin~ (Paris: Vrin, 2004).

	|138.~  See Giampiero Tulone ("Gli 'invidiosi veri' nella ^Commedia~ e
nelle fonti dantesche," ^Lettere Italiane~ 52 [2000]: 345-78) for a
review of the problem caused by the phrase ^invidiosi veri~ (enviable
truths).  Tulone's hypothesis is that Dante's text refers to the envy
of those who hypocritically oppose Siger's sound doctrinal teaching by
claiming it is other than Christian.  And see Giuseppe Mazzotta ("The
Heaven of the Sun: Dante between Aquinas and Bonaventure," in ^Dante
for the New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey
[New York: Fordham University Press, 2003], p. 155), who is of the
opinion that ^invidiosi~ means "not logically evident or demonstrable,"
on what grounds it is difficult to say.  Benvenuto (comm. to vv.
133-138) distinguishes between the words ^invidiosus~ and ^invidus~ as
follows: "invidiosus enim est ille cui invidetur propter suam
felicitatem: et sic capitur in bona parte; invidus vero est ille qui
invidet alteri; et sic capitur in mala parte" (for the man who is
^invidiosus~ is one who is envied because of his happiness, and the
word is then understood positively; the man who is ^invidus~, on the
other hand, is one who is envious of another, and the word is then
understood negatively).  Luca Curti ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 162), while not referring to Benvenuto,
may have cited one of the fourteenth-century commentator's sources:
Isidore of Seville (^Etym~. X.134): One who is ^invidus~ envies the
happiness of another, while the man who is ^invidiosus~ suffers the
envy of others.  Benvenuto intrinsically disagrees with the glosses of
Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 133-138) and of the Ottimo (comm to vv.
133-138), both of whom believe that the syllogisms "envy the truth"
("hanno invidia al vero"), in the sense that they themselves lack the
properties possessed by the truth.  As for the word ^silogizz@o~ (which
we have translated as "demonstrated"), from the beginning there has
been dispute as to whether it is to be taken negatively or positively.
Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 133-138) argues that these syllogisms
are untrue, while Benvenuto da Imola (commenting on the same passage)
is of the opposite opinion, namely that the syllogisms of Siger's
making are indeed truthful, and for that reason the subject of envy on
the part of those who heard and admired them.  Over the years a large
majority of the commentators are of Benvenuto's opinion; and see Marco
Veglia ("Per un'ardita umilt@a.  L'averroismo di Dante tra Guido
Cavalcanti, Sigieri di Brabante e San Francesco d'Assisi," ^Schede
Umanistiche~ 1 [2000]: 103 and note) for a concordant reflection.  That
Siger is saved has undoubtedly contributed to the forming of this view;
the words themselves might seem far less generous in a different
context.  See, for example, the second verse of the next canto.

	|139-148.~  According to Scott (^Understanding Dante~ [Notre Dame:
Notre Dame University Press, 2004], p. 297), this is the first
reference in literature to a mechanical clock.  He cites Dronke
("'Orizzonte che rischiari,'" in his ^Dante and Medieval Latin
Traditions~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986 {1975}], pp.
101-2), who suggests that Dante might have seen the one built in Milan
in 1306 when he was there for the coronation of Henry VII (in 1310).
And see Moevs ("Miraculous Syllogisms: Clocks, Faith and Reason in
^Paradiso~ 10 and 24," ^Dante Studies~ 117 [1999]: 59-84) for the
nature and location of clocks in Dante's time.  It is hardly credible,
as a distinguished scholar who will be allowed to remain anonymous said
in a recent lecture, that the scene is meant to put us in mind of a
Florentine husband readying himself for getting into bed with his wife
while a clock in their bedroom tolls the hour, as the scene is clearly
a morning one, and as it would be many years before mechanical clocks
of that small size and portability were available.  This is not that
sort of sound, but one of chimes from a (distant?) clock tower.

	|140-141.~  Ronald Martinez, in a paper he prepared for the
International Dante Seminar (at the University of Notre Dame in
September 2003), believed that these verses echo Solomon's song (Cant.
3:1): "In lectulo meo, per noctes, quaesivi quem diligit anima mea,
Quaesivi illum, et non inveni, Surgam, et circuibo civitatem..." (By
night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I
found him not; I will arise now, and go about the city...).  The Song
of Solomon certainly offers analogues to the expression of love found
here, but the time of day in this passage is off: it is night and not
dawn.  (The fact that Martinez omitted this passage from the eventual
printed version ["The Poetics of Advent Liturgies: Dante's ^Vita Nova~
and ^Purgatorio~," in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ {Florence:
Cesati, 2004}, pp. 271-304] does not indicate that he has changed his
mind; his paper was three times its printable length.  The finished
version is an important contribution to our knowledge of how some
biblical texts may have found their way to Dante's attention from
liturgical sources.)

	|144.~  For ^turge~ see Lino Pertile (^La punta del disio: Semantica
del desiderio nella "Commedia"~ [Fiesole: Cadmo, 2005], pp. 173-76),
pointing out, with numerous examples, that the word has never before
been used, in Latin, with a sexual denotation, a meaning it acquired
only later on.  Dante, having conflated love and intellect, at least by
the opening of this canto, can use the vocabularies interchangeably, or
substitute the former for the latter, as he does here.  Psychologists
refer to another version of this process as sublimation, an attempt to
skirt a painful awareness of sexual desire by replacing it with a more
"acceptable" activity.  In Jesus' teaching (e.g., the wise virgins
preparing for the arrival of the bridegroom [Matth. 25:1-13]) we can
see a more positive sense of sexuality, if it is also simultaneously
seen as the basis for its own supersession, taking carnal pleasure past
its physical expression and its physical limits.  E.g., "If you enjoy
the thought of consummating a marriage, oh, will you enjoy the kingdom
of Heaven!"  It would seem likely that Dante's transposition of terms
generally associated with sexual desire to descriptions of the longing
for God, as innovative as it may seem to be, is in fact a continuation
of a highly similar practice in Jesus' teaching, as it is found with
some frequency in the Gospels.
