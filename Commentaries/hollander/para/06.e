	|1-27.~  Justinian's response to Dante's first inquiry allows the poet
to present his version of the biography of the emperor who codified
Roman law.  "Justinian I, surnamed the Great, emperor of
Constantinople, A.D. 527-565.  Justinian is best known for his
legislation.  He appointed a commission of jurists to draw up a
complete body of law, which resulted in the compilation of two great
works; one, called ^Digesta~ or ^Pandectae~ (533), in fifty books,
contained all that was valuable in the works of preceding jurists; the
other, called ^codex constitutionum~, consisted of a collection of the
imperial constitutions.  To these two works was subsequently added an
elementary treatise in four books, under the title of ^Institutiones~
(533); and at a later period Justinian published various new
constitutions, to which he gave the name of ^Novellae constitutiones~
(534-65).  These four works, under the general name of ^Corpus iuris
civilis~, form the Roman law as received in Europe" (Toynbee,
"Giustiniano" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

The sixth canto in each ^cantica~, as has often been appreciated, is
devoted to an increasingly wide political focus: first to Florentine
politics, then to Italian politics, and now to Dante's theologically
charged imperial politics.  For a clear statement of what had become
the standard view, see Paolo Brezzi ("Canto VI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
p. 176).  The three spokesmen for these three subjects are also of
increasing distinction: Ciacco, Sordello, and Justinian; we get another
clue as to Dante's high esteem for Ciacco, despite his deforming
gluttony and resulting damnation.

The canto is divided into four parts, the first and third as direct
responses to Dante's preceding questions (^Par~. V.127-129).  The
second (vv. 28-111) is coyly characterized by Justinian himself, here
serving as Dante's stand-in, as a "digression" (^alcuna giunta~ --
verse 30).  It is not only the longest but is also clearly the central
element in Justinian's discourse.  The final section (vv. 127-142) is
devoted to a second spirit in Mercury, Romeo di Villanova.  Nicol@o
Mineo ("Canto VI," in ^"Paradiso": Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~, dir. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1987}], pp. 91-92), believes that
the theme holding this canto together is earthly justice.  And see
Francesco Mazzoni ("Il canto VI del ^Paradiso~," ^Letture classensi~
9-10 [1982]: 159).  We need look no further than the first line of his
^Institutiones~ (I.i.1) to see how important that concept was to this
man, who had the root of the word inscribed in his very name (^iustus~
is Latin for "just"): "Iustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas ius
suum cuique tribuens" (Justice is the constant and perpetual desire to
render each his due).

For an interesting early and global attempt to deal with the historical
details (and some of their sources) lying behind this canto's
presentation of Dante's ideas about Roman history, see Jacopo della
Lana's lengthy proemial remarks in his commentary to this canto.  And
for the relation between the political concerns expressed in this canto
and Dante's previous expressions of concern, in the ^opere minori~, for
the earthly welfare of the human race, especially that part of it
residing on the Italian peninsula, see Mazzoni ("Il canto VI del
^Paradiso~," ^op. cit.~, pp. 119-32.)

	|1.~  It has been suggested (by Hollander in ^Dante: A Life in Works~
[New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001], p. 140) that this canto, the
only one in the poem spoken by a single voice, is a sort of Dantean
version of a miniaturized ^Aeneid~, become, in this handling, a
theologized history of Rome.  This first verse lends aid to such a
view, as it rather dramatically opens this "mini-epic" ^in medias res~,
as indeed did the poem that contains it (see the note to ^Inferno~
I.1).  In this connection, it is perhaps worth noting that, according
to some, the canto both begins and ends with a not-very-noticeable
citation of the ^Aeneid~.  The first words of ^Paradiso~ VI, "Poscia
che," may reflect, according to Torraca (comm. to vv. 1-3), ^Aeneid~
III.1, "Postquam."  Scevola Mariotti ("Il canto VI del ^Paradiso~," in
^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. V [Florence: Le Monnier, 1972], pp.
378-82), revisits Torraca's observation, showing how other elements in
^Aeneid~ III.1-6 leave their mark on this passage in Dante, and
concludes by noting that ^Aeneid~ III, like ^Paradiso~ VI, is spoken by
a single voice (it doesn't hurt his case that it belongs to "pater
Aeneas") except for its final three lines.  And then, as Daniello
(comm. to vv. 139-141) first and then Scartazzini (comm. to verse 1)
argued, the penultimate verse (141) in this canto contains the phrase
"a frusto a frusto" (a word not used elsewhere in the poem), a calque
on ^Aeneid~ I.212: "Pars in ^frusta~ secant" (some cut it into pieces
-- tr. H.R. Fairclough).  Mineo ("Canto VI," in ^"Paradiso": Lectura
Dantis Neapolitana~, dir. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000
{1987}], p. 144) seizes upon this evidence, citing Scartazzini (but not
Daniello), to make the argument for a Virgilian beginning and ending to
the canto.  Scartazzini finds himself here thinking of Dante's sad
words about his own poverty-stricken exile (^Conv~. I.iii.3): "Ah, if
only it had pleased the Maker of the Universe that the cause of my
apology had never existed, for then neither would others have sinned
against me, nor would I have suffered punishment unjustly -- the
punishment, I mean, of exile and poverty" (tr. R. Lansing).

The uniqueness of Justinian's canto, the only one in the poem dedicated
to a single speaker and to the longest single speech in the poem,
reflects the phenomenon addressed in great detail by E.H. Wilkins
("Voices of the ^Divine Comedy~," ^Annual Report of the Dante Society~
79 [1961)]: 3): the third ^cantica~ has fewer speakers, but these speak
at greater length than do most of those found in the first two
canticles.

	|2-3.~  The Eagle, symbol of the Roman Empire, originally, with Aeneas,
followed the course of the heavens, encircling the earth from east to
west.  Subsequently, it moved from west (Italy) to east
(Constantinople), where Constantine had transferred the seat of empire
in 330, and where Justinian governed from 527 until 565.

Aeneas's taking Lavinia to wife, not recounted in the ^Aeneid~, is the
only Virgilian detail that is reprocessed in Justinian's epic narrative.

	|4-6.~  Dante's chronology is different from that of most historians;
he perhaps reflects one tradition found in some manuscripts of Brunetto
Latini's ^Tresor~, which has it that the initial transfer took place in
333 (and not in 330), and that Justinian assumed the eastern throne
only in 539 (and not in 527), some 206 years later, thus accounting for
Dante's error (in verse 4: "two hundred years and more").  For
speculation regarding these dates in relation to Dante's sense of
imperial prophecy in the ^Aeneid~, see Robert Hollander and Heather
Russo ("^Purgatorio~ 33.43: Dante's 515 and Virgil's 333," ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [March 2003]).

The mountains of the Troad, in Asia Minor, are presented as the site of
Troy.

	|4.~  For Dante's phrase "the bird of God" (^l'uccel di Dio~), see its
earlier presence in slightly different form: "l'uccel di Giove"
(^Purg~. XXXII.112).

	|7.~  Justinian's words allow a reader to glimpse the heavily
theologized nature of this history lesson.  The citation (first noted
by Baldassare Lombardi, in his comm. to this verse, of Psalm 16:8
(17:8), "sub umbra alarum tuarum" (beneath the shadow of your wings),
building on the phrase "l'uccel di Dio" (the bird of God) in verse 4,
invests the passage with a sense of divinity that is surely and
specifically Christian.

	|8-9.~  The succession of the emperors has, in Dante, much the same
feeling as that of the popes.  One feels in both the presence of divine
selection.  It is not even a paradox that in Dante a greater solemnity
is associated with the emperors, seen as carrying out God's work even
before there were Christian emperors.

	|10.~  This verse performs a perfectly balanced five-word chiasmus:

\<pre\>
			Cesare			       Iustin,iano
				fui		son
					e
\</pre\>

Justinian ^was~ a ruler and ^is~ a citizen of Heaven.

This verse makes a reader mindful of that classical (and modern) poetic
convention in which the dead open a colloquy with passersby through the
agency of the words inscribed on their tombstones; see Stefano Carrai
("Canto VI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 99-105).

	|11-12~.  One key element in Justinian's self-presentation as inspired
lawgiver is perhaps surprisingly similar to a key element in Dante's
self-description as inspired poet (see ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.52-54 and the
note to that tercet).  Hollander ("Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the
^Comedy~," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario
dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence:
Cesati, 1999], pp. 279-81), calls attention to the similarity in the
presentations of Dante and Justinian as divinely inspired writers; see
vv. 23-24, below: "It pleased God, in His grace, to grant me
inspiration / in the noble task to which I wholly gave myself."
Support for this view may be found in Silvia Conte ("Giustiniano e
l'ispirazione divina dei ^Digesta~," ^L'Alighieri~ 27 [2006]: 25-40).

It may seem odd that Dante thought of the ^Digesta~, Justinian's great
winnowing of Roman law into fifty volumes, as having been inspired by
the Holy Spirit -- but not much more so than that he could have made
the same claim for his own poetry.  Moments like these make it
difficult to deny the daring of the claims this poet makes for the
veracity of his own fiction.  He had to know how much discomfort this
claim would cause, broadening, as it does, the range of those to whom
the Spirit had chosen to speak beyond the wildest imagining.  (See
Mazzoni ["Il canto VI del ^Paradiso~," ^Letture classensi~ 9-10 {1982}:
139-40], for acknowledgment of this dimension of Dante's strategy
[which may seem surprising to those who wish to keep theology and
politics separate], pointing to Kantorowicz's previous and entirely
similar understanding.)

The words "[il] primo amor ch'i' sento" are potentially problematic.
We have followed tradition in translating the verb ^sentire~ as meaning
"feel."  However, it certainly could mean "hear."  The verb is used
some 92 other times in the poem; in some 32 of these mean "hear," while
in some 60 it indicates a more general sense of sense perception.  See
the clear examples of both meanings in a single verse: ^Purgatorio~
XXIV.38.  Thus we have no reason to believe it could not mean "hear"
here.  And see the parallel with the phrase "ch'i'odo" at ^Purgatorio~
XXIV.57, pointed out by Hollander ("Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the
^Comedy~," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario
dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence:
Cesati, 1999], p. 279).

	|13-18.~  Justinian confesses that he had believed in the monophysite
heresy, embraced by Eutyches, which allowed Jesus only a divine nature,
that is, denied His humanity.  Credit for bringing his view into
conformity with orthodoxy is conferred upon Pope Agapetus I (533-536).
As Carroll points out (comm. to vv. 1-27), however, Dante has, whether
innocently or not, twisted several facts in order to manufacture his
version of a Justinian cured of heresy before he did his inspired work
on Roman law, e.g., Agapetus came to Constantinople only ^after~ the
books were finished, while Dante's account (vv. 22-24) is quite
different.  Our poet simply must have a Christian compiler of the laws
that were to govern Christian Europe; and so he manages to find
("create" might be the better word) him.

	|19-21.~  Agapetus is given credit for arguing his case so convincingly
that Justinian was persuaded, as would be a contemporary of Dante, by
Aristotle's "law of contradictories." Tozer (comm. to this tercet)
paraphrases as follows: "'[Agapetus's] article of faith (the two
Natures in Christ) I now see clearly, in the same way as you see that
of two contradictories one must be false, the other true'; i.e. not as
a matter of opinion or inference, but with absolute certainty."

	|22-24.~  Justinian now makes still more specific the dependence of his
legal writing on the Holy Spirit.  (See the note to vv. 11-12.)  Dante
is insistent in establishing the emperor's conversion as preceding his
formulation of the laws, no matter what the facts may have been.

	|25-27.~  Belisarius (ca. 500-565), Justinian's greatest general, is
portrayed by Dante in unproblematic and glowing terms, either despite
what the poet knew of his eventual difficulties with his emperor or in
ignorance of them.  If Dante did know the extravagant and unverified
tale (but he may not have, we must remember) that Justinian finally had
all his possessions stripped from Belisarius and also had him blinded,
we would sense even more strongly how willing he was to let the
ideality of the situation trump its actuality.  For here is a realm
that a Dante can love, its supreme leader completely dedicated to the
practical intellectual concerns of governance, the law, while his
"right hand," loyal and true, takes care of problems with the Vandals
in Africa and the Goths in Italy.  In any case, this pair of heroic
figures offers Dante an emblem of the successful collaboration between
representatives of the active and of the contemplative life (here in
the form of the lower part of Boethius's familiar binome, practical
[rather than theoretical] thought; see ^Cons. Phil~. I.1[pr.]).

This is, according to the ^Grande Dizionario~, one of the very few
times in the history of the Italian language that the verb ^commendare~
is used to signify "affidare" (entrust) -- the only other example put
forward comes from Castiglione two centuries later.  In Dante the word
more usually signifies "praise, celebrate."

	|30.~  Narrowing the principal activity of his own life on behalf of
Rome triggers in Justinian the need to "add" something more, a
"digression" of sorts (vv. 34-111), which naturally enough, given that
he is speaking for his author, has begun (vv. 31-33) by touching on the
criminally irresponsible struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines in
Dante's Italy.  It will, also naturally enough, conclude with the same
concern (vv. 97-111).  Thus ancient history has a most modern relevance
and is framed by that topic.

	|31-33.~  The outcome of the struggle of the Eagle, a great Hegelian
bird moving through history to make manifest the Spirit, is hardly a
cause for optimism, at least not at the moment in which Dante is
writing.  The "covers" of Justinian's historical essay both depict the
disastrous present day in Italy.  The ensuing narrative of the Eagle's
flight through time and space is put to the service of showing that it
has become the corrupt emblem of a corrupt party (the Ghibellines of
1300), opposed by equally corrupt Guelphs.

Justinian speaks ironically (employing the trope ^antiphrasis~, saying
the opposite of what is meant).

	|34-96.~  The core of the canto, offering what is perhaps the poem's
crucial political self-definition, presenting an absolutely unorthodox
"history of the Caesars," i.e., one principally shaped by a Christian
point of view, is divided into sixteen segments:

\<pre\>
	(1) death of Pallas (35-36)
	(2) Ascanius founds Alba Longa (37-38)
	(3) Horatians' victory over the Curiatii (39)
	(4) kings: rape of the Sabines (Romulus) (40)
	(5) kings: rape of Lucretia (the Tarquins) (41-42)
	(6) republic: vs. Gauls of Brennus (43-44)
	(7) republic: vs. Tarentini of Pyrrhus (44-45)
	(8) republic: Torquatus and Cincinnatus (46)
	(9) republic: Decii and Fabii (47-48)
	(10) republic: defeat of Hannibal (49-51)
	(11) republic: Scipio and Pompey (vs. Catiline) (52-54)
	(12) empire: Julius Caesar (55-72)
	(13) empire: Augustus Caesar (73-84)
	(14) empire: Tiberius Caesar (85-90)
	(15) empire: Titus (91-93)
	(16) empire: Charlemagne (94-96)
\</pre\>

	|34.~  The Eagle is marked by ^virt@u~ (usually "power" but, at times,
as here, "virtue"), precisely what the opposing Italian political
parties lack.  The ensuing list of virtuous founding presences harps
upon the moral virtues that separated Romans from their enemies.  See
^Convivio~ IV.iv.11 for an earlier expression of Dante's firm belief in
the moral superiority of the Romans: "Therefore, since this office
[rulership] could not be attained without the greatest virtue, and
since its exercise required the greatest and most humane kindness, this
was the people best disposed to receive it" (tr. R. Lansing).

	|35-36.~  Roman imperial virtue begins with the death of Pallas, son of
Evander.  Despite the special protection of Aeneas, Pallas is killed in
battle by Turnus (^Aen~. X.479-489).  Thus the founding event of the
empire is presented here as the death of Pallas, an event that seems to
have the status of sacrifice.  For a discussion in this vein, see
Rachel Jacoff ("Sacrifice and Empire: Thematic Analogies in San Vitale
and the ^Paradiso~," in ^Renaissance Studies in Honor of Craig Hugh
Smyth~, ed. Andrew Morrogh ^et al~. [Florence: Giunti Barb@era, 1985],
pp. 317-32).  The death of Cato has a similar resonance; he died for
liberty, as Virgil tells Dante (^Purg~. I.71-72; and see the note to
vv. 71-74).  Pallas dies in order to give virtue a homeland in Italy
where, for a time at least, it prospered.  "His death led to that of
Turnus, because Aeneas would have spared the latter's life, had he not
seen the belt of Pallas, which [Turnus] was wearing (^Aen~.
XII.940-950).  By Turnus' death Aeneas became possessed of Lavinia, and
of the kingdom of Latinus.  Thus the death of Pallas ultimately caused
the eagle to obtain the sovereignty" (Tozer's commentary to vv. 35-36).

For Dante's earlier view of the death of Pallas, see ^Monarchia~
II.ix.14.

	|37-39.~  Dante refers to Alba Longa, "the most ancient town in Latium,
built according to tradition by Ascanius, son of Aeneas" (Toynbee,
"Alba" ([Concise Dante Dictionary]).  The Eagle would remain there some
three hundred years until the defeat of the local Curiatii by the Roman
Horatii.

	|40-42.~  Dante (^Conv~. IV.v.11) includes three Tarquins among the
first seven kings of Rome: " ... the seven kings who first governed her
-- namely Romulus, Numa, Tullus, Ancus, and the Tarquin kings who were
the rulers and the tutors, so to speak, of her youth" (tr. R. Lansing).
 That means Dante counts the sixth king, Tullius Servius, related by
marriage but not by birth, as one of the Tarquins, as Toynbee explains
("Tarquinii" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

It is probably significant that the first period of Roman history is
marked, at either end, by rape, that of the Sabine women in Romulus's
rule, and that of Lucrece by her husband's cousin, Sextus Tarquinius,
son of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, seventh king of Rome.  That second
act of sexual violence eventually had the result of ending Tarquin rule
(510 B.C.).

	|43-45.~  Dante records two major military victories of the ensuing
republican period.  "Brennus, leader of the Senonian Gauls, who in 390
B.C. crossed the Apennines, defeated the Romans at the Allia, and took
Rome; after besieging the capitol for six months he quitted the city
upon receiving 1,000 pounds of gold as a ransom for the capitol and
returned home safe with his booty.  According to later tradition
(followed by Livy), at the moment when the gold was being weighed and
Brennus, declaring the Roman weights to be false, had thrown his sword
into the scale, Camillus and a Roman army appeared, fell upon the
Gauls, and slaughtered them" (Toynbee, "Brenno" ([Concise Dante
Dictionary]).  "Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, born 318 B.C., died 272 B.C.;
he claimed descent from Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles and great-grandson
of Aeacus.  In 280 Pyrrhus crossed over into Italy at the invitation of
the Tarentines to help them in their war against the Romans" (Toynbee,
"Pirro-2" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

This tercet begins a passage dedicated to the Roman republic (vv.
43-54).  For a clear understanding of Dante's allegiance to republican
ideals and principles, see Charles Davis, "Ptolemy of Lucca and the
Roman Republic" (1974) and "Roman Patriotism and Republican Propaganda:
Ptolemy of Lucca and Pope Nicholas III" (1975), both reprinted in
^Dante's Italy and Other Essays~ (Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1984), pp. 254-89 and 224-53, respectively; and see
Robert Hollander and Albert Rossi ("Dante's Republican Treasury,"
^Dante Studies~ 104 [1986]: 59-82) and the note to ^Paradiso~
XXVII.61-63.

	|45.~  The words ^principi e collegi~ refer to other political
organisms on the peninsula, whether kingdoms or republics; for
^collegi~ with this meaning, Porena (comm. to this verse) cites
^Monarchia~ II.v.7: these bodies "seem in some sense to function as a
bond between individuals and the community" (tr. P. Shaw).

	|46.~  "Titus Manlius, surnamed Torquatus, from the collar (^torques~)
which he took from a fallen foe; and Quinctius, surnamed Cincinnatus,
or the 'curly-haired'" (Longfellow, comm. on this verse).

	|47.~  The Decii and the Fabii: "Decii, famous Roman family, three
members of which, father, son, and grandson, all bearing the same name,
Publius Decius Mus, sacrificed their lives for their country" (Toynbee,
"Deci" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]); "the Fabii, ancient patrician
family at Rome, which claimed descent from Hercules and the Arcadian
Evander.  It is celebrated as having furnished a long line of
distinguished men" (Toynbee, "Fabi" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|48.~  Dante uses a rare (or coins his own new) verb, ^mirrare~,
meaning "to embalm" or "to preserve with myrrh."  See Scartazzini
(comm. to this verse) for an acerbic discussion of the vagaries of the
ancient debate over this word.  Some early commentators think Dante was
only deliberately (because of the exigencies of rhyme) misspelling
^miro~ (admire) with a double "rr"; others see that it means
"preserve," as Scartazzini argues it indeed does, if he dislikes any
sense of the odoriferous, favored by some but inappropriate, in his
view, in Paradise.

	|49-51.~  To refer to the Carthaginians as Arabs is (as Bosco/Reggio
[comm. on this tercet] explain) to commit an anachronism, since Arabs
populated that part of North Africa only in Dante's day, not in Roman
times.  Hannibal (247-183 B.C.) was perhaps the Romans' most glorious
and successful antagonist, over a period of some fifteen years
defeating them in several major battles, until, at the battle of Zama,
in 202 B.C., he was utterly crushed by Scipio (who received his
surname, "Africanus," as a result).  Some may recall George C. Scott,
portraying General George Patton in the eponymous film detailing the
latter's military career, alone before a major tank battle of the North
African campaign in World War II on the battlefield at Zama, reflecting
on Scipio's victorious tactics.

	|52-53.~  "Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major, one of the
greatest of the Romans, born 234 B.C., died ca. 183; while just a youth
he fought against Hannibal at the Battle of the Ticinus (218); he was
elected consul 205, and in the next year crossed over into Africa, and
at last brought to an end the long struggle between Rome and Hannibal
by his decisive victory over the latter at the Battle of Zama, Oct. 19,
202; he returned to Italy in 201, and entered Rome in triumph,
receiving the surname of Africanus in commemoration of his brilliant
services; he served in the war against Antiochus the Great in 190, and,
being afterwards accused of taking bribes from Antiochus, was tried in
Rome in 185, on the anniversary of the Battle of Zama; the prosecution
was, however, dropped, and Scipio left Rome, to which he never
returned; he died not long after, probably in 183" (Toynbee,
"Scipione-1" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  "Pompey the Great, born
106 B.C., died 48 B.C.; in his youth he distinguished himself as a
successful general and earned the surname of Magnus on account of his
victories in the African campaign; he was consul with Crassus in 70
B.C., and in 59 B.C. joined Julius Caesar and Crassus in the first
triumvirate.  Caesar's increasing power made it inevitable that a
struggle for supremacy should take place between them sooner or later,
and in 49 B.C. the Civil War broke out; in the next year Pompey was
completely defeated by Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalia, and fled to
Egypt, where he was murdered by order of Ptolemy's ministers" (Toynbee,
"Pompeo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

Scipio is the Roman hero who is most often referred to by Dante; see
Hollander and Rossi ("Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104
[1986]: 64-68).

	|54.~  The Roman standards seemed bitter to the inhabitants of the
ancient hill town of Fiesole, beneath which lies Dante's Florence, when
the army destroyed it in the war against Catiline.  According to
Giovanni Villani (^Cron~. I.36-37), Pompey was among the generals at
the siege.

	|55-72.~  After seven tercets, each of which is devoted to one event
(and sometimes more) in pre-imperial history, Dante will turn to his
gallery of Roman emperors, one that will eventually resemble no other
such listing ever found.  But he deals with the first of them, Julius,
here.  (Post-Shakespearean readers may need to be reminded that, for
Dante and historians in his time, Julius [and not Augustus] was the
first emperor.)

Dante's "life of Caesar" is immediately put (forced?) into a Christian
context.  It was Julius's task to set the world in better order so that
it would be prepared for the coming of Christ.  Next Dante turns to
Caesar's military triumphs in Gaul (vv. 58-60).  The six rivers
mentioned in these verses may derive from Lucan, ^Pharsalia~ I.399-434,
as is suggested by Scartazzini (comm. to verse 58).

The next four tercets (vv. 61-72) essentially recount the main
Caesarean events of Lucan's version of the civil wars between Julius
and the republicans: (1) his crossing of the Rubicon and march on Rome
(^Phars~. I-III); (2) his attack on the republican forces in Spain
(^Phars~. IV; see ^Purg~. XVIII.101-102); (3) his landing on the
Dalmatian coast in pursuit of Pompey (V-VI); (4) the battle of
Pharsalus, with the death of Cato and flight of Pompey to Egypt, where
he was betrayed and killed by Ptolemy (VII-IX); (5) his tour of some
sites of the Trojan War (IX); (6) his deposition of Ptolemy, placing
Cleopatra in his stead (X); (7) his defeat of Juba, king of Numidia,
one of Pompey's supporters (not included in the unfinished epic, but
since Juba is referred to at some length in ^Phars~. IV.670-824, he was
probably scheduled for a final, sad appearance); (8) a return to Spain,
where Caesar annihilated the remainder of Pompey's followers (Lucan
looks forward to this last battle, at Munda, in ^Phars~. I.40).  While
most of these events seem to have sources in Lucan's text, and follow
the order in which they occur in that text, what is utterly lacking is
Lucan's biting sarcasm about Julius so sharply felt in most of these
scenes.  Indeed, Dante's own hostility toward Julius seems largely
absent from this passage (see William Stull and Robert Hollander ["The
Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 {1991
[1997]}: 33-43], for discussion of Julius's ups and [mainly] downs in
Dante's eyes).  In these lines, as in his presence as an ^exemplum~ of
zeal in ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.101-102 (and see the note to the passage),
only a positive view of Caesar is appropriate, since he is seen here as
the first and theologically necessary emperor of Rome.  The reference
to Troy (vv. 67-68) also seems to have radically different purposes
here and in Lucan; here it ties Julius to the Trojan founders of Rome,
while there (^Pharsalia~ IX.961-1003) it mocks his pretensions.  See
Mineo ("Canto VI," in ^"Paradiso": Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~, dir. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1987}],  pp. 121-29), for the
problematic nature of Dante's changing views of Julius.

	|55-57.~  For Dante's similar sense of "kairos," of the "fullness of
time," under Augustus, see ^Convivio~ IV.v.4-8, a text that also
includes the following details about the birth of Rome: "David was born
when Rome was born -- that is, when Aeneas came to Italy from Troy,
which was the origin of the Roman city, according to written records"
(IV.v.6 [tr. R. Lansing]).  And see ^Monarchia~ I.xvi.2: "That mankind
was then [in the reign of Augustus] happy in the calm of universal
peace is attested by all historians and by famous poets; even the
chronicler of Christ's gentleness deigned to bear witness to it; and
finally Paul called that most happy state 'the fullness of time'
[^plenitudinem temporis~]" (tr. P. Shaw).

	|61-63.~  Here, once more, Dante's apparent sentiments are far from
Lucanian.  This nefarious crime of Julius is treated in this passage as
a great and necessary step forward.  See, however, Dante's previous
harsh treatment of Curio, who encouraged Julius to cross the Rubicon
and march on Rome (^Inf~. XXVIII.97-99).  There the context was the
destruction of the republic; here it is the establishment of the
empire.  For discussion of Dante's apparently contradictory views of
Curio, see Jacques Goudet ("La 'parte per se stesso' e l'impegno
politico di Dante," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VII [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1974], pp. 313-16) and William Stull ("The Lucanian Source of
Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 {1997}]: 27-28).

	|65-66.~  Pompey, although he managed to avoid death at Caesar's hand
in Greece, was betrayed by his host, the young king, Ptolemy, and
killed in Egypt (^Phars~. VIII).

	|69.~  The young king suffers his own misfortune: Julius replaces him
on the throne with Cleopatra.

	|73.~  The word ^baiulo~ here means "standard-bearer."  It refers to
Octavian, the second of Dante's "world-historical" emperors, eventually
known as Augustus Caesar.  The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 73-81) traces it to
the first-conjugation verb ^baiuolo~ (carry).

	|74.~  See ^Inferno~ XXXIV.64-67 for Dante's initial portrayal of this
pair.  Now he adds a detail: They are barking.  In the previous passage
we are told that Brutus is silent, and Cassius is not described as
uttering sounds.  Their "next-door neighbor" in Cocytus, however,
Bocca, does bark (^Inf~. XXXII.105 and 108).  Has Dante conflated that
noise here?  If we decide that such a solution seems unlikely, we are
faced with another loose end in ^Paradiso~ (see the note to ^Par~.
III.34).  But see Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ ([glosses to the
^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001, p. 28), arguing that the phrase "e non fa motto" (^Inf~.
XXXIV.66), apparently used to describe Brutus's silence, in fact is an
ironic understatement on Dante's part, chosen to indicate that Brutus
is indeed barking like a dog in his pain; this is surely an ingenious
attempt to spare Dante from a self-contradiction; it probably fails to
convince, mainly because no one would possibly read the line this way
in its own terms.  It would have been odd for Dante to have waited
patiently for 39 cantos to make his meaning clear; would he not have
preferred to live with readers' misprisions?

	|75.~  Octavian's forces defeated Mark Antony at Modena and also sacked
the city of Perugia.  Tozer points to Lucan (^Phars~. I.40) for a
source: "though to these be added the famine of Perusia and the horrors
of Mutina" (tr. J.D. Duff).

	|76-78.~  Antony, who survived defeat in the battles against the
imperial army in Italy, did not choose to live much longer, after
losing the naval battle near Actium (31 B.C.), and committed suicide.
Cleopatra, fleeing before the imperial ensign, held aloft now by
Octavian, did not choose to die with her lover; she put herself to
death by means of the bite of an asp that she held to her breast (some
commentators insist that she in fact employed two venomous snakes to do
away with herself).  Over the centuries many potential sources have
been cited for the mode of her suicide, which occurred only once she
perceived that, unlike Julius, Octavian was firm against her charms and
intended to take her back to Rome as a captive.  Giorgio Brugnoli
("'Piangene ancor la trista Cleopatra,'" ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 16
[1995]: 89-90) argues that the most likely single source for Dante's
"trista Cleopatra," which he was the first to advance, is found in
Juvenal (^Sat~. II.109), "maesta... Cleopatra" (wretched Cleopatra).

	|79.~  For a possible source, see ^Aeneid~ VIII.685-688, where Antony
is criticized for his deportment with Cleopatra (this scene is one of
those portrayed on the shield that Venus presents to Aeneas, ^Aen~.
VIII.626-731).  As Fairclough points out in his note to this passage,
the "ruddy sea" is the Indian Ocean, not the Red Sea.  The first
commentator to cite this phrase (^litore rubro~) in the ^Aeneid~
(VIII.686) was apparently Scartazzini (comm. to this verse).  Most
modern commentators also cite it, but, like Scartazzini, without noting
that Virgil is not referring to the Red Sea.  If he is in fact citing
the ^Aeneid~, Dante either makes the same mistake his modern
commentators make or else forces the passage out of context, and has
Augustus establishing his dominion over that most propitious part of
the Mediterranean world, where Christ became flesh, as part of the
^plenitudo temporis~ (see the note to vv. 55-57).  And see the note to
^Paradiso~ VII.6 for a possible resonance of another segment of this
Virgilian text.

	|80-81.~  See the great prophecy of Augustus as bearer of world peace
in ^Aeneid~ I.286-296, esp. verse 294, "claudentur Belli portae" (the
gates of War shall be shut), as was first observed by Pietro di Dante
(Pietro1, comm. to vv. 79-81, along with passages from Lucan, esp.
^Phars~. I.62).  For both these ^loci~, see also Tommaseo (comm. to vv.
79-81).

	|81.~  The word ^delubro~ is a Latinism (from ^delubrum~, "temple").

	|82-91.~  "Tiberius Claudius Nero, stepson and adopted son and
successor of Augustus; Roman emperor, A.D. 14-37" (Toynbee, "Tiberius"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  There is apparently a certain
tongue-in-cheek quality to Dante's words in support of his selection of
the third emperor in his most unusual pantheon.  Julius is a bit
problematic, given even Dante's own slurs on his character (see the
notes to ^Purg~. IX.133-138 and ^Purg~. XXVI.77-78), but we understand
that, for Dante and his time, he was the first emperor, and thus a
necessary presiding presence.  About Augustus no one ever could (and no
one ever has wanted to) complain.  But Tiberius (not to mention Titus!)
has caused more than a little discomfort.  And the protagonist does
indeed marvel at these words (in ^Paradiso~ VII.19-24).  But see
^Monarchia~ II.xi.5: "Thus if Christ had not suffered under an
authorised judge, that penalty would not have been a punishment.  And
no judge could be authorised unless he had jurisdiction over the whole
of mankind, since the whole of mankind was punished in that flesh of
Christ 'who bore our sorrows,' as the prophet says.  And Tiberius
Caesar, whose representative Pilate was, would not have had
jurisdiction over the whole of mankind unless the Roman empire had
existed by right" (tr. P. Shaw).

Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 79-81) made clear his amazement at Dante's
having included Tiberius among the great emperors, referring to him as
"the worst sort of successor" to Augustus.  (And see Benvenuto's own
list of seven emperors, dropping Tiberius and Titus in favor of Trajan
and Constantine and adding Theodosius, in the Outline of this canto.)
It is possible that Dante's "final list" is indeed seven, since it
eventually includes Henry VII or his successor (see the note to ^Par~.
XXX.133-138) as the seventh emperor in the line adumbrated here.  See
Hollander and Rossi ("Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104
[1986]: 62 and 78n).

	|88-90.~  Justinian is making the case for the justness of Christ's
death at the hands of the Romans (Pontius Pilate, acting as agent of
Tiberius).  This "vendetta" pursued by the Roman Eagle (as Justinian,
inspired by the justice of God even as he now speaks, insists) is what
makes the accomplishments of even Julius and Augustus seem paltry, for
Christ's death atoned for all previous human sin and made sinners to
come redeemable as well.  Thus the apparently specious hyperbole in the
passage regarding Tiberius (vv. 82-91) must be seen as serious.  His
greatness is precipitated out of the event he presided over, the
Crucifixion.  See Carroll on vv. 82-90: "The wrath is the just anger of
God against the human race for its sins; and the 'doing of vengeance'
is the death of Christ, regarded as the bearing of the punishment
inflicted by that anger.  The extraordinary thing is that Dante regards
the Crucifixion as the supreme glory of Roman justice, inasmuch as it
was the agent by which 'the Living Justice' 'did vengeance for His
wrath.'"

	|88.~  See the quotation of the first line of Justinian's
^Institutiones~ in the note to vv. 1-27.  Again Dante puts words
reflecting the spiration of the Holy Spirit in Justinian's mouth; see
verse 23 and the note to vv. 22-24.  And see ^Inferno~ XXIX.55-57 (and
the note to vv. 54-57) for Dante's association of himself with similar
inspiration, not to mention ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.52-54.  Aversano (^Dante
daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the
author on 11 September 2001, p. 28), is one of the relatively few
commentators to take clear notice of Justinian's insistence on divine
inspiration for his work on Roman law.

	|92-93.~  "Titus, son and successor of Vespasian, Roman emperor, A.D.
79-81; he served under his father in the Jewish wars, and when
Vespasian was proclaimed emperor and returned to Italy in 70 he
remained in Palestine in order to carry on the siege of Jerusalem,
which he captured, after a siege of several months, in September of
that year; in the following year he returned to Rome and celebrated the
conquest of the Jews in a triumph with his father" (Toynbee, "Tito"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  For a clear explanation of this tercet,
see Tozer (comm. to vv. 91-93): "The repetition is that of the word
^vendetta~ in two different applications, corresponding to the twofold
mission of the eagle; first it avenged God's wrath against Adam's sin
(^vendetta del peccato antico~) by putting Christ to death; then it
took vengeance on the Jews for bringing about Christ's death by the
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus."

Giorgio Padoan ("Il Canto VII del ^Paradiso~," ^Lectura Dantis Romana~
[Turin: S.E.I., 1965], pp. 7-17) looks away from the canto of his
^Lectura Dantis Romana~ (^Par~. VII) to consider these verses and their
problematic view of Jewish history.

	|94-96.~  Charlemagne gets short shrift as the sixth (Justinian does
not, of course, refer to himself as a member of this elite group, but
commentators have done so for him) and last of these "world-historical"
emperors.  See Tozer (comm. to these verses): "[W]hen Desiderius, king
of the Lombards, persecuted the Church, Pope Adrian I called in Charles
the Great to its defense.  ^[V]incendo~: by his victory over
Desiderius.  The date of this was 774, and Charles was not crowned
emperor of the West until 800, so that at the time when it took place
he was not under the protection of the Roman eagle (^sotto le sue
ali~).  Dante's error here is of a part with his more serious mistake
in ^Mon.~ [III.xi.1] where he says that Charles was crowned emperor by
Adrian I while the emperor Michael was on the throne of Constantinople
-- whereas in reality he was crowned by Leo III during the reign of
Irene."  The process of ^translatio imperii~ has now been insisted on,
as the Eagle has flown out of Italy and into France.  This tercet thus
accomplishes a great deal, introducing and defending the concept of the
Holy Roman Empire in the space of three lines.

	|97-111.~  Having finished with the "Roman" past of imperial power,
from Julius to Charlemagne, a period of just over 800 years, Justinian
now turns to the present political ills of Italy.  This subject is not
treated as formally as the history of Roman institutions, but it is at
once clear that, for Dante, it is of extraordinary importance

	|97-99.~  For Justinian's earlier references to Guelphs and Ghibellines
and their battle over control of the ^sacrosanto segno~ (that most holy
standard), see vv. 31-33 and the notes to those verses and to verse 30.
 In a real sense, then, vv. 34-96 ^are~ a digression (they are referred
to as a ^giunta~ [an addendum], at verse 30), only preparing for
Dante's pressing business, to show how poorly ordered the political
affairs of the peninsula were in his own time.

	|100-102.~  While the Guelphs oppose the imperial ensign with their
(French) golden lilies, the Ghibellines try to make it only their own,
desiring to deprive others of their rightful imperial homeland.

	|103-105.~  The Ghibellines, for ridding the sacred sign of empire of
justice, are told to find another symbol to represent their conniving
spirit.

	|106-108.~  Charles II, King of Naples (ruled 1289-1309), is referred
to as "new" to distinguish him from his father, also King of Naples
(and Sicily, in his case), who died in 1285.  Justinian warns him not
to let his Guelph troops attempt to wrest the ensign of imperial
rulership from the Ghibellines (who have their own problems in meriting
it), for the empire has defeated mightier enemies before.

	|108.~  The imperial eagle's claws are portrayed as having "ripped the
hides from greater lions" than Charles represents.  The general sense
is clear, but there have been any number of interpretations of what
exactly is meant.  E.g., the author of the ^Chiose ambrosiane~ (comm.
to this verse) suggests defeated opponents of the eagle enumerated in
the preceding text, such as Hannibal, Brennus, Turnus, etc.; Benvenuto
(comm. to vv. 100-111) goes off into Roman history for still others who
lost battles to the forces of ancient Rome; Trifon Gabriele (comm. to
this verse) says that where the eagle is the symbol of empire, the lion
is that of republics; Andreoli (comm. to this verse): the lion is the
symbol of the ruling house of France; Bianchi (comm. to vv. 106-108):
the "hides" indicate other princes; Pietrobono (comm. to vv. 107-108):
enemies of Rome as indicated in ^Monarchia~ II.viii.  The majority
believes that there is no specific reference, only a generic prophecy
of Charles' doomed experiment with increasing his dominions, should he
try to accomplish that.

	|109-110.~  Strangely enough, not a single commentator (at least not
among the seventy-two currently gathered in the DDP) makes reference to
Ugolino's narrative here (see, e.g., ^Inf~. XXXIII.38-39).  In this
poem there is hardly another more evident case of sons weeping for the
sins of their father.

	|112-117.~  In these two tercets Justinian explains the nature of what
was lacking in these souls (as Frank Ordiway has pointed out ["In the
Earth's Shadow: The Theological Virtues Marred," ^Dante Studies~ 100
{1982}: 82-85], it is the theological virtue of hope in its perfected
form).  As the temporary Moon-dwellers displayed a marred version of
faith, so Justinian and the others here, while they were alive,
displayed hope in an immature form, rendering their love of God less
vibrant than it should have been.

	|118-123.~  In the following pair of tercets (these twelve verses
indeed form a group, the two equal parts of which are joined by a
triumphant "But"), Justinian, as has frequently been noted, sounds very
much like Piccarda (^Par~. III.70-87).  We can safely assume that
neither he nor Romeo would be among the higher petals of the Rose in
^Paradiso~ XXXII; but that only makes them love God the more, for
accepting them in Heaven with a history of such galling imperfections.

	|121.~  This verse marks the third occurrence of the noun ^giustizia~
in the canto, a density shared by only two previous cantos (^Inf~. III
and ^Purg~. XIX; however, see ^Par~. VII, where that noun appears only
once, but other forms of the word [^giusta~ (3), ^giustamente~ (2),
^giuste~] appear six times; see the note to ^Par~. VII.20).

	|127-142.~  Romeo, seneschal (chief steward) of Raymond Berenger IV,
count of Provence: "The only foundation, apparently, for the story,
adopted by Dante and Villani (vi.90), of the 'pilgrim' who became the
minister of the Proven$cal count, is the fact that the name of count
Berenger's grand seneschal was Romieu (or Rom$ee) of Villeneuve.
Romeo, a friend of Sordello (^Purg~. VI.74) was born c. 1170.  In Aug.
1229 he was in Genoa as ambassador to the ^podest@a~ of that city, and
in the same year was serving as Raymond Berenger's chief minister, and
by him was granted certain possessions in Genoa and her territories,
and the next year received other properties.  Early in 1241, on another
mission as ambassador, he became involved in a battle at sea, from
which he escaped unscathed, even managing to capture a Pisan vessel
laden with merchandise which he had taken to Nice.  On Aug. 19, 1245
Raymond Berenger died, leaving his daughter Beatrice his heir, and
Romeo as 'baiulus totius terrae suae et filiae suae' [guardian of all
his lands and those of his daughter].  Beatrice then married Charles of
Anjou while under Romeo's guardianship.  Romeo died in 1250" (Toynbee,
"Romeo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

For Villani's account (in English) of the arrangements made by Romeo to
marry off Raymond's daughters and his umbrage at Raymond's request for
an accountancy, see Oelsner's comment on these lines.

	|127.~  As Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ ([glosses to the ^Paradiso~],
^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001, p. 28),
is alone in pointing out, Justinian's reference to the planet Mercury
as a pearl (as the narrator had referred to the Moon in ^Par~. II.34)
possibly has a biblical resonance: see Matthew 13.44-46, comparing the
kingdom of heaven to "a pearl of great price."

	|130-132.~  Those courtiers, we suppose, who spoke ill of Romeo to
Raymond, succeeded in forcing his removal from a position of trust (see
vv. 136-139), but in the end suffered the tyrannical rule of Raymond's
successors.

	|134.~  When we read or hear Raymond's name, we may reflect on how many
names or references to historical figures we have encountered in this
canto (all but two of them in the first 106 verses).  The total
(Constantine, Aeneas, Lavinia, Justinian, Agapetus, Belisarius, Pallas,
the Curiatii, the Horatii, the seven first kings of Rome, Sabine women,
Lucrece, unnamed republicans, Brennus, Pyrrhus, Torquatus, Cincinnatus,
the Decii, the Fabii, Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Pompey, Julius
Caesar, Hector, Ptolemy, Juba, Augustus, Brutus, Cassius, Mark Antony,
Cleopatra, Tiberius, Titus, Desiderius, Charlemagne, Charles II of
Anjou, Romeo, and Raymond), even if we count some plural presences as
single units, as here, is an impressive 38, and that excludes the
several-times-alluded-to Guelphs and Ghibellines.  If we have bought
into the discredited but still supported notion that in the last
^cantica~ Dante has given over worldly concerns, it may come as
something of a surprise to have a canto in ^Paradiso~ make so obvious a
gesture toward history.

	|137.~  The phrase ^dimandar ragione~ is a term used for requesting a
review of the financial situation between involved parties.

	|138.~  That is, Romeo's accounts always returned more than he had
accepted into his care.  The numbers seem merely casually chosen, but
would indicate a healthy 20% gain in Raymond's holdings under Romeo's
management.  But see Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the
^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001), p. 30), arguing for the non-coincidental appearance of these two
numbers in ^Paradiso~ XIX.91-93, the "cinque volte sette" (five times
seven) as the expression for the thirty-five letters that compose the
first sentence of the Book of Wisdom.

	|139-142.~  Where the opening verses of the canto imply the presence of
Virgil, as author of the ^Aeneid~, the concluding ones summon the image
of the exiled and "mendicant" Dante (cf. ^Par~. XVII.58-60,
Cacciaguida's admonition: "You shall learn how salt is the taste / of
another man's bread and how hard it is / to go down and then up another
man's stairs").  See Mazzoni ("Il canto VI del ^Paradiso~," ^Letture
classensi~ 9-10 [1982]: 157); and see Woodhouse ("Dante and Governance:
Contexts and Contents," in ^Dante and Governance~, ed. John Woodhouse
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1997], pp. 1-11) for a treatment in English of
Romeo's resemblance to Dante: It is he who, "by recalling, in his
person and in his name, ^Romeus~, pilgrim to Rome, recalls the tragic
figure of Dante himself" (p. 7).  His name also binds the two seemingly
disparate parts of the canto, ancient and modern.  This is a "Roman
canto," even when it turns its attention to recent events in Provence;
its first part is a sort of vernacular version of a theologized
^Aeneid~; its last, a comic (i.e., happily resolved) version of a
lament for a courtier.
