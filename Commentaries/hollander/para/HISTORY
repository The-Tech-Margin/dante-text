Received canto 1 from Bob Hollander. Processed and loaded. This canto contains the first
instance I know of of an "n" with tilde. I entered the character as its ISO-8859-1 encoding
via the "Special Characters..." menu on the Mac's Terminal utility. It appears correct when
displayed by the browsers.
