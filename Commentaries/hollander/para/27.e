	|1-3.~  In celebration of the completion of Adam's "education" of Dante
in the eighth sphere, where Dante spends six hours (see ^Par~.
XXII.152, XXVII.79-81, and cf. Adam's six hours in Eden) and six
cantos, the longest time spent in any sphere, the entire consistory of
heaven, first seen in ^Paradiso~ XXIII.19-33 and 82-139, now sings the
^Gloria~ to the Trinity.  Bosco/Reggio point out that the poem contains
the "great prayers" of the Church: ^Paternoster~ (^Purg~. XI.1-24),
^Credo~ (^Par~. XXIV.130-41), ^Ave Maria~ (^Par~. XXXIII.1-21), ^Te
Deum~ (^Purg~. IX.139-41; ^Par~. XXIV.112-14), and ^Sanctus~ (^Par~.
XXVI.69).  Here once again the souls sing in Italian.  It seems
possible that the blessed and the angels use Latin when they sing to
one another and that, when they sing of Dante, their language is
Italian.  For the songs heard in this canticle, see the note to
^Paradiso~ XXI.58-60.

Daniello (comm. to vv. 1-6) points out that the ^Gloria~ was sung in
church after the congregation sang a hymn.

For Dante's "drunkenness" see Jeremiah 23:9, "quasi vir ebrius" (like a
man who is drunk); but see also, as Bosco/Reggio cite Consoli as
noting, ^Vita nuova~ III.2, where Dante, upon first hearing Beatrice's
voice, was taken by "tanta dolcezza, che come inebriato mi partio da le
genti" (became so ecstatic that, like a drunken man, I turned away from
everyone [tr. M. Musa]).  He has come full circle.

	|4-6.~  Insisting on his "drunkenness," the poet now says that to the
first cause (the singing) was added a second inebriant, what seemed to
him no less than a smile of universal proportion.

	|7-9.~  The five conditions apostrophized by the poet (happiness, joy,
love, peace, riches) are all usually associated with life in this
world.  Here they are all rather imagined in their transmuted spiritual
forms.

	|9.~  The word ^brama~ occurs six times in the poem and is always
associated with a low longing, especially for wealth; in fact, it is
twice associated with wolves (^Inf~. I.49; ^Par~. IV.4).  Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to verse 9) cite ^Convivio~ III.xv.3: "[il desiderio] essere non
pu@o con la beatitudine, acci@o che la beatitudine sia perfetta cosa e
lo desiderio sia cosa defettiva" (desire is something that cannot
coexist with blessedness, since blessedness is something perfect and
desire something defective -- tr. R. Lansing).

	|10-15.~  Peter, about to reenter the action as the ^primus inter
pares~ yet again, has his flame turn from white to red.  The
pseudo-simile has it that Peter went from white to red as would Jupiter
were he to exchange plumage with Mars; against those who find the
figure of speech "strange" or "forced," Chiavacci Leonardi (^Paradiso,
con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1997], p. 743)
points out that an ancient tradition of representation presented the
planets as birds, with rays as their feathers.  John Scott, in his
essay "Su alcune immagini tematiche di ^Paradiso~ XXVII" (^Dante
magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1977], pp.
195-237), demonstrates the precision of Dante's apparently forced
figure: The just God (Jove) will demonstrate His justness by righteous
indignation (i.e., Mars-like -- pp. 196-202).

	|16-18.~  Tozer (comm. to vv. 16-17) explains the reference as being to
that aspect of Providence "'which in Heaven assigns to each his fitting
time and part'; ^vice~ is the occasion when this or that person is to
act, ^offizio~ the function which he is to perform.  For the general
principle which is here expressed, cp. ^Par~. XXI.67-72" [i.e., Peter
Damian expressing his subservience to God in accepting his mission to
Dante].

	|19-21.~  Peter looks ahead to the transmogrification of every member
of the Church Triumphant, reddening with righteous anger, when he
unleashes his harsh words.  Significantly enough, this is treated as
occurring only after his reference to Satan in verse 27.

	|22-24.~  Despite Peter's vehemence about Rome's centrality to the
papacy, it is good to keep in mind the observation of V.H.H. Green
(cited by Scott ["Genesi e sviluppo del pensiero politico di Dante,"
in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario dantesco
internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ {Florence: Cesati,
2004}, p. 253n.]) that between 1100 and 1304 (and we should be aware of
Dante's insistence on the rightness of their being there), the popes
were more absent from Rome than present, 122 years vs. 82 years.
Further, for Dante, Boniface was both a bad pope and an improperly
elected one.  On either (or both) of those grounds, he may have
considered the Papal See "vacant" in 1300, and thus felt he could
represent Satan's particular pleasure in Boniface's improper
stewardship.  However, it seems likely that the passage is also meant
to reflect the scandalously long period between the death of Bertrand
de Got, Pope Clement V (20 April 1314) and the election of yet another
Frenchman, Jacques d'Euse, as Pope John XXII (5 September 1316).  On
the other hand, it also seems probable that, to Dante's eyes, if
Boniface had left the papacy "vacant" because of his various
shortcomings, both of his successors, one having moved the papacy to
France and the other having kept it there, had left its true seat, in
Rome, vacant.  (Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 10-27] is of a somewhat
different opinion, believing that Dante considered the Papal See
"vacant" when John XXII, a simoniac pope if ever there were one, ruled
the Church; half a dozen more recent commentators are also of this
opinion.)

Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 22-24) was apparently the first to point out
that the repeated phrase "il luogo mio" recapitulates Jeremiah 7:4, the
thrice-repeated "templum Domini" (the Lord's temple).  He is seconded
by a number of other commentators between Poletto and Fallani, but then
the commentaries go silent on this ascription.  More recently, Rachel
Jacoff ("Dante, Geremia e la problematica profetica," in ^Dante e la
Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki, 1988], pp. 114-115) repeats
this citation, apparently without realizing that she does so.

Peter's triple repetition, not quite unique in the poem (see the
^santo, santo, santo~ of ^Par~. XXVI.69), is nonetheless notable,
perhaps reminding the reader of the Trinity as well as of the
triple-tiered tiara worn by the pope.

	|25-27.~  For a discussion of this penultimate, if intrinsic, assault
on Boniface, see Massimo Seriacopi (^Bonifacio VIII nella storia e
nell'opera di Dante~ [Florence: Chiari, 2003]), pp. 220-25).  The
author goes on to describe Dante's general attitude toward this great
figure in the history of the papacy as follows: "[Boniface is to Dante]
at once the pope and a simoniac; magnificent and yet obtuse; full of
energy but arrogant" (p. 226).  His book concludes with a helpful
review of the varying views of Boniface, found in Dante's margins, put
forward by the fourteenth-century commentators (pp. 239-57).  For a
papal attempt (that of Benedict XV in 1921) to square Dante's poem with
the Church's teaching, see Maria Lorena Burlot ("Dante Alighieri y la
Iglesia cat$olica.  La ^Divina Comedia~ y la Enciclica 'In praeclara'
de Benedicto XV," in ^Mito y religi$on en la lengua y la literatura
italianas: Atti del convegno di italianistica~, ed. Gloria Galli de
Ortega y Mar$ia Troiano de Echegaray, Vol. II [Mendoza: Editorial de la
Facultad de Filosof$ia y Letras - Univ. Nac. de Cuyo, 2003], p. 551).
Benedict is able to discover a Trinitarian reference even in Dante's
condemnation of three popes (Celestine V, Boniface VIII, and Clement
V).  This is to neglect the fact that several other popes are
specifically referred to as being condemned to Hell for eternity (see
the note to ^Inf~. VII.46-48).  (Anyone defending the notion of papal
infallibility will probably need to argue for exemptions for popes with
literary aspirations.  See also Benedict's attempt to find still
another "trinitarian" compositional block in the 14,200 verses of the
poem, an especially dubious notion in light of the fact that the poem
contains 14,233 verses.)

	|28-30.~  This detail is drawn from Ovid (^Metam~. III.183-185):
Diana's blush as seen by Actaeon.  (See Grandgent [comm. to verse 28].)
 Ovid's phrase ^adversi solis~ is pretty obviously recalled in Dante's
^lo sole avverso~.  That blush fits the context of the blush of shame
attributed to Beatrice in verse 34.

	|31-36.~  Alessandro D'Ancona (^Scritti danteschi~ [Forence: Sansoni,
1913], p. 460) was among the first to insist (see Steiner [comm. to vv.
31-34], in disagreement) that Beatrice went pale, that is, did not grow
red with indignation.  (But see Poletto's [comm. to vv. 31-34] earlier
report of Giuliani's still earlier and similar interpretation, which
he, similarly, does not accept.)  This view has, nonetheless, been
followed by a number of twentieth-century Dantists.  But see Scott
(^Dante magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1977],
p. 209) for a rebuke of those who so argue.  And see Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to vv. 28-36) for a view similar to his; however, they go on to
argue that the reference to the eclipse at Christ's Passion (see
Matthew 27:45) reflects not only her darkening, but that of all the
saints of the Church Triumphant temporarily gathered here.

	|33.~  What probably makes the passage more difficult than it really
should be is the adjective ^timido~, understood by the early
commentators as "ashamed" (a word readily associated with blushing),
while modern ones think it means "timid" (an adjective more likely
associated with facial pallor).  The last seems a less likely
significance, given the context.

	|37-39.~  Peter's voice (vv. 19-27) was, we may be surprised to learn,
not as angry in that utterance as it is soon to be.  When we read back
over the passage (vv. 19-39), we realize that the poet has carefully
staged the development of this scene: (1) preparation for the change in
color (vv. 19-21); (2) the occurrence of that change (vv. 28-36); (3)
the further change in the quality of Peter's voice (vv. 37-39).  Cf.
Dante's own two-stage "drunkenness" in vv. 1-6, first at a sound, then
at a sight.  Here Peter modulates his appearance first, and then his
voice.

	|40-45.~  Peter begins a list of some martyred popes with himself; he
refers to or names six others in all.  These may be broken down into
three pairs, one from each of the first three centuries of the Church's
life (Linus and Cletus, Sixtus and Pius, Calixtus and Urban).

	|46-48.~  Christ will come in judgment and divide his flock into sheep
(those who are saved) and goats (those eternally damned).  The sitting
pope (in 1300, Boniface VIII) is charged with dividing his people into
two political factions, the Guelphs loyal to him (his sheep) and his
Ghibelline enemies (the goats).  This does not mean that Dante limited
his list of papal offenders in this respect to one.

	|49-51.~  The first four of Peter's complaints (vv. 40-54) about papal
misconduct seem both generalizable and yet specific to Boniface's reign
(1294-1303).  The papacy was often portrayed by Dante as using its
temporal power incorrectly; this passage may particularly remember
Boniface's "crusade" against the Colonna family, already alluded to in
^Inferno~ XXVII.85-90, as Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 49-54) was the first
to suggest.

	|52-54.~  This tercet reflects the sale of ecclesiastical privileges
which bore the papal seal, the image of St. Peter.

	|55-57.~  Now we descend to the lesser ranks of the clergy.  See
Matthew 7:15 for the warning against wolves in sheep's clothing,
applied to those priests who betray their calling (and their
parishioners).

See Marina Marietti ("L'agnello al centro," ^Letteratura italiana
antica~ 4 [2003]), pp. 435-40) for the way in which Dante considers
himself a descendant of the prophet Jeremiah here and throughout the
^Comedy~.  And see Sapegno (comm. to these verses) for a citation of
the prophet's outcry against those shepherds who harm their flocks
(Jeremiah 23:1).

	|58-60.~  Two French popes, the Gascon Clement V (1305-14 -- see the
note to ^Inf~. XIX.79-87) and John XXII (1316-34) of Cahors (for that
city's association with usury, see the note to ^Inf~. XI.46-51), will
attempt to gather wealth from the Church founded by the blood of the
first martyred popes, representing the good beginning that will have so
foul an end.

	|61-63.~  A first prophetic utterance, leading into the fuller prophecy
at the end of the canto (vv. 142-148): Providence, which sided with
Scipio (in 202 B.C. at the battle of Zama) to maintain Rome's glory in
the world (and it is clear that the text refers to imperial, and not
ecclesiastical, Rome), will soon act to set things straight, as Peter
^conceives~ (for the force of this verb, see the notes to ^Inf~.
II.7-9, ^Inf~. XXXII.1-9, and ^Purg~. XXIX.37-42).

For Dante's lofty sense of Scipio, see Hollander and Rossi ("Dante's
Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104 [1986], pp. 65-69).  For his
persistent presence in ^Convivio~ (IV.v), ^Monarchia~ (II.ix), and
^Commedia~ (^Inf~. XXXI, ^Purg~. XXIX, ^Par~. VI, and here), see the
table (in "Dante's Republican Treasury," p. 75), also listing the
various appearances of the dozen and a half republican heroes referred
to in Dante's works.

It is surely striking that, at the climax of his antipapal outburst, he
turns to a great political figure and not to a religious one.  For an
earlier and more developed presentation of this view, see Scott (^Dante
magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1977], pp.
216-20).  A similar political frame of reference may inform Beatrice's
prophecy of the ^fortuna~ (verse 145) at the end of the canto.

	|64-66.~  These are the last words spoken by any "character" in the
poem (excepting, of course, the protagonist and his guides, Beatrice
and Bernard).  Peter joins those who charge mortal Dante with his
prophetic task, Beatrice (^Purg~. XXXII.103-105; XXXIII.52-57) and
Cacciaguida (^Par~. XVII.124-142), thus making threefold the source of
the poet's authority to reveal his vision.  This represents his final
investiture in his role as God's prophet.

Peter's flat-out acknowledgment that Dante is here in his flesh finally
sets that question to rest.  See previous discussions in the notes to
^Paradiso~ I.73, II.37-45, and XXII.129.

	|67-72.~  The Sun is in Capricorn (the Goat) in late December and the
first two-thirds of January, when we earthlings may well witness
snowflakes falling downward through the air.  Just so did Dante see the
souls in whom the celestial Rose consists making their way back up (and
thus through the Primum Mobile) to the Empyrean.  This is not, as we
may first think, a reversal of gravity.  The celestial pull is the
obverse of the terrestrial one, upward toward God.  They are snowing
themselves back home.  They have been away since ^Paradiso~ XXIII.19,
more than five hundred verses in five cantos, and for roughly the same
six hours that Dante has spent here.

Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 67-68) was apparently the first to cite as
"source" the upside-down "rain of manna" of angels returning to Heaven
in ^Vita nuova~ XXIII.25, in the ^canzone~ "Donna pietosa e di novella
etate."  The context of that central poem (sixteenth of thirty-one
poems in all, second of three ^canzoni~) is, however, the opposite of
this passage, for in it Dante imagines the death of Beatrice, and does
so in human, tragic terms.  Here, Beatrice is very much alive, watching
as her companions in beatitude joyfully return to their immortal
stations.

It seems extraordinary that ^leggere Dante con Dante~ ("reading Dante
through the lens of Dante," in a free translation), as Scartazzini is
doing here, took so long to establish itself as a critical method.
There is very little reference to other ^loci~ in the ^Commedia~ (and
hardly any to Dante's other works) in the first five hundred years of
the poem's life among its commentators.  And, in a related phenomenon,
there is hardly any citation of the poet's "competitors" in vernacular
lyric; the major sources of literary reference are the Bible and the
Latin classics.  Today, readers take all of these as necessary and
useful avenues for exploring the poem.  See, for example, Emilio
Pasquini, "Fra Dante e Guido: la neve e i suoi segreti" (in ^Dante e le
figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori,
2001], pp. 66-67), discussing the Cavalcantian elements of this simile.

	|70.~  Standing at either end of this heaven is a reference to it as
"aether" ^(etera)~, the denser-than-air substance of the planetary
spheres (see the note to ^Par~. XXII.132).

	|71.~  The adjective attached to these souls ^(tr,iunfanti)~ is both
descriptive and designative, the latter insofar as they are members of
the Church Triumphant - in case we had forgot.

	|73-75.~  The space is that between the Starry Sphere and the Empyrean
(i.e., situated above the Crystalline Sphere), and thus defeats Dante's
ability to see them return.

	|76-78.~  Beatrice, seeing that Dante can no longer make out the
members of the Church Triumphant as they return home, invites him, once
again, to look beneath his feet, down through the universe, toward the
earth (see ^Par~. XXII.127-129).

	|79-87.~  The formally similar beginnings and conclusions of the two
passages (this one and ^Par~. XXII.133-153) devoted to the
protagonist's earthward gazing back down through the heavens underline
the formulaic aspect of both scenes.  See Moore (^Studies in Dante~,
Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 {1903}],
pp. 62-71) for a full discussion.

Dante's reference points are noteworthy: He is over the trackless ocean
to the west of the two islands referred to as Gades (^Insulae Gades~
[see the note to verse 82]) where Ulysses began his ^folle volo~
(^Inf~. XXVI.125) and can almost see the shore of Asia Minor, where
Europa was raped by Jupiter.  Some suggest that these two myths reflect
the two most insistent temptations of man, prideful or transgressive
intellectual behavior and lust.  It may also be tempting to see them in
autobiographical terms for Dante, his besetting sins of wayward
philosophizing and sexual misconduct, these two sins finding an echo
(and a model?) in St. Augustine's ^Confessions~ (see Hollander
[^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ {Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1969}], p. 165n.).  The importance of the double classical
reference is underlined when we consider that we have not read an overt
reference to a classical myth since the one to Semele in ^Paradiso~
XXI.6 that none such has been allowed in this heaven of the fixed
stars, with its "characters" all drawn from their ranks in the Church
Triumphant, surmounted by the three apostles and Adam.  To round off
this moment, the last in the Starry Sphere, Dante picks up two words or
phrases from the similar vision in ^Paradiso~ XXII.151 and XXII.129:
^aiuola~ and ^sotto i [miei] piedi.~

As Jacoff points out ("The Rape/Rapture of Europa: ^Paradiso~ 27," in
Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion:
Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University
Press, 1991], p. 237), Ovid tells the story of Europa in three
different places (^Metamorphoses~ II and VI; ^Fasti~ II) with quite
diverse treatments; she meditates upon the possibility that Dante has
at once paired Europa with Ulysses ^in malo~, as transgressive voyager
(even if she is a victim of Jove's lustful forcing), and also ^in
bono~, as a sort of classical prefiguration of Dante, in that she was
conjoined with the divine.  On this passage, see Christian Moevs (^The
Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2005], pp. 132-33), arguing that Ulysses and Europa have opposed
valuations, he being identified with selfish seeking, while she
represents "loving surrender to the divine."  For expression of the
more usual view, see Scott (^Dante magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~
[Florence: Olschki, 1977], p. 223), finding in Ulysses a man who fell
victim to the temptations of the intellect and the will, while seeing
in Europa a victim of her own sensual desires.  However, it might be
objected that Europa is not the character who is paired with Ulysses,
but that Jove is.  That is, Ulysses and Jupiter are both portrayed as
embarking on voyages, spurred by curiosity in the first case and by
lust in the second, that are harmful to their "mates."

	|79-81.~  How long was Dante away from our terrestrial globe?  In
Carroll's words (comm. to ^Par~. XXII.151-154), this is "one of the
most difficult problems in the poem."  But then Carroll himself
neglects the question of how long Dante actually remained in the
heavens.  Even the usually more exigent Moore (^The Time-References in
the "Divina Commedia"~ [London: David Nutt, 1887], pp. 58-59, 126-27)
rather casually allows the traveler (as do many other Dantists) one
entire day in Paradise, as measured by a "clock" down here on earth (p.
59).  The result is that the hours he was aloft round off the entire
journey at precisely seven days (Thursday 6 pm to Thursday 6 pm).  (In
fact, most Dantists today are likely to insist that such a calendar
would require that we understand that the poet was in the heavens
thirty hours, from noon Wednesday to Thursday evening.)  While there is
no reason to think that this calculation is incorrect, there is also no
evidence in the poem that would corroborate this perfectly
understandable desire to add a detail (and it is indeed a thoroughly
Dantesque detail) to what the poet left us.  The fact is that, for
whatever reason, he either never got round to working this calculation
out or deliberately avoided engagement with it.

If, however, we limit our inquiry to how long he was in ^this~ heaven,
we can establish that period from the celestial details we are given
here (see, e.g., Moore [^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous
Essays~ {Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 [1903]}, p. 68]): Six hours have passed
since the protagonist last looked down (at the conclusion of ^Par~. XXII).
And see the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVI.139-142, pointing out that Dante
spends six hours in the Starry Sphere, as did Adam in Eden. (This is not
to mention that [all but two] members of the Church Triumphant were also
present here for that amount of time [see the note to vv. 67-72]).

See Tozer's clarifying paraphrase of this passage (comm to this
tercet): "'I saw that I had passed along the whole of the arc which the
first clime forms from its middle point to its end.'  This means that
Dante had moved through 90+o~ of longitude, from the meridian of
Jerusalem -- which place was the central point of the habitable world
of 180+o~ in length reckoned from E. to W. -- to that of Gades, which
marked its western limit.  In order to understand the terms in which
Dante has expressed this, we must first examine the meaning of the word
^clima~.  The ^climata~ of the Greek geographers were belts or spaces
of the earth's surface which intervened between two parallels of
latitude; and by Hipparchus, who first invented the term, these
intervals were measured by degrees of latitude; but Ptolemy, who
subsequently adopted it, determined them by the increase of the length
of the longest day, proceeding northwards from the equator to the
parallel of Thule, and dividing the intervening space into 21
^climata~.  Alfraganus, who is Dante's authority in this matter,
adapted the scheme of Ptolemy to his own purposes, and reduced the
number of ^climata~ to seven, commencing the computation, not from the
equator, but from Lat. 12+o~ 45' N., which was to him the limit of the
habitable globe to the south (Alfr., ^Element. Astronom~., cap. x).
The first of these ^climata~, the central parallel of which passed
through Mero,e, was the only one which lay wholly within the tropics,
and this is the reason why it is mentioned here, because the position
of Dante at this time was immediately over the northern half of the
torrid zone.  For Gemini, in which he now was, is one of the signs of
the zodiac; and as the sun never passes to the northward of the tropic
of Cancer, the signs of the zodiac, through which his course lies, must
fall within the same limit.  Hence Dante, in describing himself as
passing, while he was in Gemini, from the meridian of Jerusalem to that
of Gades, says that he moved along the arc formed by the ^primo~
^clima~.  The interval between those two points is represented as
reaching from the middle to the end of the first ^clima~, because to
Alfraganus the ^climata~ were divisions not of the entire globe, but of
the habitable globe (thus he says 'Loca quadrantis ^habitabilis~
dividuntur in septem climata'), and he regarded their extension from E.
to W. as corresponding to twelve hours in time ('longitudo omnium
climatum ab oriente in occasum spatio 12 horarum a revolutione caelesti
conficitur'), which represent 180+o~ in space.  Consequently, the half
of this extension (^dal mezzo al fine~) would be six hours in time, or
90+o~ in space, thus corresponding to the difference between Jerusalem
and Gades.  ^Fine~ is appropriately used of the western extremity of
the ^clima~, because the movement of the sun, and that of Dante himself
in the zodiac, which are here regarded, are from E. to W.  It is hardly
necessary to add that, when it is said that Dante was on the meridian
of Jerusalem or of Gades, it does not follow that he was over those
places, but only that he was in the same longitude with them."

	|82.~  See Victoria Kirkham ("Dante's Polysynchrony: a Perfectly Timed
Entry into Eden," ^Filologia e critica~ 20 [1995], p. 347n.) on "Gade":
"Dante's 'Gades' refers not to Cadiz, but to the ^Gades Insulae~
described by Paulus Orosius, the foundations upon which Hercules built
his pillars, marking the outermost limit of the western world.  See for
this clarification M. A. Orr, ^Dante and the Early Astronomers~
(London: Wingate, 1913), p. 222."

Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della
"Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001] makes an interesting
observation [pp. 265-67]): Petrarch, in a letter to Boccaccio of 1359,
fairly obviously appropriates Dante's presentation of Ulysses (^Inf~.
XXVI.94-99) in order to portray the poet himself, seen as lacking in
loyalty to the family he left behind in Florence.

	|83.~  Ulysses reappears once more.  Again he figures a voyage quite
different from Dante's, a voyage to destruction.  Those who attempt to
read the central character of ^Inferno~ XXVI as positive here must deal
with Dante's firm rejection of the hero, which surely makes it even
more difficult to heroicize him than did the ironic treatment offered
in the earlier episode.  See, in a similar vein, Picone ("Canto
XXVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 430).  However,
see Ruedi Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les la,ics~ [Fribourg:
Editions Universitaires, 1996]) for an essay, "Ulysse, figure de
philosophe" (pp. 215-45).  This rehashes the varied classical and
medieval sources (pp. 215-29) and by and large tries to associate
itself with the earlier Romantic reading of Mario Fubini ("Il peccato
d'Ulisse" and "Il canto XXVI dell'^Inferno~," in his ^Il peccato
d'Ulisse e altri scritti danteschi~ [Milan: Ricciardi, 1966], pp. 1-76).

	|86.~  It is nearly certainly hazardous to translate ^aiuola~ (little
patch of earth) as "threshing-floor"; see the note to ^Paradiso~
XXII.151.  Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle ("Closure in Paradise: Dante
Outsings Aquinas," ^Modern Language Notes~ 115 [2000]: 1-12) is among
the many who simply assume that it is what is meant by the word.

For the twin problems, exactly how far Dante had moved with the heavens
and, consequently, how much of our globe he was able to observe, see
Carroll (comm. to ^Par~. XXII.151-154).  His hypothesis is that the
reader is supposed to identify each of the three apostles with whom
Dante has conversed as having been particularly identified with efforts
located in specific parts of the Mediterranean world, John with Asia
Minor, Peter with Rome, and James with Spain.  And thus, with regard to
the second question, the protagonist's vision of earth coincides with
those regions.

	|85-87.~  This tercet repeats two distinctive elements we found at the
arrival in the Starry Sphere: The poet again (see ^Par~. XXII.151)
refers to the little globe below as the "small patch of earth" that it
seems ^(aiuola)~ and the protagonist again (^Par~. XXII.129) sees it
beneath his feet ^(sotto li piedi)~ -- see the appended note concerning
the possibility that we are supposed to conclude that those feet make
the protagonist present in his body.  When we read the phrase now,
however, it is difficult to come to any other conclusion, since Peter
has already (see verse 64) referred to Dante's "mortal burden" -- with
him now, his flesh.

	|88-99.~  Only the last of these four tercets allotted to the ascent to
the next heaven, the Crystalline Sphere, is devoted to the ascent
itself.  Once again, Beatrice has become unspeakably more beautiful,
outdoing either natural beauty or artistic rendering.  With his eyes
fixed on hers, Dante moves up to the next realm.  The passage includes,
perhaps surprisingly, a reference to Beatrice's ^physical~ beauty (vv.
91-93).  We are close enough to the Empyrean for that to come as a
surprise, even as a shock.  However, when we examine the text, we find
that the poet tells us that such carnally delightful images would be
nothing compared to her beauty as a reflection of God's divinity.

	|98.~  Her eyes draw him aloft out of Gemini, the "nest of Leda," a
reference that may have been chosen to remind us of Jupiter, seducer of
Europa (verse 84) and Leda, among others.

	|100-102.~  The Crystalline Sphere is uniform and transparent.  Those
of us who have been hoping to have confirmation that somehow the
specifications made in ^Convivio~ about the intellectual activities
sponsored by the various heavens, as these are described there, might
seem reflected in these same heavens, as they are described here, must
once again suffer disappointment, as the Primum Mobile, according to
^Convivio~ (II.xiv.14-18), is supposed to resemble moral philosophy --
not angelology.  It certainly seems plain that Dante abandoned this
schematic design of the earlier work in the ^Comedy~, for whatever
reason.  But see Peter Armour ("^Paradiso~ XXVII," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1995], p. 410), claiming that Beatrice's
turning to invective is indeed the sign of this heaven's alignment with
moral philosophy.

We may expect a simile to begin our experience of the new realm, as has
been frequently the case (see ^Par~. V.100-105; ^Par~. VIII.16-21;
^Par~. XIV.97-102; ^Par~. XVIII.73-77; ^Par~. XXI.34-42), but do not
find one.

	|100.~  There is considerable contention about the possible reading
^vicissime~ (nearest), defended vigorously and even nastily by
Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 100-102).  Petrocchi (^Dante Alighieri: La
Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, ed. G. Petrocchi [Florence: Le
Lettere, 1994 {1966}], vol. I, Introduzione), pp. 245-47, defends his
choice of ^vivissime~.  As always, whatever our opinion, we have
followed Petrocchi, who argues that it here means "moving most
quickly."  There are a number of other candidates, as sketched by
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 100-102).

	|103.~  Beatrice, reading Dante's mind, knows that he wants to find out
exactly where he is.

	|106-114.~  These verses make clear the relationship of this sphere to
the Empyrean, which, without having any recognizable shape at all, is
like a tenth celestial circle, if only in that it "surrounds" the
Primum Mobile.

	|107.~  The word ^mezzo~, which also can have a quite different
technical meaning (e.g., at ^Purg~. I.15), here apparently means
"midpoint" or "center," indicating the earth as the center of the material
universe.

	|109.~  For the notion that Dante's universe is four-dimensional, a
hypersphere, see Mark Peterson ("Dante and the 3-sphere," ^American
Journal of Physics~ 47.12 [1979]: 1031-35), who believes that Dante's
vision of the cosmos looks forward to Einstein's; Robert Osserman
(^Poetry of the Universe~ [New York: Anchor, 1995], pp. 89-91),
suggesting that Peterson overlooks the earlier model proposed by
Riemann; John Freccero ("Dante's Cosmos" [Bernardo Lecture Series, No.
6; Binghamton, N.Y.: CEMERS, 1998], pp. 1-16); and William Egginton
("On Dante, Hyperspheres, and the Curvature of the Medieval Cosmos,"
^Journal of the History of Ideas~ 60.2 [1999]: 195-216).  However, the
reader probably should temper an enthusiasm for such "premodern
physics" on Dante's part with an awareness of his possible dependence,
for his "ontological, neoplatonic, and theocentric" vision of the rest
of the universe, on such models as he found in his precursors.  For
instance, see Marguerite Mills Chiarenza ("'Legato con amore in un
volume,'" in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki,
1988], pp. 232-34), reacting to ^Paradiso~ XXVIII.14-15 with the
suggestion that Dante's "picture" derives from Bonaventure
(^Itinerarium mentis~, V).

For a quick introduction to the properties of the hypersphere, one may
visit the following site:
\<a href=\"\"http://www.hypersphere.com/hs/abouths.html\"\"\>http://www.hypersphere.com/hs/abouths.html\</a\>.

	|115-120.~  The Crystalline Sphere rules the temporal
relationships among the parts of the rest of the universe.  Dante employs
the word ^testo~ ("flowerpot"), a hapax when having this sense (but see
^Inf~. XV.89 and ^Purg~. VI.29 for its use with the meaning "text") to
portray the ninth (and invisible) sphere as the container of all time,
with its invisible roots here, displaying its leaves, pushed downward, in
the visible portions of the rest of the spheres (the stars and planets).
(The Crystalline Sphere's "likeness" to a flowerpot would seem to be
based on the fact that we cannot see the "roots of time," just as we
cannot see the root system of a plant when it is in a pot.)

The author of the Codice Cassinese (comm. to verse 115) was perhaps the
first to point to Dante's source here, Aristotle's ^Physics~
(IV.x-xiii); Francesco Torraca (comm. to vv. 118-120) appears to have
been the first commentator to cite Dante's citation of that passage in
^Convivio~ (IV.ii.6).

	|121-126.~  Ever since the protagonist encountered the wolf of
cupidity in the first canto, ^cupidigia~ has been a constant presence
in the poem.  It now becomes, in metaphor, the flood that covers all
humankind and stifles efforts toward noble enterprise. Since we naturally
long for the good, it is the blight of cupidity that turns our first
flowering into rotten fruit.

	|126.~  Casini/Barbi (comm. to this verse, citing ^BSDI~ 9 [1902]: 161)
refer to the Tuscan saying (given here in a rough English version) that
offers the following meteorological pearl: "If it rains on Ascension
Day / the plums will suffer quick decay."

	|127.~  We follow Chimenz (comm. to vv. 127-129) and most recent
commentators in reading the word ^fede~ in the moral (rather than the
theological) sense, and thus "loyalty" or "honesty."

	|130-135.~  In these two examples of failing human conduct, does Dante
rehearse the first two sins of mankind, eating and killing?  An air of
puzzlement about the poet's reasons for choosing these particular
examples pervades the early commentaries.  John of Serravalle (comm. to
vv. 133-135) is among the few to offer a motive, in the second
instance, for such nasty thoughts on the part of the grown child,
putting in his mouth the following maledictive question: "When will she
be dead, this damned old lady?"  Baldassare Lombardi (comm. to vv.
134-135) suggests two motives: to be done with her pious corrections
and to dissipate her property.  This two-part motive is repeated by any
number of later commentators; Luigi Pietrobono (comm. to verse 135) is
the first of them to think of Cecco Angiolieri's sonnet "S'io fossi
fuoco" (If I were fire) in which he says, "S'i' fosse morte, andarei a
mi' padre; -- s'i' fosse vita, non starei con lui: -- similemente faria
da mi' madre" (If I were Death, I'd go to my father; if I were life, I
would not abide with him: and [I'd have] the same dealings with my
mother).

Gary Cestaro (^Dante and the Grammar of the Nursing Body~ [Notre Dame:
University of Notre Dame Press, 2003], pp. 80-82), dealing with the
intrinsic concern with the kind of vernacular Dante champions here,
believes that one finds in this passage a reversal of the disparaging
of the "unlettered vernacular" urged both in ^De vulgari eloquentia~
and in ^Convivio~.  He does so, however, in a heavy-handed a manner,
one based, as he himself insists (e.g., pp. 3-6) on the
post-psychoanalytic views of the determining effects of infancy put
forward by Julia Kristeva.  The result tends to turn Dante's work into
a single-purposed, compulsive deliberation about the sexually derived
status of his language.  We read, for example, that a central concern
of the ^Convivio~ is "an imaginative reconstruction of the scene of his
parents' coitus" (p. 77); that (on the same page) in ^De vulgari
eloquentia~ both "language and subject exist in a kind of
poststructuralist drift."  One does not want only to object that these
things simply are not so, but that Dante would have been wide-eyed in
amazement if he had heard them uttered.  The over-determination of
Cestaro's thesis is both evident and in particular disarray a few pages
later (pp. 73-74).  He is considering the text of Proverbs 1:8-10,
which runs, in part, as follows: "My son, hear the instruction of your
father, and forsake not the law of your mother....  My son, if sinners
will entice (^lactaverint)~ you, consent not to them."  And here is
Cestaro on this passage: "Jerome's choice of the verb ^lacto~ here to
convey luxurious enticement and seduction... provides spectacular
semantic testimony of the nurturing horror inherent in classical
language."  One would probably not be convinced of the truth of that
statement even if the first-conjugation Latin verb ^lacto, lactare~ had
anything to do with nursing, with giving milk, as does the verb of the
second conjugation, ^lacteo, lactere~, with which Cestaro has evidently
conflated it because of their identical stems.

	|130.~  The gerund ^balbuz,iendo~, used as participle (repeated in
verse 133), picks up the adjective ^balba~ (stammering) from
^Purgatorio~ XIX.7, the description of the foul seductress in Dante's
second Purgatorial dream.  There it contrasted with the false beauty
and eloquence that the dreaming protagonist lent her; here it is the
sign of innocence and immaturity that is preferable to mature and
calculated evildoing.

	|136-138.~  A widely debated tercet, one of the most vexed passages in
the entire poem.  And yet, at least at first glance and if we listen
only to its first interpreters, it seems easier to resolve than it has
in fact turned out to be.  The Ottimo, Benvenuto, and Landino,
obviously reflecting on the context of the preceding six verses, argue
that the ^bella figlia~ is human nature itself, "created" by the Sun
(the Ottimo refers us to ^Par~. XXII.116 for Dante's presentation of
the Sun as "father" of every mortal life).  Starting with John of
Serravalle (comm. to this tercet), who also believes that the reference
is to human nature, commentators refer to Aristotle's tag, "Homo et sol
generant hominem" (Man and the Sun generate men), found near the end of
the second section of the ^Physics~ (and quoted by Dante [^Mon~.
I.ix.1].)  This is then repeated by numerous later glossators.
Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet), as many now do, recalls ^Paradiso~
XXII.93: "del bianco fatto bruno" (how dark its white has turned) as a
precursor text in the poem.

What tends to be obscured in the conflicting studies of the tercet is
the difficulty in making out the literal sense of the phrase "nel primo
aspetto."  This phrase may be understood in at least three mutually
exclusive ways: the ^aspetto~ (1) belongs to the daughter (it is
probably located in the skin of her face, her "aspect," what she looks
like) and is darkened by the Sun; (2) belongs to the daughter and is
^her~ gaze; (3) is what is seen by the Sun, that is, is in ^his~ sight
(whatever the Sun represents, whether itself or God).  Since there is
no sure way of determining which of these possibilities governs, one
has to proceed "backward," arguing from the context to the meaning of
this phrase.

What may seem surprising today, in light of the wildly differing
responses that begin with Carmine Galanti (as reported by Poletto in
1894 [comm. to this tercet], he introduced Circe into the list of
"candidates") and continue into our own time, is the near unanimity of
the ancients.  Major exceptions are Jacopo della Lana (comm. to this
tercet), who interprets her as representing the Church; the Anonimo
Fiorentino (comm. to this tercet), who, in a variation, thinks that she
represents the priesthood.  (For passages in Bonaventura's ^Collationes
in Hexaemeron~ [XII and XXV] that portray the Church as ^filia solis~,
see Gian Luca Pierotti ["La ^filia solis~ di Bonaventura e i
cambiamenti di colore in ^Par~. XXVII," ^Lettere Italiane~ 33 {1981}:
216-21].)  On the other hand, and for something completely different,
see Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 121-138), who uniquely is of the
opinion that, reflecting her presence in ^Aeneid~ VI.142 (the next two
verses detail the plucking of the golden bough), she is Proserpina, or
the Moon.   The most complete summary of interpretations until 1921 is
found in Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 136) and is still useful, up to a
point, today.

See James E. Shaw ("'And the Evening and the Morning Were One Day,'
[^Paradiso~, XXVII, 136-138]," ^Modern Philology~ 18 [1921]: 569-90)
for a close study of the passage that has perhaps dubious result (the
"primo aspetto" is Lucifer's, and the present tense results from the
presence of Lucifer in the world today -- pp. 584-86) but nonetheless
presents a good deal of interesting material.  Peter Armour
("^Paradiso~ XXVII," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings
III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~,
16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995], pp.
411-14) reviews the various theories without choosing one over another
in the hope of resolving this "the most impenetrable [tercet] in the
entire poem" (p. 412).

Strangely enough, it was only eighty years ago that what has come to be
considered an essential reference in verse 136 was brought to light by
H.D. Austin ("'Black But Comely' [^Par~. XXVII, 136-138],"
^Philological Quarterly~ 15 [1936]: 253-57): Song of Solomon (1:5), "I
am black but comely."  Once Auerbach ("Figurative Texts Illustrating
Certain Passages of Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Speculum~ 21 [1946], pp.
485-88) also treated this as an evident borrowing, it began to be more
widely noticed.  (For discussion of this tercet [and these two
contributions], see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
{Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}, pp. 174-80] and Pertile
["'Cos@i si fa la pelle bianca nera': l'enigma di ^Paradiso~ XXVII,
136-138," ^Lettere Italiane~ 43 {1991}]: 5-6.)

Scartazzini (comm. to this tercet) resurrects Jacopo della Lana's
solution: the Church.  In the twentieth century Circe became the
favored choice, supported by the Virgilian (^Aen~. VII.11) and Ovidian
(^Metam~. XIV.346) phrase, ^filia solis~, describing her (see Barbi
[^Problemi di critica dantesca~ {Florence: Sansoni, 1934}, pp.
292-93]); Scott [^Dante magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~ {Florence:
Olschki, 1977}], p. 229).  More recently, Bodo Guthm,uller ("'Che par
che Circe li avesse in pastura' [^Purg~. XIV, 42].  Mito di Circe e
metamorfosi nella ^Commedia~," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del
secondo Seminario dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T.
Crivelli [Florence: Cesati, 1999], pp. 248-50) takes issue with
Pertile's anti-Circean view.  Pertile ("'Cos@i si fa la pelle bianca
nera': l'enigma di ^Paradiso~ XXVII, 136-138," ^Lettere Italiane~ 43
[1991]: 3-26), who mines commentary to the Canticle of Canticles by
Guillaume de Saint-Thierry (pp. 7-18), had argued that for Dante, in
this passage, at least, the ^sposa~ (bride) of the Canticle represents
the human soul.

The Third Vatican Mythographer (XI.6) offers the following list of
those to whom the name ^filia solis~ was given: Pasiphae, Medea, Circe,
Phaedra, Dirce.  For the first of these, Pasiphae, see Selene Sarteschi
("Ancora sui versi 136-38 di ^Paradiso~ XXVII," ^Giornale storico della
letteratura italiana~ 118 [2000]: 401-21), referring to Servius as
source; but see the previous article of Letterio Cassata ("Tre ^cruces~
dantesche: III. La pelle di Pasifae," ^Studi Danteschi~ 48 [1971]:
29-43), who had arrived at this interpretation before her.  Antonio
Lanza (^La Commed@ia: Testo critico secondo i pi@u antichi manoscritti
fiorentini~, Nuova edizione [Anzio: De Rubeis, 1996], ^ad loc~.)
accepts Cassata's argument.

However, for still another candidate, see Hollander (^Allegory in
Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p.
191n.): If Dante knew either the ^Dittochaeon~ (Prudentius's poeticized
version of Scriptural narrative) or some digest or listing in which at
least its first line is found (cf. the online catalogue of the holdings
of the monastery at Melk, where it does in fact appear), he would have
seen some version of the following: "Eva columba fuit tunc candida;
nigra deinde / facta per anguinum malesuada fraude venenum" (Eve was at
first white as a dove; she then became black because of the venomous
serpent and its persuasive fraudulence).  Hollander begins by citing
Ovid (^Metam~. V.568-571) for the ^facies~ (face, aspect) of Proserpina
turning, in the obverse of what is described here, from sadness to
sunlit gladness; he then presses his case for Dante's figural melding
of Proserpina and Eve (a familiar enough equation, e.g., both women as
sinful "eaters" [Hollander, p. 179]).

There are problems with all the solutions heretofore proposed except,
perhaps, for the most generic one: human nature, or human beings in
general (or, in Pertile's formulation, the human soul).  This last
hypothesis is accompanied by only one slight problem: Dante has, in the
two preceding tercets, exemplified human conduct in a male child; why
should he, if his subject remains the same, suddenly switch to a
generic female child?  This would make a reader believe that the
reference changes to feminine for a reason, a hidden identity that we
are meant to puzzle out.  And we have certainly puzzled.  However, and
to take only the two most popular modern readings, Circe and the
Church, both of these seem flawed.  Circe does not have the virginal
aspect that these lines at least seem to confer upon the ^bella
figlia~.  And she really doesn't fit the context; she does not change
from good to bad, from lovely to ugly, etc.; she changes ^others~ into
something that they were not before.  In order to support this reading,
one must interpret Circe as changing the complexion of her captives,
hardly what Dante seems to be interested in here.  And what about the
Church?  As a possible interpretation, it gains support from its
longevity (it first was broached by Jacopo della Lana), from a modern
authority (Scartazzini), and from a skillful argument (see Chiavacci
Leonardi [^Paradiso, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ {Milan: Mondadori,
1997}], p. 763).  However, if one reads the entire context as political
and civil, as it surely seems to be, one finds that solution awkward.
Indeed, it could be argued that Dante's thoughts about the Church's
reform and revitalization ^outside a political context~ at the time he
was writing the last parts of ^Paradiso~ (with the Church, by electing
John XXII pope, having thereby confirmed its election of the Avignonian
captivity) are never anything but grim.  All we hear about the Church
in upper paradise is given in thundering invectives against her
failings.  It does not appear that Dante spent much thought on ways in
which it might be amended.

As for the proposal of Eve, it faces (as do all the others but that
putting forward human nature), a formidable challenge: the present
tense of the verb ^fa~.  If the verse read, in the original, ^f$e~, as
Lanza suggests it might have (^La Commed@ia: Testo critico secondo i
pi@u antichi manoscritti fiorentini~, Nuova edizione [Anzio: De Rubeis,
1996], ^ad loc.~), then the reference to Eve would be a lot more
plausible.  But such proposals must be advanced only with a sense of
restraint.

For a consideration of the varying views through the 1970s, see Gian
Paolo Marchi ("Canto XXVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], pp.
533-36) and, for some later ones, Pertile ("'Cos@i si fa la pelle
bianca nera': l'enigma di ^Paradiso~ XXVII, 136-138," ^Lettere
Italiane~ 43 [1991]: 3-26).

	|139-141.~  Perhaps because we are so near the Empyrean, many Dantists
do not observe the clearly political interests of the following
prophecy (vv. 142-148), which concludes the canto.  Any sort of
open-minded reading of this tercet makes it plain that the governance
Dante has in mind is not that of a pope, is not ecclesiastical in any
way.  It is instructive to compare the similar moment in ^Purgatorio~
XVI.94-96 (and see the appended note).  It is also instructive to study
the lengthy and concerted gloss to this passage of Francesco da Buti
(comm. to vv. 139-148), which interprets the entire prophecy as having
to do with the corruption and necessary reform of the Church.  That so
gifted a commentator can go astray is a warning to us lesser readers.
And see Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della
"Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001]), p. 156), who considers the
unreported prophecy Cacciaguida makes of Cangrande's great deeds
(^Par~. XVII.91-93) the third major prophecy in the poem and does not
mention this one.

	|142-148.~  As Tozer interprets verses 142-144: "The reckoning of the
Julian calendar involved a yearly error in excess of somewhat less than
a hundredth part of a day (^la centesma~), and this in Dante's time
amounted to an error of about nine days, so that January was advanced
by so much towards the end of winter and beginning of spring.  It was
this which was corrected by the Gregorian calendar two centuries and a
half later.  The general meaning, then, of ^prima che~, &c., is 'before
a very long time has passed'; but it is intended to be understood
ironically as meaning 'before long,' 'soon,' somewhat in the same way
as when we say 'not a hundred miles off' for 'near.'"  Whatever the
time involved, it is clear that this is a major prophecy in the poem,
in line with those found in ^Inf~. I ("veltro") and ^Purg~. XXXIII
("DXV"), as Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 180-91) has argued.  One of the
medieval meanings of "fortuna" was "storm at sea" -- cf. ^Purg~. XXXII,
116 -- and that clearly seems to be the image Dante uses here.  The
word for "fleet" (^classe~) is here used for the first time in Italian
(according to the ^Grande Dizionario~); it comes from Latin ^classis~,
the name for Ravenna as home of the Roman fleet and (for a time)
capital of the empire.  Within the context of the canto, Peter's slam
of the papacy also ends with a Roman thought (Scipio defeating
Hannibal); it is not really surprising that Beatrice here should
prophesy the coming of an emperor who will set things right.  (See,
among others, Scott [^Dante magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~
{Florence: Olschki, 1977}, pp. 232-33]; Hollander [^Dante: A Life in
Works~ {New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001}, pp. 142-44].)  Only
then will the human race steer a good course -- and the papacy, too,
get straightened out.  Christian Moevs ("The Metaphysical Basis of
Dante's Politics,"  in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence:
Cesati, 2004], p. 218) insists that Dante does not claim that the Bible
itself actually argues for empire.  But certainly ^Monarchia~
(II.xi.1), on its own authority, does: "And if the Roman empire was not
based on right, Adam's sin was not punished in Christ; but this is
false" (tr. P. Shaw).

	|142-143.~  See Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous
Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 {1903}], pp. 95-101) for an extended
presentation of what still coincides with the "standard" interpretation
of this problematic expression.  He shows that the Julian calendar,
itself developed to adjust "seasonal slippage" of considerable extent,
mismeasured the solar year by the one-hundredth part of a day.  Richard
Kay ("Unwintering January [Dante, ^Paradiso~ 27.142-143]," ^Modern
Language Notes~ 118 [2003]: 237-44) does not believe that Dante here
refers to this error (as is the general understanding among
^dantisti~), but to the hundredth part of a degree of sidereal
movement. Thus, according to his calculations, A.D. 8300 would be the
date to which Beatrice alludes (p. 240).  That would not seem to
conform to the dominant impression that she leaves with the reader,
which is that this promised event will happen soon.  And so Kay, as
were others before him, who used a different base for their
calculations, is forced to argue for Beatricean ironic understatement,
except that in his case the gap between hope and realization seems
unbridgeable.  Whatever our eventual understanding, Kay's note is
useful for its presentation of the sort of astronomical calculations
Dante would have known and used.

	|144.~  For medieval views that the stars were involved in shaping
these major human events, see Kennerly M. Woody ("Dante and the
Doctrine of the Great Conjunctions," ^Dante Studies~ 95 [1977]: 119-34).

	|145-148.~  The word ^fortuna~, as only several earlier commentators
have pointed out (e.g., the Anonimo Fiorentino and Tommaseo, both to
vv. 145-148 [although both eventually hedge their bets]), here nearly
certainly has the meaning "storm at sea."  In the nineteenth century,
beginning with Andreoli (comm. to vv. 145-147), that became the
dominant reading (and see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
{Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969}], pp. 181n., 190).
Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) also cited an analogous passage
(^Purg~. XXXII.116), "come nave in fortuna" (like a ship tossed in a
tempest), which might have offered a clue to others.  Perhaps the
vastly different context of that passage (the nascent Church is being
attacked by Roman emperors) is responsible for the failure of
attention.  However, for a more recent and differing opinion, see
Stefano Prandi (^Il "Diletto legno":  Aridit@a e fioritura mistica
nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1994], p. 120), who does not
consider pertinent the meteorological meaning of ^fortuna~ in this
occurrence of the word; the same may be said of Roberto Antonelli
("Canto XXVII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges
G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 422-23).

For notice of a similar and entirely relevant passage, see Scott
(^Dante's Political Purgatory~ [Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1996], p. 100), in his discussion of ^Purgatorio~
VI.76-78, pointing to ^Epist~. VI.3: "... When the throne of Augustus
is vacant, the whole world goes out of course, the helmsman and rowers
slumber in the ship of Peter, and unhappy Italy, forsaken and abandoned
to private control, and bereft of all public guidance, is tossed with
such buffeting of winds and waves as no words can describe, ..." (tr.
P. Toynbee).  See Tommaseo (comm. to these verses [and see the note to
verse 148]), citing an earlier form of the image in a discussion of
empire in ^Convivio~ IV.v.8: "Since universal peace reigned everywhere,
which it never did before nor ever shall again, the ship of human
society was speeding on an even course directly toward its proper port"
(tr. R. Lansing).  Christopher Kleinhenz ("Dante and the Bible:
Intertextual Approaches to the ^Divine Comedy~," ^Italica~ 63 [1986],
pp. 229-30) thinks that the prophecy is of "a powerful temporal ruler."
 Steno Vazzana ("Il Canto XXVII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni
1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], p. 726) sees the storm
at sea as representing the next and very angry emperor, "un nuovo
Scipione, salvatore armato" (a new Scipio, a savior in arms).

	|146.~  For some of the earlier presences (there are six of them in
all) of the word ^poppa~, signifying "poop deck," see the note to
^Purgatorio~ XXX.58.  And here ^prora~, of which this is the fifth and
final appearance (see ^Inf~. VIII.29 and XXVI.141; ^Purg~. XXX.58;
^Par~. XXIV.68), joins its naval counterpart for a shared final
appearance.

	|148.~  The canto ends with a corrective return to the image of failed
fruition (found in verse 126).  We are promised that the eventual
imperial reemergence, latent in history (one perhaps thinks of the
model represented by ^kairos~, the "fullness of time" in the coming of
Christ during the ^Pax romana~), will be, amazing even to Dante,
fulfilled before our very eyes.  This underlying reference had already
been precisely expressed in ^Convivio~ IV.v.8: "Nor was the world ever,
nor will it be, so perfectly disposed as at the time when it was guided
by the voice of the one sole prince and commander of the Roman people
[Augustus], as Luke the Evangelist testifies.  Since universal peace
reigned everywhere, which it never did before nor ever shall again, the
ship of human society was speeding on an even course directly toward
its proper port" (tr. R. Lansing).  This is, "reading Dante through the
lens of Dante" (see the last paragraph of the note to vv. 67-72),
perhaps the single best gloss to this difficult passage, even if it
appears to have been cited only by Tommaseo (see the note to vv.
145-148).  Much has recently been written about Dante's rejection of
the values he espoused in his earlier works, particularly ^Convivio~
(see the notes to ^Par~. VIII.34-39 and XVIII.91-93).  While it seems
nothing less than obvious, to any sort of objective examination that
this is true, it surely needs also to be observed that such
retrospective change of heart is not total.  These notes refer to the
minor works frequently, and to the ^Convivio~ most frequently (roughly
one hundred times).  In some respects it was the pre-study for
^Paradiso~ (see the note to ^Par~. III.91-96), embodying several of its
major themes and images (centrally, the intellectual banquet [the
"bread of angels"]).  Thus, while some of its matter may have been
"heretical" from the standpoint of the author of the later poem, many
of its judgments, particularly in the fourth treatise, in which the
^Convivio~ changed its course dramatically, now embracing Roman history
as one of its new themes, are exactly as we find them in ^Paradiso~
(see Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ {New Haven: Yale University
Press, 2001}], pp. 86-90).

In a decidedly less political context, Barbara Seward (^The Symbolic
Rose~ [New York: Columbia University Press, 1960], p. 22) cites St.
Bernard to the effect that the rose is "the flower of resurrection,
blossoming after the rain of disbelief."
