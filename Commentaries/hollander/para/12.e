	|1.~  The action of this canto begins, if we take its first line
literally, before the preceding one ends, i.e., before Thomas utters
the last syllables (or syllable) of ^vaneggia~.  See Iacopo della Lana
(comm. to vv. 1-3) and Alfonso Bertoldi (^Il canto XII del "Paradiso"~
["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni, 1913], p. 43, n. 5).
 That seems fitting, since these two cantos are, perhaps more than any
other pair in the work, mirror images of one another.  See Bertoldi
(^Il canto XI del "Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence:
Sansoni, 1903]), referring to them, despite their differing subjects
and feelings, as "twin cantos."  See also the note to ^Par~.
XII.142-145.  For one expression of the widely shared notice that the
first verse of this canto clearly is intended to attach it to its
predecessor, see Antonio Di Pietro ("Il canto dantesco dei due Guidi,"
in ^Studi in onore di Alberto Chiari~ [Brescia: Paideia, 1973], p.
421).  Compare, in contrast, the opening of Canto X, which stresses its
discontinuity with what preceded it.

Carmine Di Biase (^Il Canto XII del "Paradiso"~ [Naples: Ermanno
Cassitto 1992], p. 8), suggests that both cantos may be broken into
four parallel parts; in this canto, matching the four divisions of
Canto XI, ^exordium~ (XII.1-45), narrative in praise of Dominic
(XII.46-105), blame directed at his failed followers (XII.106-126),
and, in conclusion, the second circle of saints (XII.127-145).

	|3.~  Dante had earlier resorted to the image of the millstone ^(mola)~
to refer to the rotation of the Sun, seen from either pole, around the
earth (see ^Conv~. III.v.14).

	|4-6.~  The matching circles of twelve saints, each moving in such a
way as to match the other both in the eye and in the ear of the
beholder, anticipates the final image of the poem (^Par~.
XXXIII.143-145).

	|4.~  This first circle of saints was described (^Par~. XI.14) as
having completed a first full rotation; now it is seen as being on the
point of completing a second one.

	|6.~  The double repetition ^(moto~/^moto~; ^canto~/^canto)~ underlines
the matching quality of these two circles.

	|7-8.~  The previous tercet had divided the activity of the souls into
circling movement and song; this one divides that song itself
(repeating the word ^canto~) into two components, words ^(muse)~ and
melody ^(sirene)~.  Dante had used the word ^Muse~ (capitalized by
Petrocchi, if we have little idea of Dante's actual practice with
regard to capitalization) in ^Inferno~ I.7, in ^Purgatorio~ II.8 and
XXII.102, then in ^Paradiso~ II.9, to indicate the Muses of classical
antiquity.  Beginning here, however, and then in two later passages
(^Par~. XV.26 and XVIII.33) Petrocchi obviously believes that Dante
uses the lowercase word ^musa~ metaphorically, here to refer to poets
(the next use will refer to Virgil [or his poetry] as "nostra maggior
musa" [our greatest muse], and finally [^Par~. XVIII.33], to poetry
itself - or so most readers believe).

Torraca (comm. to vv. 7-9) seems to have been the first to remark on
the similar conjoining of Sirens and Muses in Boethius (^Cons. Phil~.
I.1[pr]).  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~],
^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 52,
believes that the Muses inspire the words of the song, the Sirens, the
music.

These two verses contain four words relating to music: ^canto~ (song)^,
musa~ (muse), ^serena~ (siren), ^tuba~ (brass musical instrument [more
precisely, "horn"]).  For the echoing effect that results from the
repetition of the first two, Dante may have had in mind the similar
effect found in Ovid's story of Echo and Narcissus, referred to in vv.
14-15.  The next (and last) time we read the noun ^tuba~ (^Par~.
XXX.35), it will be the metaphoric expression for Dante's poetic voice,
while here it refers to the voices of the singing saints.

	|9.~  The word ^splendore~ is, in Dante, always the result of light
^(luce)~, proceeding along its ray ^(raggio)~, and then reflected by an
object.  (For these interrelated terms, describing the three major
aspects of light, see Dante's earlier statement [^Conv.~ III.xiv.5].)
This verse makes clear Dante's belief that a second reflection (e.g.,
as in a mirror) is less vivid than that original splendor (but cf.
^Par~. II.94-105, which seems to contradict this understanding).  As we
have learned in Canto X (vv. 64-69), these crowns of dancing saints are
presented as circles of musical lights.  And in that earlier passage, a
simile, the comparison is to the rainbow, as will also be true in the
simile that begins in the next verse.

	|10-21.~  This simile, explicitly formal in its construction ^(Come...
cos@i)~ and, balanced in its content, containing one classical and one
biblical reference (Iris and the rainbow that God offered as a sign to
Noah), gives a sense of the identity of the two circles of saints,
despite their evident differences.

	|10.~  Dante apparently thought of thin (and thus "translucent") clouds
as actually being constituted of a layer of water-soaked dust suspended
in the atmosphere in which the rainbow appears.

	|11-18.~  There are a number of candidates for the classical source at
work here, primarily texts in Virgil and Ovid.  It seems likely that
Dante would have had the reference (^Metam~. I.270-271) to Juno's
sending Iris (her "handmaid," the rainbow) as a result of Jove's huge
storm, sent below in his attempt to extirpate, in a flood, the human
race (typified in the first murderer, Lycaon [the wolf-man], and hence
abandoned by piety and justice [^Metam~. I.149-150]).  That would
nicely balance these gestures toward "famous rainbows," since the
second of them is without doubt reflective of the rainbow that God sent
as the sign of his covenant (Gen. 9:13) with Noah and the few other
surviving members of humankind based on His promise never to send such
a destructive flood again.  (The first book of the ^Metamorphoses~ is,
as it were, the pagan equivalent of Genesis.)  We are also probably
meant to compare the unchecked vengeful desires of the king of the
pagan gods with the moderated sternness of God the Father.

Dante adds a second rainbow, as his context demands, not as he found in
his sources, but as may at least occasionally be observed in Tuscany
even today.

	|13.~  The second circle is, like the second rainbow, wider than the
first.  Dante's science believed that the second rainbow was born from
the first, not that it was part of a double refraction of light.

	|14-15.~  The reference is to the nymph Echo (^Metam~. III.356-510),
who fell in love with Narcissus.  She wasted away with unrequited
passion until all that was left of her was a voice.  This second
simile, within the overarching simile that compares the two circles of
saints to the double rainbow, replicates the form of such a rainbow.

	|18.~  As Tommaseo suggests (comm. to vv. 16-18), the present tense of
the verb ^allagare~ (to flood) suggests the past, present, and future
application of God's covenant with humankind: This global flood has not
recurred and will never do so.

	|22-25.~  Dante seemingly intuits the extraordinary effect made by
large modern-day symphony orchestras when called upon to modulate huge
sound suddenly into silence.  If the reader imagines Beethoven as the
background music to this scene, perhaps he or she will better
experience what is projected by these verses.  Of course, the
miraculous sound has not so much to do with extraordinary musical
abilities as it does with the result of living in God's grace, in which
all is harmonious, even sudden silence.

	|26-30.~  These similetic elements of this passage (vv. 22-30), two
eyes opening or closing as one and Dante ineluctably being drawn to the
voice of a new spirit (it will turn out to be Bonaventure), speak to
the sense of the overpowering quality of the love and beauty that
affects both the performers and their observer.  Torraca (comm. to vv.
28-30) points out that the compass, invented only a short while before,
had already become a familiar image in thirteenth-century Italian
poetry, e.g., in poems by Guido Guinizzelli and in Ristoro d'Arezzo.

	|31-33.~  St. Bonaventure is about to praise the leader of Thomas's
Order, St. Dominic, in response to Thomas's praise of Francis, the
leader of his own.  For information about the speaker, see the note to
vv. 127-128.

	|34-36.~  In the previous canto (^Par~. XI.40-42) Thomas had gone out
of his way to insist that praise of either Francis or Dominic is
necessarily praise of the other; Bonaventure matches him.

	|35.~  While Dante has made every effort to "militarize" the sweetness
of St. Francis, making both him and Dominic share the verb ^militaro~
(lit. "soldiered"), the following three tercets show that he is willing
to associate himself with the traditional portrayal of Dominic as
warlike, while the traditional depiction of Francis is decidedly not
(see the note to ^Par~. XI.91).  On the other hand, it is again notable
that he has included Francis within the construct of the Christian
soldier.

	|37-45.~  These three tercets contain seven words that associate the
two friars with militarism and imperial rule: ^essercito~ (army),
^riarmar~ (to rearm), ^insegna~ (battle standard), ^imperador~
(emperor), ^regna~ (reigns), ^milizia~ (soldiers), ^campioni~
("champions," i.e., those who excel in single combat).

	|37-39.~  The "troops" obviously form the Church Militant, now led by
the newly approved mendicant orders, expensive to rearm, since it took
the blood of the apostles to accomplish that task (see Aversano, ^Dante
daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the
author on 11 September 2001], p. 53, for reasons to prefer this gloss
to that which insists the reference is to Christ's blood, an
interpretation unopposed since the earliest days of the commentary
tradition; Aversano refers the reader to ^Par~. XXVII.40-45 for
confirming evidence).  Despite that, the soldiers, apparently, still
lack resolve.

	|38.~  The "standard" of this army is obviously the Cross.

	|40-45.~  The meaning is that God succored His "troops," not because
they were particularly worthy, but because He extended them His grace.
For a clear summary of the two kinds of grace at work in Dante's world,
operating grace (which Dante received from God, through the agency of
Beatrice, in ^Inferno~ II) and cooperating grace, see Scott
(^Understanding Dante~ [Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 2004],
pp. 187-90).  Once a sinner is justified by the receipt of operating
grace, which is gratuitous (i.e., cannot be earned), he or she must
"cooperate" in order to merit eventual reward (salvation).  Scott
reviews the American discussion of this issue, which was dominated by
the views of Charles Singleton, until Antonio Mastrobuono (^Dante's
Journey of Sanctification~ [Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1990])
clarified the nature of the problem.

	|40.~  That God is here referred to as "emperor" (as He is on only two
other occasions: ^Inf~. I.124 and ^Par~. XXV.41) makes Dante's comfort
with imperial trappings clear, especially to his Guelph enemies.  This
term for God is not in itself unwarranted in Christian tradition, far
from it.  But Dante uses it here in an ecclesiastical context where it
might seem, at least to some, improper.

	|43.~  The reference ("as was said") is to ^Paradiso~ XI.31-36, where
Thomas tells of God's appointment of these two stalwarts to succor the
bride of Christ, His Church.

	|44.~  Francis (typified by love) is best represented by his ^deeds~,
Dominic (typified by knowledge), by his ^words~.

For Francis and Dominic as "postfigurations" of Elijah and Enoch, see
Ubertino of Casale: "... in thipo Helie et Enoch Franciscus et
Dominicus singulariter claruerunt" (... as antitypes of Elijah and
Enoch Francis and Dominic stand strikingly forth), cited by Carmine Di
Biase (^Il Canto XII del "Paradiso"~ [Naples: Ermanno Cassitto 1992],
p. 27).

	|46-57.~  Dominic was "born 1170, in the village of Calaroga, in Old
Castile; he is supposed to have belonged to the noble family of
Guzm@an, his father's name being Felix, his mother's Joanna.  The
latter is said to have dreamed before he was born that she gave birth
to a dog with a torch in its mouth, which set the world on fire.  At
the age of fourteen he went to the university of Palencia, where he
studied theology for ten or twelve years.  He was early noted for his
self-denial and charity.  In 1195 he became canon of the cathedral of
Osma.  In 1215 he accompanied Folquet, bishop of Toulouse, to the
Lateran Council; and in the same year, on his return to Toulouse, he
founded his order of Preaching Friars, which was formally recognized by
Honorius III in 121[7].  He died in Aug. 1221 at Bologna, where he was
buried.  He was canonized soon after his death (in 1234) by Gregory IX"
(Toynbee, "Domenico" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]). And see G.R.
Sarolli, "Domenico, santo," ^ED~ II (1970), pp. 546-51.  Sarolli points
out that, when Dominic, with six companions, arrived in Toulouse in
1215, on the verge of forming a more structured group, he associated
with Folco di Marsiglia (whom we encountered in ^Par~. IX.88-102), the
newly appointed bishop of that city.

For a global consideration of Bonaventure's praise of Dominic, see
Giuseppe Ledda ("Osservazioni sul panegirico di San Domenico,"
^L'Alighieri~ 27 [2006]: 105-25).

For Guglielmo Gorni ("Due note su ^Paradiso~ XI," ^L'Alighieri~ 23
[2004]: 51-56) the description of Dominic's birthplace does not work in
tandem with the description of Francis's (see the note to ^Par~.
XI.43-48), a function the text itself (^Par~. XI.37-42) claims -- as
Gorni admits -- but in an opposite way, that is, to support the
position of the Spiritual Franciscans (see the note to ^Par~. XI.58-60)
and to undermine that of the Dominicans.  A key component of Gorni's
reading is the pun found in the name Calaroga, the town in Spain where
Dominic was born, which not only has the resonance of the setting sun
(by common consent) but an innate negative sense, opposing the
optimistic ^oriens~ of Assisi/Ascesi, in its first two syllables,
^cala~, which reflects a sense of the verb ^calare~, to sink or fall.
It is difficult to accept this assessment, which would undo all that
Dante has crafted to make Dominic and Francis equal - even if Dominic
is not seen by Dante in the Rose of the saved souls in the Empyrean, a
point insisted on by Gorni, in whose view the third ^cantica~ is (p.
54) no less, in its essence, than "a manifesto of Spiritual
Franciscanism."  Among the commentators, few would support Gorni's
hypothesis, but, for one who might, see Mestica (comm. to vv. 37-39),
making two fairly obvious points: The Seraphim are closer to God than
are the Cherubim; Dominic is never mentioned again in the poem, while
Francis is.  Nonetheless, Dante, here and for the rest of the
^Paradiso~, makes the core "Dominican" value (knowledge) and the
"Franciscan" one (love) so conjoined that a reader naturally resists
(and should) any attempt to make Dante more a praiser of Dominic (a
view sponsored by Busnelli's Thomistic view of Dante's theology) than
of Francis (or vice versa), either of which understandings the text
rather clearly and insistently strives to make all but impossible.

	|46.~  Spain is located in the westernmost part of Europe.

	|47.~  Zephyr is the west wind.  For the association of Dominic with
the west and Francis with the east, see Alfonso Bertoldi (^Il canto XI
del "Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni,
{1903}], p. 47 [n. 27]), adding the details that for Dante, the
Florentine, the main Dominican church (S. Maria Novella) was situated
in the western part of the city, while the main Franciscan church (S.
Croce) was located in eastern Florence.

	|49-51.~  Torraca (comm. to vv. 56-57) thinks that the waves are found
on the surface of the Ebro, the river running two miles from Dominic's
native city, an argument contested vigorously by Alfonso Bertoldi (^Il
canto XI del "Paradiso"~ ["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence:
Sansoni, {1903}], pp. 45-46), who supports the early commentators'
belief that the reference is to the Atlantic Ocean.  Others specify the
Bay of Biscay.  After Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 49-51), however, the
ruling understanding is that the passage refers to this body of water.

The sun hides itself from human sight when, at or near the summer
solstice, it sets beyond the sight of those on land, because it has
moved so far out over the Atlantic.  For Dante, we must remember, to
the west of the Gates of Hercules lies "the world where no one lives"
(^Inf~. XXVI.117).

	|52.~  Calaruega ("Calaroga," in Dante's Italian), a small town in
Castile, "fortunate" in having been the birthplace of Dominic.

	|53-54.~  The royal arms of Castile bear a castle in the second and
third quarters, and a lion in the first and fourth.  "Thus on one side
of the shield the lion is subdued by the castle, and on the other
subdues it" (Oelsner, comm. to these verses).  The images represent the
kingdoms of Castile and Leon, respectively.

	|55.~  The vocabulary of feudal times (^drudo~, "vassal") combines with
that of erotic poetry (^amoroso~, "loving") to interrupt the military
associations of Dominic, and eventually presents him, like Francis, as
a "husband" (see verse 61, ^sponsalizie~, "nuptials").  The word
^drudo~, a triple hapax, i.e., a word appearing once in each ^cantica~
(see Hollander ["An Index of Hapax Legomena in Dante's ^Commedia~,"
^Dante Studies~ 106 {1988}: 81-110] for a listing of all examples of
this phenomenon in the poem), occurs previously in ^Inferno~ XVIII.134
and ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.155, in both cases referring to a male partner
in an illicit sexual liaison, in the first case, the man sleeping with
the whore, Tha,is; in the second, the giant beating his harlot, the
Church in its Avignonian captivity.  Thus its context in the poem works
against those who would read Dante's treatment of Dominic as
sugar-coated (see the note to verse 57).

The new interpretation of the second scene offered by Filippo Bognini
("Gli occhi di Ooliba: Una proposta per ^Purg~. XXXII 148-60
e XXXIII 44-45," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 7 [2007]: 73-103)
does not change the valence of the preceding remark, but does alter the
identities of the "actors" in the pageant in ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.
In a new (and entirely convincing) reading of the major characters in
that scene, Bognini demonstrates that the whore is Ezechiel's Jerusalem
and thus Dante's Florence, while the giant reflects Goliath as Robert
of Anjou, the king of Naples and the Guelph leader in Italy, prime enemy
of Henry VII.
See as well his further study of the problem of the "DXV" (or "515"),
"Per Purg., XXXIII, 1-51: Dante e Giovanni di Boemia," Italianistica 37 (2008): 11-48.

	|56.~  If Francis is presented as a lover, Dominic is (here) presented
as a fighter, but even here he is first described (verse 55) as
^l'amoroso drudo~.  See the note to verse 55.

	|57.~  Raimondo Spiazzi ("Il Canto XII," in ^"Paradiso": Letture degli
anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp. 339-41) thinks
that the word ^crudo~ (cruel) is uncalled for, and he sets off on a
lengthy defense: St. Dominic was in fact, and despite his crusading
spirit, the most mild-mannered person imaginable.  However, others take
this verse at face value, and see its pertinence to Dominic's labors
against the Cathars (e.g., Alessandro Ghisalberti ["Canto XII," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone {Florence: Cesati, 2002}], pp. 184-86), during the
period 1203-1210, when Dominic moved from preaching and debate to more
violent means; but even Ghisalberti insists on the predominance of the
"sweet" approach.  Others have been less tolerant of Dominic's
behavior.  This is the last of thirteen appearances of the adjective
^crudo~ in the poem (leaving to one side the related words ^crudele~,
^crudelt@a~, etc.); in none of the preceding dozen presences of the
word does it have a mitigated meaning.  As a result, the motives of
those who argue for such mitigation here seem suspect.  Dominic, as
presented by Dante, is a tough warrior whom the poet goes out of his
way also to present as a "lover."

	|58-60.~  The embryonic mind of Dominic was so powerful that it could
send concepts (or at least images) to the mother who was bearing him.
In this way he lent his mother the gift of prophecy.  The early
commentators are frequently misled, and think the reference of "lei" is
not to the mother but to Dominic's ^mente~ in the preceding line, thus
making a prophet of ^him~.  However, legend has it that, before his
birth, his mother had a dream of a black-and-white dog who carried a
torch in its mouth, which set fire to the whole world.  That is what
most of its interpreters today believe is referenced in the line, the
mother's vision of her unborn son's wide effect on humanity.  Since the
colors of the habits of the Dominicans are black and white and since an
easily available pun (^Domini canes~ = the dogs of God) was in
circulation at the time and was included in the first official "Life"
of Dominic (by Teodorico d'Appoldia), the dream became a permanent
piece of Dominican lore.

Frequent in discussions of this passage are citations of Isaiah 49:1,
"Dominus ab utero vocavit me" (The Lord has called me from the womb);
but see also Luke 1:15, "Spiritu Sancto replebitur adhuc ex utero
matris suae" (and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from
his mother's womb), describing John the Baptist, referred to by Carmine
Di Biase (^Il Canto XII del "Paradiso"~ [Naples: Ermanno Cassitto
1992], p. 40n. -- first cited by Tommaseo [comm. to vv. 58-60]).

	|62.~  Where Francis married Poverty, Dominic took Faith as his wife.

	|63.~  A difficult line to translate convincingly, partly because the
noun ^salute~ has different meanings in Dante.  In Dominic's case, he
will find ^salvation~ in his faith; he cannot "save" her, but he does
keep her ^safe~ from heresy.  Vellutello's gloss (comm. to vv. 61-66)
has guided us as far as the sense is concerned: "because he saved the
Faith, battling for it against heretics, and she in turn kept him safe."

	|64-66.~  A woman present at the baptismal ceremony, the child's
godmother, answers (saying "I do") for the child when the priest asks
whether he or she wishes to be baptized.

Dominic's godmother dreamed that he appeared with a bright star in his
forehead that illumined the world; his "heirs" are, obviously, his
fellow Dominicans.

	|67-69.~  The riddling diction yields its meaning after only a little
effort.  As Tozer (comm. to this tercet) unravels it: "An inspiration
from Heaven ^(Quinci)~ was communicated to his parents to name him by
the possessive adjective (viz. ^Dominicus~) derived from the name of
the Lord (^Dominus~), who possessed him entirely."

	|67.~  The word ^costrutto~ has caused a certain difficulty.  In modern
Italian it means "sense, meaning" but that meaning is not easily
assigned to the word here.  Tozer (comm. to vv. 67-69) sorts things out
as follows: "... 'that he might be in name what he was in reality';
^costrutto~: 'the form of his name'; similarly in ^Purg~. XXVIII.147
^costrutto~ means 'a form of words' or 'sentence': and in ^Par~.
XXIII.24 ^senza costrutto~ is 'without putting it into words.'"

	|68.~  From the Empyrean (and not this heaven of the Sun), the text
suggests, the Holy Spirit inspired the baby's parents to call him
"Dominicus" (^Domini~-cus -- the Latin for his name, Domenico [from the
possessive form of the noun ^Dominus~, the Lord]).

	|69.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~, ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001]), p. 54, sees
this verse as reflecting II Kings 12:25 (II Samuel 12:25), Nathan the
prophet's renaming of the infant Solomon, thus named, according to the
preceding verse, by his mother, Bathsheba: "and [Nathan] called his
name Jedidiah [the Beloved of God, 'Amabilis Domino' in the Vulgate]
because of the Lord."  Aversano's argument, which is less than
immediately convincing, gains strength because of the presence of
Nathan in this canto (verse 136), where he is spoken of exactly as he
is in this verse of the Bible, "Nathan propheta" (but see also II Kings
[II Samuel] 7:2 [and in six other O.T. ^loci~]).

	|71-75.~  This is the first set of the so-called "Cristo rhymes."
There will be three others, occurring in ^Paradiso~ XIV.104-108,
XIX.104-108, and XXXII.83-87.  For a valuable early study of this
phenomenon, see Francesco D'Ovidio ("^Cristo~ in rima," in his ^Studii
sulla "Divina Commedia"~ [Milan: Sandron, 1901], pp. 215-24).  It is
clear that, for Dante's purposes, no other word is good enough to rhyme
with "Christ," who is the Word.  The pattern is not unusual in Dante,
three occurrences (in the spheres) followed by one in the Empyrean, not
significantly adding up to four, but reminding us of the Trinity, which
is three in one.

Porena (comm. to vv. 73-78) holds that D'Ovidio was correct to argue
that the word ^Cristo~ is allowed to rhyme only with itself because, as
a penitential gesture, Dante wants to undo the scabrous act he had
perpetrated when, in one of his sonnets attacking Forese Donati's
behaviors, he had rhymed the name of the Lord with ^tristo~
(distraught) and ^malo acquisto~ (ill-gotten gains).

	|71-72.~  The chore given Dominic to perform can hardly fail to remind
a Christian reader of the task that Adam and Eve were given and failed
to perform, to dress and keep the garden.  See Genesis 2:15.

	|74-75.~  What exactly was Christ's "first counsel" to his followers?
In the past one hundred years there has been continuing and uncertain
discussion of this seemingly simple question.  But it was not always
thus.  Almost every early commentator seizes on the same biblical
passage, Matthew 19:21, Christ's advice to the rich young man to sell
all that he possesses, give the proceeds to the poor, and then follow
Him.  This was the view of Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 73-75) and
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 73-87), who added the detail that
Dominic followed this advice when he sold all his books and gave the
money to the poor.  Others who agree include Serravalle (comm. to vv.
73-75), Landino (comm. to vv. 73-75), Vellutello (comm. to vv. 73-75),
Daniello (comm. to vv. 73-75), Venturi (comm. to verse 75), Lombardi
(comm. to verse 75), Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 73-75), and, at the
beginning of the modern era of Dante scholarship, Scartazzini (comm. to
verse 75).  For a summarizing sense of nearly six hundred years of
near-total agreement, see Oelsner (comm. to verse 75): "The counsel of
poverty (Matth. 19:21, whence the phrase 'counsels of perfection').
Thomas Aquinas, while distinguishing between the ^precepts~ and the
^counsels~ of Christ, says that the latter may all be reduced to three
-- Poverty, Continence, and Obedience.  The first counsel, then, is
Poverty."  However, that long-held, sensible, and nearly unanimous view
has recently undergone some puzzled (and puzzling?) scrutiny.  A
certain latent dissatisfaction with it (because Francis was popularly
identified with poverty, but not Dominic?) peeps out from the long
gloss of Carroll (comm. to vv. 46-105).  Torraca (comm. to vv. 73-75)
does not even refer to the familiar and insistent earlier gloss, but
simply says that the reference is to the first Beatitude, "Blessed are
the poor in spirit" (Matth. 5:3).  Mestica (comm. to verse 75) briefly
considers the question of which of these two texts from Matthew is most
appropriate and decides in favor of the old favorite, both because, in
his view, a Beatitude is not "advice," and because Dominic did in fact
sell his books and gave the resulting cash to the poor.  During the
next thirty years no commentator sides with Torraca, but then Grabher
(comm. to vv. 73-75) simply makes reference to both passages in Matthew
as though there were no debate over the issue of which one Dante had in
mind.  It is Manfredi Porena (comm. to vv. 73-78) who seems to have
been the commentator most responsible for the current view that this
verse is problematic.  Sapegno (comm. to vv. 73-75) supports that
opinion, and sides with Torraca's view (in favor of Matth. 5:3);
Mattalia (comm. to vv. 74-75) mounts an effective counter-attack.
Chimenz (73-75) retreats, Fallani (75) fights back, Giacalone (73-75)
equivocates, as do Singleton (75) and Bosco/Reggio (73-75), who really
want both humility and poverty to identify Dominic, and who also adduce
Matthew 6:25f.  Pasquini/Quaglio (75) return to Matthew 3:5 without
discussing the ^crux~.  However, Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi
(^Paradiso, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1997],
p. 342) returns to the original formulation, rescuing Christ's appeal
for the virtues of poverty.

For a departure from the sources battled over in the commentaries
(Matth. 5:3; Matth.19:21), see Alessandro Ghisalberti ("Canto XII," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 184): Matthew 6:33
(part of a passage already mentioned as a potential source by
Bosco/Reggio).  See also Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the
^Paradiso~, ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September
2001]), p. 54, who dismisses the two conflicting and standard
explanations, poverty and humility, arguing that both these are central
attributes of Francis, and thus unlikely to be applied to Dominic (not
a convincing view, since the bulk of the two cantos is dedicated to the
similarity between the two heroes of the modern Church).  Aversano
points to the context introduced by the phrase ^amoroso drudo~ ("loving
vassal" -- verse 55) and chooses the passage from Luke (10:25) that
encourages us to love God and our neighbor.

The problem of the precise reference in verse 75 is complicated by the
neighboring presences of two instances of the adjective ^primo~
(first).  Are they used as synonyms, in both cases having a temporal
relevance, or not?  We think that they are, and thus have translated as
we have ("since the first affection manifest in him / was for the
initial precept taught by Christ").  Some, however, believe that the
first ^primo~ is temporal, that the second has to do with order of
importance, i.e., the most important of Christ's teachings, which would
offer a bit more latitude as one searched through the Gospels.  If we
are correct, what then is "the initial precept" taught by Jesus?
(Salsano, "consiglio," ^ED~ II [1970], p. 159b, understands ^consiglio~
to equate with "precetto divino.")  That can in fact be the first
Beatitude.  Or, if Oelsner (see the first paragraph, above) is correct,
and Dante's sense of the word ^consiglio~ flows through St. Thomas's
distinction between it and "precept," then the first "counsel" may
indeed be thought of as accepting poverty, first among the three
"counsels" of Christ: poverty, continence, obedience.  Either way,
poverty is the issue focal to this line.  This seems more than
acceptable, since Dominic is presented as parallel in his virtues to
Francis (Grandgent [comm. to verse 75] points out that vv. 73-75 of
both cantos thus deal with poverty), since Dominicans as well as
Franciscans took vows of poverty, and since the next tercet, although
also less clearly than some might like, would seem to associate him
both with Francis and with poverty as well.

	|76-78.~  "For this have I come": See Mark 1:38, "ad hoc enim veni," as
Jesus announces his intention to preach.  The baby Dominic's closeness
to the earth reminds us of the similar association of Francis,
indelibly associated with the dust at the end of his life (^Par~.
XI.115-117).  Poverty and humility, more usually associated with
Francis, are both present in this vignette, as preconditions for
Dominic's preacherly calling.

	|79.~  Dominic's father's name, Felice, means "happy" ^(felix)~ in
Latin.

	|80-81.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) say that Dante, in the
life of Dominic by Theodoric of Appoldia, could have read that his
mother's name, Giovanna, meant "grace of God," or "full of grace."
Theodoric's source (and Dante's) may have been, says Torraca (comm. to
vv. 79-81), Uguccione da Pisa.

	|82-105.~  This passage presents the life and accomplishments of
Dominic, after his engendering and childhood (vv. 58-81), the ensemble
paralleling that portion of the preceding canto dedicated to the life
and works of Francis (^Par~. XI.55-117).

	|82-85.~  Dominic's honest religiosity is contrasted with the
eye-on-the-prize sort of sham activities of two intellectuals, both of
whom died within Dante's lifetime.  The first, Enrico di Susa, from
Ostia (died in 1271), was a famous canon lawyer (and thus Dante fires
another salvo at the venal practitioners of this profession), while
Taddeo d'Alderotto (the probable reference is to him) was a Florentine
(died in 1295) who studied and then taught medicine at Bologna.  Dante
mocks his translation of Aristotle's ^Ethics~ in ^Convivio~ I.x.10.  In
these two men Dante pillories two kinds of false intellectual activity,
religious law and Aristotelian science, both of which were of great
importance to him.

	|87.~  The metaphorical vineyard (fairly obviously the Church) turns
gray with rot if its keeper (obviously the pope) does not take good
care of it.  This reference to Boniface VIII is thinly veiled.

	|88-96.~ Carroll (comm. to vv. 46-105) paraphrases this elegant
pastiche of a canon lawyer's style as follows: "[Dominic] asked from
the Head of the Church none of the evil privileges so eagerly sought
for by others: to distribute only a third or a half of moneys left for
charitable purposes, retaining the rest; to receive the first vacant
benefice; or to use for himself the tithes which belong to God's poor.
His one request was for leave to fight against an erring world for the
seed of the Faith."

	|88-90.~  Bonaventure, here most assuredly Dante's mouthpiece,
distinguishes between the papacy, in its design supportive of the poor,
and the pope (the hated Boniface VIII in 1300), ignoring that design.

	|91-93.~  These three corrupt practices all reveal the avarice of
prelates, the first and third involving theft of monies destined for
the poor, the second, advancement in ecclesiastical position.  For this
last, see Tozer (comm. to this tercet): "The reference is to the
^expectationes~, or nominations to posts not yet vacant that popes of
the day were pleased to make."  Obviously, none of these
self-aggrandizing activities had as their goal support for the
benevolent tasks that customarily fell to the Church.

	|93.~  The Latin ("the tenth part that belongs to the poor," the tax
collected by the clergy) refers to the tithe, the 10% of a
parishioner's income that the Church collected in order to help feed
and clothe the poor.  Not even this was safe from predatory clergy, who
took these funds for their own use.

	|95.~  See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse): Dominic's request for
approval of his Order was made to Pope Innocent III in 1215, and only
approved late in 1216 by Pope Honorius III, the newly elected pope (the
Church had for a time prohibited the formation of new Orders).
However, in 1205, Dominic had gone to Rome, seeking permission to wage
a campaign against heretics, which was granted.  Between 1207 and 1214
he was part of the eventually bloody attempt to bring the Albigensian
Cathars back into the fold, alongside of Folco di Marsiglia (see the
notes to ^Par~. IX.40 and to ^Par~. IX.94).  Bosco/Reggio try to keep
Dominic's hands free of Albigensian blood, saying that, on the day of
the terrible battle of Muret (12 September 1213), Dominic was at prayer
in a church.  However, given the poet's praise of Folco, the leader of
that crusade (if Simon de Montfort was in charge of the army at that
particular battle), he may have imagined a Dominic as warlike as his
Folco.  See vv. 97-102, where Dominic's forcefulness in combating
heresy is applauded.

	|96.~  This indication reminds us of the precise balance in the two
circles of saints that we have seen in these two cantos, each
containing twelve souls.  See Carmine Di Biase (^Il Canto XII del
"Paradiso"~ [Naples: Ermanno Cassitto, 1992], pp. 68-69) and Bruno
Porcelli ("Numeri e nomi nei canti danteschi del sole," ^Giornale
storico della letteratura italiana~ 117 [2000]: 8-100) for thoughts
about the importance of the number twelve in the heaven of the Sun.

	|97-102.~  While the militarism of Dominic's Order may be metaphorical,
referring to his preaching, that his "career" began with a literal war,
the crusade against the Albigensians, certainly colors these lines,
whatever Dante's intention.

	|98.~  Dominic fought against heresy with the support of Pope Honorius
III, who had approved his request to found a new Order.  However, he
had also had the approval of Pope Innocent III to subdue the
Albigensians and bring them back to the fold (see the note to verse
95).  In that effort, the crusaders' military force was more than
metaphoric.

	|101-102.~  The "resistance was most stubborn" in Provence, with the
Albigensian Cathars.  This detail again tends to erode the distinction
between Dominic the Christian debater and Dominic the Christian
soldier.  See the note to vv. 97-102.

	|103-105.~  Raoul Manselli ("Il canto XII del ^Paradiso~," in ^Nuove
letture dantesche~, vol. VI [Florence: Le Monnier, 1973], p. 118)
characterizes this tercet, moving from Dominic's day into Dante's, with
the Order burgeoning with new chapters, as setting a tranquil
conclusion to a story that began with military roughness.  One might
add that it has hardly moderated its tone until now.

	|106-111.~  These verses offer a kind of summary of both saints' lives.
The resulting image, the two wheels of a chariot of war, already
deployed in the earthly paradise (introduced at ^Purg~. XXIX.107 and on
the scene until ^Purg~. XXXII.147), is perhaps remembered in the final
verses of the poem.  For the "tensions, deriving from the need
simultaneously to individuate and unify, that subtend the stories of
Francis and Dominic," see Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy":
Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992],
pp. 198-202, 217).

	|112-113.~  Here begins the denunciation of the current Franciscan
Order (cf. the similar attack on the wayward Dominicans, ^Par~.
XI.118-123).  Where in the last canto the image of Thomas's Order was a
merchant ship, here that founded by Francis is presented as a chariot
of war.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) complain that, after the
fresh and convincing images of the last canto, some of those
encountered in this one, beginning with these chariot wheels, seem
forced.  Here Dominic is compared to the rim of a wheel that leaves a
clear imprint in the earth, while his followers do no such thing.

	|114.~  Abruptly switching semantic fields, Bonaventure compares the
good old days of Francis's leadership and the current condition of the
Order to wine casks: Good wine leaves crust in the barrel it was
contained in, while bad wine leaves mold.

	|115-117.~  The faltering Order is depicted as reversing its track; see
the parallel moment in Thomas's denunciation of the Dominicans (^Par~.
XI.124-132), portrayed as sheep wandering astray, away from the Rule,
in search of new nourishment.

	|117.~  There is agreement among the commentators about the difficulty
of making exact sense of this verse.  We have not attempted to do more
than give its obvious general meaning, though it happens that we are in
fairly close agreement with the gloss of Daniele Mattalia to this
tercet, who takes issue with some of the more strained attempts to make
sense of this line, i.e., the understanding, begun with Michele Barbi
(^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934], p. 287),
that the Franciscan backsliders retrogress while facing forward, moving
their front foot back toward (and then behind?) the other.  Even if
Dominic has been described as "the holy athlete" (verse 56), that way
of retrogression seems to require muscular skills and patience well
beyond those of most corrupt barefoot friars.  Momigliano (comm. to vv.
115-117) justly complains that this line seems forced, and lays some of
the blame for that on the verb form ^gitta~ (lit. "throws"), forced by
rhyme.

	|118-120.~  The obvious Scriptural allusion (to Matth. 13:24-30, the
parable of the wheat and the tares) somehow seems to have escaped the
earliest commentators.  It appears first in Landino (comm. to these
verses) and then is repeated in almost all subsequent comments.  The
reference of the tercet is a cause of some debate.  See Raoul Manselli,
"francescanesimo," ^ED~ III (1971), pp. 15-16; his view is that the
word "loglio" (tares) does not refer to the Spiritual Franciscans, as
some believe, but to all corrupt members of the Order, whatever their
leaning in the controversy between Spirituals and Conventuals.

	|122.~  The word ^volume~ (volume), occurring first in ^Inferno~ I.84
and last in ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.86, literally runs from one end of the
poem to the other.  It occurs nine times, and always else either refers
to God's book (the Scriptures) or to his "other book," the created
universe (except in its first use, where it refers to the ^Aeneid~ [see
the note to ^Inf~. I.84]).  Thus, to refer to the slender booklet, the
Rule of the Franciscan Order, as a ^volume~ is to employ a heavy word.

	|124-126.~  Umberto Cosmo (^L'ultima ascesa: Introduzione alla lettura
del "Paradiso"~, ed. B. Maier [Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1965 {1936}],
pp. 149-54) contrasts the inner tension among the Franciscan ranks with
the struggles that afflicted Dominic's order, shaped by external
enemies.  For a study locating Francis, as Dante does here, in the
middle, see Stanislao da Campagnola ("Francesco d'Assisi in Dante,"
^Laurentianum~ 24 [1983]: 175-92); and for his indebtedness to
Ubertino's very words for his characterizations of Francis
^(seraphicus)~ and Dominic ^(cherubicus)~, see p. 182n.  See also
Raoul Manselli ("Dante e gli Spirituali francescani," ^Letture
classensi~ 11 [1982]: 47-61) for an overview of Dante's response to the
Spiritual Franciscans, with many bibliographical indications in the
notes.  Mario Trovato ("^Paradiso~ XI," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 168), on the additional basis of his interpretation
of ^Paradiso~ XI.109-114, lends his support to Manselli's position.
And for what has been the standard view of the tension among the
Conventual and Spiritual Franciscans themselves (at least after
Manselli's work), see Manselli, pp. 57-58: Matteo d'Acquasparta is
criticized for loosening the strictures of the Rule of the Order, while
Ubertino da Casale is seen as too rigid in his adherence to the
founder's insistence on the importance of poverty in a true Christian
life.  Some have tried to argue against the dominant understanding,
making Matteo the one who is overly strict in his interpretation of the
Rule, while Ubertino is too loose; but see Manselli, "francescanesimo,"
^ED~ III (1971), p. 16, for a refutation.  And see his ^lectura~ ("Il
canto XII del ^Paradiso~," in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. VI
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1973], pp. 122-23) for a demonstration that
^coartare regulam~ and ^fugere regulam~ were ^formulae~ in discussions
of the day.

	|125.~  We have translated "la scrittura" in the narrowest sense ("the
Rule").  In Dante's Italian the word has meant both writing in general
and, on some occasions, the Bible.  Here it is a third form of writing,
something more than ordinary words and to be taken as post-biblical,
but having a similar authority.  (See the note to verse 122 for the
similar status of the noun ^volume~.)  Mario Aversano (^Dante e gli
"scritti" di San Francesco~ [Salerno: Palladio, 1984], pp. 23-24)
points out that Francis was so concerned that his Rule would be
fraudulently emended that he encouraged his friars to memorize it.

	|127-141.~  For a helpful discussion of the participants of this second
circle of souls found in the heaven of the Sun, see Carmine Di Biase
(^Il Canto XII del "Paradiso"~ [Naples: Ermanno Cassitto 1992], pp.
71-83).  Comparing the two circles, Umberto Cosmo (^L'ultima ascesa:
Introduzione alla lettura del "Paradiso"~, ed. B. Maier [Florence: La
Nuova Italia, 1965 {1936}], pp. 106-7) argues that there is no sense of
rigid separation between the two, rather, in fact, that there are many
similarities between them.  Each has two representatives of the early
days of Christian thought (Isidore and Bede in the first group; Anselm
and Rabanus here) and two from the days of the origins (Boethius,
Orosius; Chrysostom, Donatus), and one from the Old Testament (Solomon;
Nathan).  Then there are masters of the ^Summa~ (Peter Lombard; Peter
Comestor) and mystics (Dionysius the Areopagite, Richard of St. Victor;
Hugh of St. Victor, Joachim of Flora).  Nearest the leaders (Thomas and
Bonaventure) are Albertus Magnus, Gratian; Illuminatus, Augustinus; and
then the culmination in those who do not seem easily acceptable to the
leaders at whose side they appear, Siger and Joachim.  (Cosmo's
tabulation somehow loses track of Peter Hispano and counts Joachim
twice.)

	|127-128.~  "St. Bonaventura was born at Bagnoregio (now Bagnorea) near
Orvieto in 1221, the year of St. Dominic's death.  As a child he was
attacked by a dangerous disease, which was miraculously cured by St.
Francis of Assisi.  When the latter heard that the child had recovered
he is said to have exclaimed 'buona ventura,' whereupon the boy's
mother changed his name to Bonaventura.  In 1238 or 1243 he entered the
Franciscan order.  After studying in Paris under Alexander of Hales, he
became successively professor of philosophy and theology, and in 1257
was made doctor.  Having risen to be general of the Franciscan order
(in 1257), he was offered the archbishopric of Albano by Gregory X,
whom he accompanied to the second Council of Lyons, where he died, July
15, 1274, 'his magnificent funeral being attended by a pope, an
emperor, and a king.'  St. Bonaventure was canonized in 1482 by Sixtus
IV, and placed among the doctors of the Church, with the title of
^Doctor Seraphicus~, by Sixtus V" (Toynbee, "Bonaventura" [^Concise
Dante Dictionary~]). The word ^vita~, used here by Bonaventure to
identify himself as a soul in grace, is used with this sense for the
second time in the poem (see the note to ^Par~. IX.7).

For Dante's debt to mysticism, as focused for him in the writings of
Bonaventure, see A.G. Meekins ("The Study of Dante, Bonaventure, and
Mysticism: Notes on Some Problems of Method," in ^In amicizia: Essays
in Honour of Giulio Lepschy~, ed. Z.G. Baranski and L. Pertile [The
Italianist 17 {1997--special supplement}], pp. 83-99).  For the
possibility that Dante read the apparent contradictions between the
positions of Aquinas and Bonaventure syncretistically, see Giuseppe
Mazzotta ("The Heaven of the Sun: Dante between Aquinas and
Bonaventure," in ^Dante for the New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda
Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New York: Fordham University Press,
2003], pp. 152-68) and Manuele Gragnolati (^Experiencing the Afterlife~
[Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 2005], pp. 58-77).  Paolo Di
Somma ("Canto III," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1986}], p. 50n.) argues for the
central importance of Bonaventure's ^Itinerarium mentis in Deum~ for
all of Dante's poem, not only for this canto.  A survey of
Bonaventure's presence in the Dartmouth Dante Project reveals that the
vast majority of references to "Bonaventura" before the end of the
nineteenth century occur only in notes to this canto, in which he is a
named (and thus inescapable) presence.  Perhaps we realize, after a few
minutes of reflection, that a serious use of Bonaventure's texts as a
guide to Dante's is a fairly recent development.  In fact, it is only
in Scartazzini's commentary that one finds a total of more references
to him in all the other cantos than one finds to him in this one.
After Scartazzini, that situation begins to change.  (English readers
will find that in this particular, as well as in others, John Carroll
outstrips his competitors.)  See Edward Hagman ("Dante's Vision of God:
The End of the ^Itinerarium Mentis~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988]: 1-20)
for a study of Bonaventure's extensive and overall importance to Dante.
 But see Sofia Vanni Rovighi, "Bonaventura da Bagnoreggio, santo," ^ED~
I (1970), p. 673, arguing that attempts to show a direct textual
dependence of Dante on Bonaventure have had only dubious results, that
all one can say is that his work (the ^Itinerarium mentis in Deum~ in
particular) is a generic model for the outline of the ^Comedy~, without
being able to make more of a claim for it than that.

	|129.~  The "left-hand care" reflects the traditional link between
left- and right-handedness as reflecting, respectively, "sinister" (the
Latin word for "left") and positive purposes.  The former here
signifies "worldly concerns."  Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 127-141)
does not attempt to banish cares of the world from the curate's
interest, but does say that he does not (and must not) treat them as
having the same importance as issues related to eternal life.

	|130.~  Illuminato and Augustino were among Francis's earliest
followers.  The first was a nobleman from Rieti and accompanied him on
his voyage to Egypt.  Augustino was a townsman of Francis and
eventually became head of a chapter of the Order in Terra di Lavoro.
Neither one of them is particularly associated with knowledge, which
causes Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 130-132) to wonder why these two
^homines ignorantes~ were included here.  He goes on to admire Dante's
subtlety in doing so, for they, if not great intellects themselves,
helped others to become, by their labor and example, more wise.

It was only in 1960 that a commentator on this verse (Mattalia),
responding to a number of Dantists who raised the issue, suggested that
a predictable reaction in one who is reading this line might very well
be: "But that's not Saint Augustine of Hippo; where is he in all this?"
 (And we have to wait for ^Paradiso~ XXXII.35 to find that he is indeed
among the blessed; see the note to that tercet.)  For the last time he
was named, see ^Paradiso~ X.120, but without mention of his eventual
fate.  Is it possible that Dante is playing a game with us?  He
mentions the actual St. Augustine two cantos ago, where we might have
expected to find him, among other theologians in the Sun; he now
mentions the name of a saved soul named "Augustine" who is not he but
who ^is~ here.  Both these gestures lead us to contemplate the
possibility that Dante is teasing us.  There will be some speculation
as to his reasons for doing so in a note to ^Paradiso~ XXXII.34-36, a
passage that situates Augustine among the inhabitants of the celestial
Rose.  Mattalia (comm. to verse 130) refers to the notion, which he
attributes to C. Landi, that Dante's hostility toward Augustine is a
reaction against the Bishop of Hippo's strong opposition to the
legitimacy of the state, a position that is not easily reconciled with
Dante's central agreement with the Aristotelian/Thomistic understanding
of the question, the ideological basis of those who sustained the
theocratic position.

	|132.~  See the note to ^Paradiso~ XI.87 for the ^capestro~ as signal
of adherence to the Franciscan Order.

	|133.~  "Hugh of St. Victor, celebrated mystic and theologian of the
beginning of cent. xii; he was born near Ypres in Flanders c. 1097 or,
as some believe, at Hartingham in Saxony, and was educated during his
early years in the monastery of Hammersleben near Halberstadt in
Saxony; in 1115 he removed to the abbey of St. Victor near Paris, which
had recently been founded by William of Champeaux, the preceptor of
Abelard, and which during cent. xii was a centre of mysticism; he
became one of the canons-regular of the abbey, and was in 1130
appointed to the chair of theology, which he held until his death in
1141, his reputation being so great that he was known as 'alter
Augustinus' [a second Augustine] and 'lingua Augustini' [Augustine's
tongue].  He was the intimate friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, and among
his pupils were Richard of St. Victor and Peter Lombard.  His writings,
which are very numerous, and are characterized by great learning, are
frequently quoted by Thomas Aquinas"; the most celebrated are the ^De
eruditione didascalica~, a sort of encyclopaedia of the sciences as
then understood, viewed in their relation to theology, the
^Institutiones monasticae~, including the treatises ^De arca morali~,
^De arca mystica~, and ^De vanitate mundi~; and the ^De sacramentis
Christianae fidei~, on the mysteries of the faith, comprising a
systematic exposition of Catholic theology; he also wrote commentaries
on various books of the Old and New Testament (with the latter of which
he appears to rank as of equal importance the canons, the decretals,
and the writings of the fathers), and upon the ^De caelesti hierarchia~
of Dionysius the Areopagite (Toynbee, "Ugo da San Vittore" [^Concise
Dante Dictionary~]).

	|134~.  Petrus Comestor (^comestor~ is the Latin word for "eater," and
was the nickname that Peter was given by his fellow priests because of
his tremendous appetite for books), "priest, and afterwards dean, of
the cathedral of Troyes in France, where he was born in the first half
of cent. xii; he became canon of St. Victor in 1164, and chancellor of
the University of Paris, and died at St. Victor in 1179, leaving all
his possessions to the poor.  His chief work was the ^Historia
scholastica~, which professed to be a history of the Church from the
beginning of the world down to the times of the apostles" (Toynbee,
"Pietro Mangiadore" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|134-135.~  "Petrus Hispanus (Pedro Juliani), born at Lisbon, c. 1225,
where he at first followed his father's profession of medicine; he
studied at Paris, probably under Albertus Magnus; subsequently he was
ordained and became (1273) archbishop of Braga; in 1274 he was created
cardinal bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) by Gregory X; on Sept. 13, 1276,
he was elected pope, under the title of John XXI, at Viterbo, in
succession to Adrian V; he died May 20, 1277, after a reign of a little
more than eight months, his death being caused by the fall of the
ceiling of one of the rooms in his palace at Viterbo" (Toynbee,
"Ispano, Pietro" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]). His manual of logic,
the ^Summulae logicales~, in twelve books, had a large audience.

That Dante calls no attention whatsoever to the fact that Peter was a
pope (if very briefly) has caught the attention of many commentators.
For the "scorecard" of the perhaps twelve popes who, in Dante's
opinion, were saved (and the probably larger number who were damned),
see the note to ^Inferno~ VII.46-48.  John XXI is the last saved pope
mentioned in the poem.

	|136.~  "Nathan, the prophet, who was sent by God to reprove David for
his sin in causing the death of Uriah the Hittite in order that he
might take Bathsheba to wife" (Toynbee, "Nat@an"[^Concise Dante
Dictionary~]).

For Nathan as ^figura Dantis~ and the question of why he, a relatively
minor prophet, is given such high relief in this poem, see G.R. Sarolli
(^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971]), pp.
189-246.  See also the note to verse 69.  And for a note that,
apparently written without awareness of Sarolli's previous work, makes
the venturesome claim that Dante thought of Nathan as "a Judaic Orpheus
or Thespis, the creator of an artistic mode," that he serves as "a
biblical model for Dante the story-teller," whose "handling of David is
an allegory of the moral and epistemological relevance of literature"
[i.e., telling truth to power indirectly, by means of a relevant
fiction], see Manfred Weidhorn ("Why Does Dante Cite Nathan in the
^Paradiso~?," ^Philological Quarterly~ 61 [1982]: 91).

	|136-137.~  "St. John Chrysostom (i.e., in Greek his name means
'golden-mouthed'), celebrated Greek father of the Church, born at
Antioch c. 345, died at Comana in Pontus, 407.  He belonged to a noble
family, and was first a lawyer; he afterward became a monk, in which
capacity he so distinguished himself by his preaching that the Emperor
Arcadius appointed him (in 398) patriarch of Constantinople.  His
severity toward the clergy in his desire for reform made him an object
of hatred to them, and led to his deposition (403) at the instance of
Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, and the Empress Eudoxia, whose
excesses he had publicly rebuked.  Sentence of exile was pronounced
against him, but the people, to whom he had endeared himself by his
preaching, rose in revolt, and he was reinstated in his office.
Shortly afterward, he was again banished (404), and he finally died in
exile on the shores of the Black Sea.  He left nearly 1,000 sermons or
homilies as evidence of his eloquence" (Toynbee, "Cris@ostomo"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|137.~  "Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, 1093-1109; he was born at
Aosta in Piedmont in 1033, and in 1060, at the age of 27, he became a
monk in the abbey of Bec in Normandy, whither he had been attracted by
the fame of Lanfranc, at that time prior; in 1063, on the promotion of
Lanfranc to the abbacy of Caen, he succeeded him as prior; fifteen
years later, in 1078, on the death of Herluin, the founder of the
monastery, he was made abbot, which office he held till 1093, in that
year he was appointed archbishop of Canterbury by William Rufus, in
succession to Lanfranc, after the see had been vacant for four years;
in 1097, in consequence of disputes with William on matters of
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, he left England for Rome to consult the
pope, and remained on the Continent until William's death in 1100, when
he was recalled by Henry I; he died at Canterbury, April 21, 1109;
canonized, in 1494, by Alexander VI."

"Anselm was the author of several theological works, the most important
of which are the ^Monologion~ (to which Anselm gave the subtitle
^Exemplum meditandi de ratione fidei~), the ^Proslogion~ (^Fides
quaerens intellectum~), and the ^Cur Deus homo~ (a treatise on the
atonement intended to prove the necessity of the incarnation)"
(Toynbee, "Anselmo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|137-138.~  "Aelius Donatus, Roman scholar and rhetorician of cent. iv,
said to have been the tutor of Jerome; he was the author of a
commentary on Virgil (now lost, but often alluded to by Servius), and
of another on Terence, but his most famous work was an elementary Latin
grammar, ^Ars Grammatica~ in three books; part of this work, the ^Ars
minor~, or ^De octo partibus orationis~, served as a model for
subsequent similar treatises.  Owing to the popularity of this work in
the Middle Ages it was one of the earliest books, being printed even
before the invention of movable type -- the name of its author became a
synonym for grammar, just as Euclid for geometry" (Toynbee, "Donato"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

Donatus was the "people's grammarian" in that his ^Ars~, unlike
Priscian's (see ^Inf~. XV.109), supposedly kept grammar as simple as
possible.  And grammar was itself the "first art" in the sense that it
was the first subject taught to children, the first of the seven
liberal arts.  Thus his "intellectual humility" may have, in Dante's
mind, paralleled that of Illuminato and Augustino.  Both the Ottimo
(comm. to these verses) and John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 136-138)
cite the ^incipit~ of the work: "Ianua sum rudibus" (I am the doorway
through which the unlettered may pass [to learning]).

	|139.~  Rabanus Maurus was "born at Mainz of noble parents, c. 776;
while quite a youth he entered the monastery at Fulda, where he
received deacon's orders in 801; he shortly after proceeded to Tours to
study under Alcuin, who in recognition of his piety and diligence gave
him the surname of Maurus, after St. Maurus (d. 565), the favourite
disciple of St. Benedict.  He was ordained priest in 814, and after a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land returned to Fulda in 817, where he became
abbot in 822.  He held this office for twenty years until 842, when he
retired in order to devote himself more completely to religion and
literature.  Five years later, however, he was appointed to the
archbishopric of Mainz, which he held until his death in 856.  Rabanus,
who was considered one of the most learned men of his time, wrote a
voluminous commentary on the greater portion of the Bible, and was the
author of numerous theological works..., the most important being the
^De institutione clericorum~.  His treatise ^De laudibus Sanctae
Crucis~ contains figures in which rows of letters are cut by outlines
of stars, crosses, and the like, so as to mark out words and sentences.
 Butler suggests that Dante may have borrowed thence the idea of his
image in [^Par~. XVIII.91], where he represents the spirits as
arranging themselves in the shape of letters to form the words
'Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terram'" (Toynbee, "Rabano" [^Concise
Dante Dictionary~]).  And see Nicol@o Mineo, "Rabano Mauro," ^ED~ IV
(1973), pp. 817-18.  While Mineo insists that a careful study of the
extent of Dante's knowledge of Rabanus has yet to be undertaken, he
does indicate some points of contact between Dante and at least
Rabanus's commentary on Ezechiel, his ^De Universo~, and his ^Liber de
Cruce~.  Most are content with the traditional identification of the
ninth-century biblical commentator; however, for the view that this
Rabanus is not Maurus but Anglicus, see Robert E. Lerner ("On the
Origins of the Earliest Latin Pope Prophecies: A Reconsideration,"
^Monumenta Germaniae Historica~ 33, Teil V [1988], pp. 631-32).  Lerner
did not have access to the DDP for a study of the identity of "Rabanus"
among Dante's commentators, but would have found support for his thesis
among some important early discussants, the Ottimo (comm. to this
verse); Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 139-141), who adds that he was a
brother of the Venerable Bede; John of Serravalle (comm. to vv.
139-141), following (as he often did) his ^magister~, Benvenuto;
Landino (comm. to vv. 139-141); and Vellutello (comm. to vv. 139-141).
Among the early commentators only Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv.
127-141) refers to the Rabanus we routinely think was in Dante's mind.
That modern tradition began in 1732 with Venturi (comm. to this verse).
 Lombardi (comm. to vv. 139-141), who delighted in disagreeing with
Venturi, for once is in accord with him, and says as much.  While
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 139-141) is a rare modern even to refer to
Bede's brother as an alternative possibility, all but one of the
post-Renaissance commentators back Rabanus Maurus, and very few even
mention that there has been another candidate.  Scartazzini (comm. to
this verse) mentions the lack of awareness of the German Rabanus among
the early commentators and cites the presence of the English one in
their work, but does not treat their opinion as being worthy of serious
study.  Finally Campi (comm. to vv. 139-141) does not bat an eyelash
when, out of the blue, he says that Rabanus was Bede's brother and does
not even mention Rabanus Maurus; but he is apparently absolutely alone
in the last one hundred and ten years (until Lerner came along) in
thinking so.

	|140-141.~   Joachim of Flora "appears to have enjoyed in his own day,
and long afterwards, a reputation for prophetic power; hence
Bonaventure speaks of him as 'di spirito profetico dotato,' words which
are said to be taken verbatim from the anthem still chanted on the
Festival of St. Joachim in the churches of Calabria.

"Joachim was born c. 1145 at Celico, about 4 miles NE. of Cosenza in
Calabria.  He made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and on his return to
Italy became a monk, entering (c. 1158) the Cistercian monastery of
Sambucina.  In 1177 he was made abbot of Corazzo in Calabria.  In 1185,
Pope Urban III appointed a deputy abbot in order that Joachim might
have leisure to devote himself to his writings.  In 1189 Joachim
founded a monastery, San Giovanni in Fiore in the forest of the Sila
among the mountains of Calabria, whence he was named 'de Floris.'  From
this institution, the rule of which was sanctioned by Celestine III in
1196, ultimately sprang the so-called Ordo Florensis (absorbed by the
Cistercians, 1505).  Joachim died c. 1202.  The authenticated works of
Joachim: a commentary upon the Apocalypse (^Expositio in Apocalypsin~),
a Harmony of the Old and New Testaments (^Concordia veteris et novi
Testamenti~), the ^Psalterium decem chordarum~, and the ^Contra
Judaeos~.  Many works have been attributed to him -- among them, the
^Liber figurarum~, the authorship of which is much debated [if, since
the work of Leone Tondelli (^Il libro delle figure dell'abate Gioachino
da Fiore~ [Turin: SEI, 1940]), it has mainly been accepted as genuine].
 He was credited with the authorship of a book on the popes, in which
the persons and names of all the future popes were described" (Toynbee,
"Giovacchino" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

On Dante's relationships with Joachim's work and various of its
followers see Antoine Calvet ("Dante et les joachimismes," in ^Pour
Dante: Dante et l'Apocalypse: Lectures humanistes de Dante~, ed. Bruno
Pinchard and Christian Trottmann [Paris: Champion, 2001], pp. 77-98).
And see Bruno Nardi ("Dante e Gioacchino da Fiore," in his ^"Lecturae"
e altri studi danteschi~, ed. Rudy Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1990
{1965}], pp. 277-331).  For a more recent study, see Alessandro
Ghisalberti ("Canto XII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp.
187-90).

Marco Veglia ("Per un'ardita umilt@a.  L'averroismo di Dante tra Guido
Cavalcanti, Sigieri di Brabante e San Francesco d'Assisi," ^Schede
Umanistiche~ 1 [2000]: 71) points out that Averro,es (^Inf~. IV.144),
Siger (^Par~. X.136), and Joachim is each the last figure in a group
(fortieth, twelfth, and twelfth, respectively); they have in common the
surprise generated by their presence in these groups.

Rather than attempting, as some do, to "Franciscanize" this second
circle in the Sun (while "Dominicanizing" the first in Canto X), Steven
Botterill ("^Paradiso~ XII," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [Lectura Dantis
{virginiana}, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995], p. 184) speaks of (and he is also referring to the
first circle, seen in ^Par~. X) the "images of celebration,
reconciliation, and harmony" that typify this entire heaven.

	|142.~  There has been dispute over the reference of ^paladino~, but
most today seem content to believe that it refers to Dominic, rather
than to Francis, Thomas, or Joachim.  See Mario Scotti ("Canto XII," in
^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: "Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples:
Loffredo, 2000 {1987}],  p. 257n.).

On the verb ^inveggiar~, see Singleton (comm. to this verse): "The most
plausible interpretation would seem to be that ^inveggiar~, deriving
from ^invidiare~, to envy, would mean (as does its Proven$cal
equivalent ^envejar~) to envy in a good sense, hence to praise."

For a review of both questions (the meaning of the verb and the
reference of the noun), accompanied by an attempt to make related sense
of them by denying an emergent consensus, see Porena (comm. to vv.
142-145).  But for the paladin who rides out to re-establish that
consensus, see Mattalia (comm. to verse 142).  For a similar result,
see the review offered by Giacalone (comm. to vv. 142-143).

	|143-145.~  It has long been observed that Dante constructed these two
cantos so as to make them reflect one another in a thoroughgoing way.
See the chart offered by Bosco/Reggio (who at times seem to be forcing
the details to fit) for the parallel elements in Cantos XI and XII
(numbers in parentheses refer to the number of ^terzine~ dedicated to
each subject; square brackets contain one element not included in their
table):

\<pre\>
						^Canto XI		Canto XII~
General introduction:				28-36 (3) 		37-45 (3)
Actions performed by the two saints:		40-42 (1) 		34-36 (1)
Place of birth:					43-51 (3) 		46-54 (3)
Birth:						49-51 (1) 		55-57 (1)
[Saint's Life:					55-117 (21)		58-105 (16)]
Transition from biography to condemnation: 	118-123 (2) 		106-111 (2)
Condemnation of his own Order: 			124-129 (2) 		112-117 (2)
Faithful friars: 				130-132 (1) 		121-123 (1)
\</pre\>

For a nearly identical table, without reference to any source, see
Alessandro Ghisalberti ("Canto XII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], p. 182n.).

	|143.~  For the several elements that inform Dante's notion of
courtesy, see Andrea Fass@o ("La cortesia di Dante," in ^Filologia
Romanza e cultura medievale: studi in onore di Elio Melli~, ed. A.
Fass@o, L. Formisano, and M. Mancini [Alessandria: Edizioni dell'Orso,
1998], vol. I, pp. 279-301).

	|144.~  Ettore Bonora ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1987}], pp.
281-83) discusses the phrase describing Aquinas's speech as "discreto
latin" and says that it is obvious that Thomas is not speaking Latin,
but using Latin stylistic devices (in the ^lingua franca~ of the poem,
Italian) that ennoble speech.  (And it should be pointed out that Dante
several times uses the word ^latino~ to indicate either the Italian
language or "Italy" itself.  See the note to ^Inf~. XXII.64-66, the
passage in which it first appears; and see the note to ^Par~.
XVII.34-35, its last appearance in the poem.)   For the connection
between this descriptor, the adjective ^discreto~, and, in Dante's
formulations, Thomas's "stress on the need to make distinctions," see
Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992)], pp. 203-6), citing
Kenelm Foster and Ettore Bonora.
