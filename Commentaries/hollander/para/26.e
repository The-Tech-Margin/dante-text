	|1.~  As a continuation of its predecessor, this canto begins with
Dante's concerns about his blindness.  The verb ^dubbiava~ underlines
the combination of fear and uncertainty that he is experiencing, as
Sapegno (comm. to vv. 1-2) points out (citing Francesco da Buti [comm.
to vv. 1-12]); he reflects on some of the previous and varying meanings
of the verb ^dubbiare~ (^Inf~. IV.18 and ^Purg~. XX.135: being fearful;
^Purg~. III.72: being dubious).

	|3.~  For the noun ^spiro~, see ^Paradiso~ XXIV.32, where it refers to
Peter's "breath" (and see the related verb ^[spir@o]~ at XXIV.82; and
XXV.82, with similar significance for James as well).  Thus each
apostle is identified with the word connected to the spiration of the
Holy Spirit; it is probably not accidental that all three of them are
associated with this spiration in ^Paradiso~ XXV.132.

	|4.~  The verb ^risensarsi~ (to get back any one of one's [lost]
senses) is probably a Dantean invention, as Isidoro del Lungo (comm. to
vv. 4-6) suggests.

	|5-6.~  These lines bring back to mind a similar tactic on the part of
Virgil (^Inferno~ XI.10-15), where Dante's olfactory sense must be
rested from the infernal stench before the downward journey into the
pit may be continued; therefore, Virgil, in order to pass the time
profitably, offers his "lecture" on the order of the sins.  Here, in
response to Dante's temporary blindness, John will use the time to give
Dante his examination on Love, which begins with the next tercet.

	|6.~  Aversano (^Dante daccapo~ [glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia
d'eccezione~, sent by the author on 11 September 2001), p. 121, points
out that here the verb ^ragionare~, so intimately connected with the
phrase ^d'amore~ (and thus "to speak of love") in Dante's own and other
amorous lyrics, here is put to the service of discussing a higher form
of love, the third (and highest) of the three theological virtues (see
Paul's statement to that effect [that among faith, hope, and love, "the
greatest of these is love"] in I Corinthians 13:13).  (The verb is
repeated in verse 21.)

At the same time, it is necessary to keep in mind, as Scartazzini
(comm. to vv. 1-18) reminds us, citing Thomas (^ST~ I-II, q. 65, a. 5),
the necessary relations among Charity, Faith, and Hope.  We may be
tempted to conclude that, like the Persons of the Trinity, the presence
of one of them implies the presence of both the other two.

	|9-12.~  The protagonist's blindness, John assures him, is but
temporary.  For the reference, see Acts 9:10-18, where Ananias, a
disciple of Christ, is sent to cure Saul of his blindness.  Once he
does so, Paul begins to preach Jesus Christ.  This is thus the pivotal
moment in the life of Saul/Paul.  While Beatrice, bringing back Dante's
sight, is thus Ananias-like, there is much less at stake here, and the
comparison may seem at least a bit overblown.  James Gaffney ("Dante's
Blindness in ^Paradiso~ XXV-XXVI: An Allegorical Interpretation,"
^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973]: 101-12) argues that Dante abandons Thomistic
precepts here and turns to the Platonic-Augustinian tradition,
particularly as available in Saint Bonaventure's ^Itinerarium mentis in
Deum~.  This, according to Gaffney, represents a further stage in his
spiritual progress, a stage corresponding to the second category of
contemplation, of "what is within the soul," according to Bonaventure's
distinctions.  His vision restored and spiritually re-directed, the
Pilgrim eventually enters the third category of contemplation, that
"above the soul."

	|9.~  The past participle, ^smarrita~, of the verb ^smarrire~ (to
confuse, discourage, bewilder) is used to suggest Dante's inner state
in ^Inferno~ I.3, II.64, V.72, X.125, and XIII.24 (see the note to
^Inf~. X.125).  In most of those situations, the protagonist felt
sympathy for the damned.  Here, in the penultimate occurrence of the
word to indicate his inner state, his loss of the faculty of vision is
not the result of his sinfulness, but represents only a temporary
failing (a result of his remaining tendency to see with carnal eyes?)
in his increasing capacity to understand things divine.  A final
occurrence of the verb to indicate that condition awaits (^Par~.
XXXIII.77); there it will refer to a rather different (and loftier)
"confusion" on the protagonist's part.

	|13-15.~  Giovanni Getto ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera:
"Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968], p. 933)
has observed that this canto enters into an intimate relationship with
the ^Vita nuova~ (see also Kevin Brownlee, "^Paradiso~ XXVI," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995 {1990}], p. 390).  And
these verses, more pointedly than most in this ^cantica~ dedicated to
Dante's love for Beatrice, recall the physical basis of Dante's first
desires for her (and one also refers to the even clearer sexual
reference of that Virgilian reminiscence found in a similar moment,
^Purg~. XXX.46-48, equating Beatrice and Dido).  The language here is
unmistakably reminiscent of the language of sexual desire found in
Dante's lyrics (and in those of other poets).  Reassembling arguments
made in her three previous essays in this vein, Regina Psaki ("Love for
Beatrice: Transcending Contradiction in the ^Paradiso~," in ^Dante for
the New Millennium~, ed. Teodolinda Barolini and H. Wayne Storey [New
York: Fordham University Press, 2003], pp. 115-30) argues that Dante's
heavenly love for Beatrice conflates that early form of love in his
present one.  Opponents of this view are accused of "cultural
nervousness about the notion that sexual love may be sacred" (p. 119).
Nonetheless, it is difficult to believe that Dante wants his reader to
think that the old flame still burns beneath angelic clothing; and it
is still more difficult to believe that, at least within the confines
of the ^Comedy~, he would consider any form of extramarital sexual love
"sacred."

	|16-18.~  Dante's answer is simple (at least it seems so at first).
Love "reads" instruction to him, as might a professor at the Sorbonne.
The poet's word ^leggere~ refers to the practice of instruction in
theology from which the word "lecture" derives (for a previous use, see
^Par~. X.137); see Poletto (comm. to ^Par~. X.136-138).  Dante's heart
is instructed by the Holy Spirit to love God.

The problem for the reader results from the phrasing of the thought
"whatever scripture Love teaches me in loud or gentle tones."  Since
the precise meaning of this tercet is much contested, there are many
instances of commentators who outdo themselves in improbable readings
(for a review, see Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 17-18]; his own attempt,
however, leaves much to be desired with respect to the last four words
^[o lievemente o forte]~).  To characterize them with the words of
Origen, hurling invective at those copyists of the Gospels who twisted
the sense of the text in order to arrive at a meaning of which they
approved, such commentators are guilty of "perverse audacity" (see Bart
D. Ehrman [^Misquoting Jesus~ {San Francisco: Harper, 2005}], p. 52).
For an instance of exactly such critical behavior with regard to this
tercet, see Karlheinz Stierle ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2002], pp. 406-7); he attempts to relate the Amore
who "reads" to Dante here to Paolo and Francesca reading the voice of
Amore in ^Inferno~ V; his argument concludes with the detail (which is
obviously intended as a final flourish): ^alfa~ and ^o~ are the
"determinative vowels" of their names: Pa^o~l^o~ and Fr^a~ncesc^a~.
However, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-18): "Much difficulty is made of
these words, but the meaning is quite simple: 'God is the beginning and
the end of all my love.'  The figurative form is taken from the Alpha
and Omega of Revelation 1:8: God is the entire alphabet of the sacred
writings which love reads to his soul -- the scripture of the universe.
 Many meanings are suggested for '^o lievemente o forte~,' 'with light
voice or strong': such as reason and revelation, or human and Divine
love, or God loved for Himself and for His benefits.  Dante's own words
which follow seem to me to give the answer.  The ^loud~ voice
corresponds to the arguments of Philosophy and the assurance of
Revelation in ll. 25-45; and the ^low~ voice to the secondary causes of
love in ll. 55-66.  But whether low or loud, God is the one and only
object of love."  Daniello (comm. to this tercet) had offered a
somewhat similar observation: God commands us to love first of all
Himself and then His creatures.  For a different view, see Benvenuto
(comm. to this tercet), interpreting "lievemente o forte" as "easy or
difficult," a view accepted by Simone Marchesi ("A Rhetoric of Faith:
Dante's Poetics in the Transition from ^De vulgari eloquentia~ to the
^Commedia~" [Doctoral dissertation, Princeton University, 2002]).

For "Alfa ed O" Dante is of course citing John's own words (Apoc. 1:8,
21:6, 22:13), as he has already done in the ^Epistle to Cangrande~
(XIII.90): "And since, when the Beginning or First, which is God, has
been reached, there is nought to be sought for beyond, inasmuch as He
is Alpha and Omega ^[Alfa et O]~, that is, the Beginning and the End,
as the Vision of John tells us, the work ends in God Himself, who is
blessed for evermore, world without end" (tr. P. Toynbee).

See vv. 40-42, where he has John quote Exodus 33:19, another evident
biblical citation in the canto.  Thus he intrinsically presents himself
as citing himself (from his own epistle) citing John (in the
Apocalypse), while he presents John as citing Moses.  John, at least,
shows a certain amount of authorial modesty.

	|16.~  For "lo ben" (the good), see ^Inferno~ III.18, "il ben
dell'intelletto" (the good of the intellect), or, as most commentators
agree, God.

	|17.~  For some bibliography dealing with this verse, see Sebastiano
Valerio ("Lingua, retorica e poetica nel canto XXVI del ^Paradiso~,"
^L'Alighieri~ 22 [2003], p. 98, n. 65), citing not only Nardi's
discussion ("Perch$e 'Alfa ed O' e non 'Alfa ed Omega' [Nota a ^Par~.
XXVI, 17]," in his ^Saggi e note di critica dantesca~ [Milan-Naples:
Ricciardi, 1966 {1964}], pp. 317-20) but three studies by Del Popolo
from the 1990s.  Nardi demonstrated that the reading he had grown up
with ("Alfa ed Omega") is metrically impossible.

	|18-62.~  Surpassing even ^Inferno~ V, where it appeared ten times in
68 lines, the word ^amor~ has its most dense occurrence in the
^Commedia~ here, seven times in forty-five lines.  Other notably
^amor~-filled passages occur in ^Purgatorio~ XVII.85-136, a total of
eight occurrences in 52 lines; XVIII.14-104, nine occurrences in 91.
See the note to ^Paradiso~ XV.12.

	|21.~  The words ^mi mise in cura~ (made me hesitate) are not
understood by everyone in the same way, with some believing that they
mean "gave me a reason," an opinion that we do not share.

	|22-24.~  John asks the protagonist to go down to a second level in his
disquisition on this theological virtue, to put his answer through a
"finer sieve."  However, and as Singleton (comm. to vv. 1-79) points
out, "no definition of love is given in the examination, as it is with
faith and hope.  This serves to stress the fact that love is primarily
a matter of the will, not of the intellect.  Dante is simply asked
^what~ he loves, and why."

	|25-27.~  Dante replies briefly but thoroughly, refining his first
response (vv. 13-18).  Love is imprinted in him by two agents,
philosophical arguments and "authority," or, in a shorthand of sorts,
Aristotle and the Bible.

	|28-36.~  For the gist of these tercets, see Tozer's paraphrase: "The
argument derived from Reason is this: -- That which is good awakens
love in the soul of him who understands its nature, and the love
increases in proportion as the goodness is greater.  Consequently, the
Being who is perfect goodness must attract more love than any other
object."

	|37-39.~  To whom does Dante refer here?  Aristotle is the nearly
unanimous opinion of the commentators, who are divided only about the
precise passage, whether in the ^Metaphysics~, the ^Ethics~, or ^On
Causes~ (attributed to Aristotle during the Middle Ages), explaining
how the spheres' love for the godhead set the universe into motion.

	|40-45.~  Dante now adduces two texts in evidence, the first plainly
identifiable.  It reports that God says to Moses (Exod. 33:19), "Ego
ostendam omne bonum tibi" (I will make all My goodness pass before
you).  Perhaps the first commentator to deal with the context of this
passage was Vellutello (comm. to vv. 40-42), noting that it continues
by having God reveal to Moses only His "back parts," not His face.
Apparently he was the only commentator to do so before Carroll, whose
discussion is informative (comm. to vv. 19-45): "It seems to me
difficult to believe that Dante, when quoting this, did not remember
that God proceeds to say: 'Thou canst not see my face: for there shall
no man see me and live....  Thou shalt see my back parts: but my face
shall not be seen.'  And, as I understand it, the passage which he
takes from the New Testament is chosen just because it is the
fulfillment of the imperfect revelation given to Moses."  Then Carroll
turns to the less clearly identified source: "It is taken from St.
John's writings, the particular reference being much disputed....
Dante is thinking of all [of John's writings] as ^one~ proclamation of
the secret of heaven to earth; and if so, 'the ^beginning~ of the high
heralding' is the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel.  Now it happens that
the closing words of the Prologue allude to this very fulfillment of
the imperfect revelation through Moses of which I have spoken: 'The law
was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.  No man hath
seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
the Father, he hath declared him.'  The evident connection of this with
the passage quoted from Moses seems to me conclusive.  Moses saw the
back of God; Christ reveals the 'secret' of heaven -- the bosom of the
Father [...].  [W]hat Dante wants is a passage of Scripture in proof
that God has revealed himself as the supreme object of the love of man,
and that is certainly not absent from the Prologue; it is indeed
specially emphasized in verse 18 to which I refer.  I lay stress on two
points: (1) Dante is not singling out ^one~ of John's writings -- they
all constitute the highest proclamation of the secret of heaven; (2)
the connection, to my mind very obvious, between Exodus 32:19-23 and
John 1:17-18.  It is perhaps not a mere fancy to find some slight
corroboration of this interpretation in the word '^grida~' of l. 44 --
'the high heralding which ^cries~ the secret' of heaven -- an echo of
John 1:15, where it is written that Christ's herald 'John bare witness
and ^cried~, saying, This was he,' etc."

	|42.~  For Guido Cavalcanti's version of this statement, see ^Vita
Nuova~ (III.14): "Vedeste, al mio parere, onne valore" (I think that
you beheld all worth -- tr. M. Musa),  as cited by Sebastiano Valerio
("Lingua, retorica e poetica nel canto XXVI del ^Paradiso~,"
^L'Alighieri~ 22 [2003], pp. 90-91).  And see the discussion of Exodus
33:19 in the note to vv. 40-45.

	|44.~  The word ^preconio~ (proclamation, message) and the word
^arcano~ (mystery) is each a hapax.  Benvenuto begins the understanding
that this ^preconio~ is the opening verse of John's Gospel, "In the
beginning was the Word."  However, and as Scartazzini (comm. to this
verse) argues, most of the ancient commentators are of the opinion that
the Apocalypse is on Dante's mind here; he follows them.  It would have
been hard to oppose the combined authority of Benvenuto and
Scartazzini; the former's judgment (supported, as it was in this
particular, by that of Francesco da Buti) should perhaps have weighed
more heavily with the latter.  More recently, Brenda Deen Schildgen
(^Dante and the Orient~ [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2002])
takes a wider approach in trying to locate the passage in biblical
exegesis.

	|46-48.~  John accepts Dante's answer.  Depending on whether the verb
^guarda~ is to be taken as a present indicative (as we translate it) or
as an imperative strongly influences one's understanding of the tercet.
 See, ^inter alia~, discussions in Scartazzini (comm. to verse 44),
brusquely dismissive (if perhaps rightly so) of those who decide for
the imperative, and Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 44), more balanced in
keeping the options open.

	|49-51.~  John now sets his third question for the protagonist,
involving the subjects of what draws him (by pulling him with ^corde~
[cords]) and what goads him (by bites of its ^denti~ [teeth]) toward
God.  The reader may be reminded of the stimuli on the seven terraces
of the purgatorial mountain, which featured (see, e.g., ^Purg~.
XIV.147) ^freno~ or ^richiamo~ ("curb" or "lure").  In ^Paradiso~
XXVIII.12, Beatrice's eyes will be presented as the "cord" (in the
sense of "noose") that captured him.

In response to Venturi's complaint against the bitterness of Dante's
metaphor for such a sweet feeling (love), Lombardi (comm. to verse 51)
points out that Dante has always used harsh metaphors for love
(presented as burning, wounding, etc.).

	|53.~  The authors of the Gospels were portrayed as four different
creatures, the "four living creatures" of Apocalypse 4:7: Matthew as
man, Mark as lion, Luke as ox, John as eagle.

	|55-66.~  Carroll (comm. to vv. 46-63) continues his global explanation
of this passage: "But [John's] examination is not finished.  'The Eagle
of Christ' pursues the subject into its secondary causes.  We come at
this point to the scripture which Love reads with a ^low~ voice (l. 18)
-- the collateral and subsidiary sources of charity, or as John puts
it, the cords that draw, and the teeth that bite into the heart."  And
then, interpreting the verses 58-60, Carroll concludes: "In other
words, the creation of the world and man, the cross of Christ, and the
hope of glory: these are 'the teeth' with which the love of God bites
into his heart, for all are operations of that love.  Yet it is to be
noted that they are not 'the interior act of charity,' the clinging of
the soul to God, but only cords to draw men to the act."

	|62-63.~  Once more Dante turns to the large motif of the exodus to
express his personal journey from sin to redemption.  See the previous
uses of ^pelago~ (^Inf~. I.23 and ^Par~. II.5).

	|64-66.~  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 65) was apparently the first (and
still among the few) to see that Dante was again resorting to the text
of John's Gospel (John 15:1): "Ego sum vitis vera et Pater meus
agricola est" (I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser).
See also Singleton (comm. to this tercet), Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this
tercet), and Giovanni Getto ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
p. 941).  It is also true that none of these cites Scartazzini, or
indeed anyone else.

	|67-69.~  See Giovanni Getto ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera: "Paradiso"~, dir. M. Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1968],
pp. 942-43), discussing Dante's formula for concluding the apostles'
examinations of him on the three theological virtues.  These occur at
^Paradiso~ XXIV.112-114, XXV.97-99, and in these verses.  Getto finds
the three texts sharing the following earmarks: each passage (1) is
contained in no more or no less than a single ^terzina~; (2) contains
reference to Dante's completion of his utterance; (3) cites the opening
words of the celebrative song raised at its conclusion; (4) includes
some description of the quality of that song; (5) refers to those who
sang it.

Once again we find a Latin hymn (the ^Sanctus~), which had become a
part of the liturgy,  performed in Italian ("Holy, holy, holy").  See
the note to ^Paradiso~ XXIV.113-114.  The original ^Sanctus~ is found
in both Isaiah 6:3 and Apocalypse 4:8 (where it follows the description
of the "four living creatures" [see the note to verse 53]).

	|70-79.~  This simile portrays Dante/Saul becoming Dante/Paul as a
result of the ministrations of Beatrice, who restores his temporarily
vanquished sight.  See the note to vv. 9-12.

	|70-75.~  Dante seems to have been fascinated by the processes both of
falling to sleep and of awakening from it.  Is there another work from
this period that has more frequent or more detailed references to both?
 See, for example, ^Inferno~ I.111, III.136, XXV.90, XXX.136-141,
XXXIII.38; ^Purgatorio~ IX.11, IX.33-42, IX.63, XV.119-123, XVII.40-42,
XVIII.87-88, XVIII.143-145, XXVII.92, XXVII.113, XXXII.64-69;
XXXII.76-78; ^Paradiso~ XXXII.139.  With respect to the challenge he
offers (^Purg~. XXXII.69) to those who would do the impossible and
portray falling to sleep, he himself does imposingly well.

See Patrick Boyde (^Perception and passion in Dante's "Comedy"~
[Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1993],  pp.74-75) for an analysis of the
"mechanics" of seeing in these six lines.

	|73.~  The verb ^ab[b]or[r]ire~ (or, as we believe, ^ab[b]or[r]are~) --
and both forms (along with others, as well) are found with
orthographical variants in the interpretive tradition -- has caused a
great deal of puzzlement.  See Gino Casagrande ("Parole di Dante:
'abborrare,'" ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 {1997}]: 177-90) for a
thorough study of the history of the problem, concluding that (1) the
verb is nearly certainly the first conjugation one, used by Dante twice
in ^Inferno~ (XXV.144; XXXI.24); (2) it probably, on the basis of
observations found in Uguccione da Pisa, derives from a Latin synonym
for ^balbus~ (not speaking clearly [see ^Purg~. XIX.7 and ^Par~.
XXVII.130 and 133]) and here means "loses the power of speech."
Casagrande, following Porena (comm. to vv. 73-75), treats the form of
the verb here as metaplasmic, that is, believing that Dante, his hand
forced by the exigencies of rhyme, has switched conjugational endings
^(-ire)~ for ^(-are)~.  Our translation accepts the basic
interpretation of Porena (as restated by Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv.
73-75]) -- but does not accept the new reading proposed by Casagrande,
for the reason that the action resulting from Beatrice's intervention
is not that the protagonist can speak clearly so much as it is that he
can ^see better~ (see verse 79).  Since what is revealed as the object
of his eventually clear vision is still another soul, it would seem
reasonable to argue that what at first appears unclear to the
protagonist is that "fourth light," what turns out to be the radiance
of Adam.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 73-75) also follow Porena, but
keep the sense of the verb as "confound" (a matter of not seeing
clearly), a view that Casagrande does not accept.

	|76.~  For the word ^quisquilia~, a hapax in Dante, see Amos 8:6, where
it is a hapax in the Bible, indicating the chaff from grain.

	|80-81.~  The totally unexpected "fourth light," we habitual readers
realize, without surprise, is Adam.  If we remember our first reading,
we probably recall our amazement at what Dante (who reports himself
"stupefatto" [dazed]) has done, putting the first father before us for
an interview about Edenic existence.

	|80.~  For the word ^stupefatto~, see Aversano (^Dante daccapo~
[glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on
11 September 2001), p. 125, citing Acts 9:7, all the more plausible as
a reference, given the Pauline context of the canto (introduced at vv.
10-12).  "The men who were traveling with him [Saul] stood speechless
^[stupefacti]~, hearing the voice but seeing no one."  Jesus,
invisible, has called Saul to Him.  Saul rises from the ground blind
and is led by the hand by his fellow travelers into Damascus, where he
will be cured of his blindness as the new man, Paul, by Ananias.

	|82-84.~  The theological dimensions of this tercet are large indeed:
God the Father created all things and then Adam, who gazes up at his
maker with the love sponsored by the Holy Spirit.  That love is made
manifest in turn by the redemptive act of Christ, who has saved fallen
Adam and some of those who were born in his sinfulness.

	|85-90.~  This is an at least somewhat puzzling simile, equating
Beatrice with a gust of wind, forcing the top of a tree down from its
normal inclination upward.  It then goes on to equate Dante with that
treetop, regaining its natural upward direction once the gust has blown
itself out.  The meaning is plain, but the negative associations that
surround Beatrice seem strange; nonetheless, the positive ones that
accompany Dante's desires to do something of which Beatrice approves
eventually govern our understanding.

	|91-92.~  Adam was, by tradition, thought to have been created by God
as though he were thirty or (more usually) thirty-three years old (thus
matching the years of Christ on earth).  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 91-93)
remarks that the protagonist's phrasing is not very kind, since it
brings to Adam's mind the appetite (for the apple) that caused his fall.

On this passage see Christian Moevs (^The Metaphysics of Dante's
"Comedy"~[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005], pp. 101-2),
distinguishing between Adam as indeed ripe in himself, as he was made
by God (and now again is), and the creature he had mistakenly thought
he could improve by opposing God's will and stealing His forbidden
fruit.

	|93.~  Every bride is both Adam's daughter and his daughter-in-law.  Of
course, the same holds true for grooms, if with genders exchanged.  See
Carroll (comm. to vv. 88-96), explaining that this verse is "an echo of
St. Augustine's ^City of God~, XV.16: '^Father~ and ^father-in-law~ are
the names of two relationships....  But Adam in his single person was
obliged to hold both relations to his sons and daughters, for brothers
and sisters were united in marriage.  So too Eve his wife was both
mother and mother-in-law to her children of both sexes.'"

	|95-96.~  The poet (and protagonist) play with the convention
established and embellished as we proceed through the last canticle:
Souls in Heaven read the thoughts of others in the mind of God.  That
being true, the protagonist acknowledges, an unvoiced question begets
its answer more rapidly, avoiding the time otherwise lost in verbal
duplication.  Adam himself will underline this point at some length
(vv. 103-108).

	|97.~  This line has caused confusion, even anger, and (perhaps
consequently) flights of fancy.  It was only with Lombardi (comm. to
vv. 97-102) that a commentator disagreed with the earlier commentators'
assumption that the covering was the creature's own fur.  Now almost
all agree that the imagined animal is covered (if for a reason not
readily discerned) with a cloth of some kind.  (Porena [comm. to vv.
97-99] would eventually draw on a childhood experience, when he once
carried a cat in a sack, to suggest that Dante was referring to a
similarly ensacked feline.)  Torraca (comm. to vv. 97-102) suggests the
possible reference to a caparisoned horse (if P$ezard mainly receives
the credit for Torraca's in fact earlier observation), but then wisely
backs away from making any definite identification; he continues by
reminding us of the highly similar similetic moment in ^Paradiso~
VIII.52-54, in which Dante compares the glad soul of Charles Martel to
a silkworm clothed in its own glowing light.  (And see the earlier and
altogether similar appreciation of Poletto [comm. to vv. 97-102].)
This, one thinks, is assuredly the model for any attempt at an
interpretation; however, it is rare that the verse has been considered
in its light.

If one wanted to crown a particular exercise for its fervid
imagination, one might well favor Daniello's opinion (comm. to vv.
97-102) that the image finds a precursor in Virgil's depiction
(^Georg~. III.250-251) of male horses sniffing on the wind the
maddening odor of female horses in heat and shuddering thereat.  In
short, a number of animals have been called (including, in addition to
those already mentioned, piglets, dogs, even birds [in particular, the
hooded falcon]), but none has been chosen.

	|103-108.~  See the note to vv. 95-96.

	|104.~  See Moore (^Contributions to the Textual Criticism of the
"Divina Commedia"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1889]), pp.
483-86), supporting the traditional reading ("da te") against that
strange but, for some people, overpoweringly attractive variant,
"Dante": "There are few passages where we can pronounce with greater
confidence as to the true reading than we can here..." (p. 483).  A
goodly number of Dantists are firmly committed to the notion that the
appearance of the poet's name in the poem, his signature, as it were,
occurs only once, as the first word spoken by Beatrice, in ^Purgatorio~
XXX.55.  Such as they are most grateful to Moore's exertions, since
there had been, before his intervention, more than a few who were most
eager to find "Dante" uttered by Adam, the first namer (see Genesis
2:19-20).

	|107-108.~  Tozer (comm. to vv. 106-108) paraphrases Adam's remark as
follows: "I see those wishes depicted in the mind of God, in which, as
in a faithful mirror, the thoughts of His creatures are reflected;
whereas their minds (and therefore your [i.e., Dante's] mind) cannot
know what is passing in the mind of God, so that you cannot reach the
same certainty."  He continues as follows: "According to this
interpretation, ^pareglio~ is a substantive, meaning a 'parhelion' or
mock-sun; from which sense -- as a parhelion is a reflected or
refracted image of the sun -- it is taken to signify simply a
'reflexion.'  The literal translation, then, of vv. 107-108 will be --
'who makes [H]imself the reflexion of (i.e., in [H]im are reflected)
the other things (and, in particular, men's minds), while none of them
makes itself a reflexion of [H]im ([H]is thoughts are not reflected in
their minds).'"  For an exhaustive (it contains more than 1,500 words)
review of the word ^pareglio~, which, if its general sense is
understood, has caused considerable difficulty, see Scartazzini (comm.
to vv. 106-108).

Adam "repeats" Dante's four questions: (1) How much time has passed
since God put Adam in Eden?  (2) How long did he reside there?  (3)
What caused God's anger against him?  (4) What were the languages that
he was given and that he developed?  (This fourth question has been
variously understood.)

	|110-111.~  Dante's "thought question," intuited by Adam from the mind
of God, included his reverent feelings toward Beatrice (unsurprisingly
enough), who came to him in Eden, the very place that Adam lost,
prepared to lead him on this great spiritual and intellectual journey.

	|114.~  The early commentators did not realize how problematic (and how
important) this verse is.  It presents Adam as having two separate
linguistic "pools," each deriving from a different source, from which
he first gathered and then formed the first human speech.  It was
Lombardi (comm. to this verse), at the early dawn of the "modern age"
in Dante studies, in the last decade of the eighteenth century, who
first made the (fairly obvious) point that the first speaking task
performed by Adam was to name the animals God had just created as
sharers of his world (Genesis 2:19-20).  What was the ^source~ of that
language?  I.e., did Adam learn it or was it innate in him, put there
by God when He formed him from earth?  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 112-114)
is (and correctly so) of the second opinion.  Andreoli (comm. to this
verse) appropriates Tommaseo's words to this effect, but then adds an
important piece of evidence from Dante himself (^De vulgari eloquentia~
[I.vi.4]): "I say that a certain form of language was created by God
^along with the first soul~; I say 'form' with reference both to the
words used for things, and to the construction of words, and to the
arrangement of the construction; and this form of language would have
continued to be used by all speakers, had it not been shattered through
the fault of human presumption, as will be shown below" (tr. S.
Botterill [italics added]).  Thus did Dante at that time account for
the origins of human vocabulary, of grammar, and of syntax; these all
came directly from God and were inherent in Adam (and Eve, we imagine,
though Dante never pays any positive attention to Eve as speaker; that
is not something for which he considers her interesting).  It is Adam
who will name Eve ^virago~ ("woman" -- Gen. 2:23).  What Dante believed
to have been Adam's creative process in developing his God-given
language by adding words to it may be apparent here: From the
pre-Hebrew equivalent of Latin ^vir~, implanted in him by God, he
derived "^vir~ago" (for "wo^man~").

While it is clear that Dante had changed his thinking, by the time he
was writing the ^Commedia~, about the second part of this history of
the language (the length of time that the original Adamic speech
survived - see the note to verse 134), there is no reason to believe he
had altered that first opinion very much, if at all: The first Adamic
speech was given by God, but (and we may be surprised by this, as some
today still are, even to the point of simply getting it wrong) it was
given as perishable.  It was, as we shall shortly see, the core, or
seedbed, of the first vernacular and, like all vernacular speech,
doomed to die out to be replaced by other always changeful "idioms."
God gave his ^Ursprache~  to Adam as a form, containing models for his
development of vocabulary, of grammar, and of syntax.
Simultaneously, He granted him the privilege of naming the animals
himself.  As a result, "dog," "owl," "lion," were terms invented by
Adam, not by God.  The language that he got from God was thus
immediately, even if it first served as a model, in flux, a part of the
mortal world of becoming, as was, we shall shortly learn, the one word
that we can safely assume he got directly from his Creator, His name.
This was "I," but became "El" (again, see the note to verse 134).  (For
the changefulness of God's own name, see Exodus 6:2-3: "I ^[Dominus]~
appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty ^[in Deo
omnipotente]~, but by my name the Lord ^[Adonai]~ I did not make myself
known to them").

For the word ^id,ioma~, which we have here translated "language," but
which seems to be identified by Dante with vernacular speech, see the
note to ^Paradiso~ XV.121-123, the passage in which it has its only
other occurrence in the poem.  On the language of Adam, see P.V.
Mengaldo, "La lingua di Adamo," ^ED~ (IV [1970]), pp. 47b-48b; Ruedi
Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les la,ics~ [Fribourg: Editions
Universitaires, 1996], pp. 197-214).  For the treatment of Adam in ^De
vulgari eloquentia~, see Maria Corti (^Il viaggio testuale~ [Turin:
Einaudi, 1993 {1978}], pp. 243-56).

When we consider the question of the differing linguistic projects
apparent in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ and in the ^Commedia~, it should
become evident that, while seeming to be contradictory, they in fact
respond to different needs.  In the earlier text, Dante's project was
to grammaticize the vernacular; in the ^Comedy~, to vernacularize
the grammatical.  It is a matter of emphasis, since in both cases
there is an urgent desire to valorize the vernacular.  He would not,
as would Milton later, begin by writing Latin verse.  Nor does he
compose verse in Latin until he wrote his two defensive ^Eclogues~
(in which he might appear to be saying, "I am perfectly capable of
writing classical Latin verse whenever I choose to").  Nonetheless,
if Italian was to be the vehicle for his poems, he was never without
awareness that such a decision needed to be defended before the eyes of
those in his audience, lay and clerical, who had "intellectual" (one
might say philosophical - see, again, Imbach) interests that required
the capacity to handle the language of dead Romans and living clergy.
And so in ^De vulgari~ his effort is bent (as it was in ^Vita Nuova~
XXV and especially in ^Convivio~ I) on showing that the vernacular is
absolutely capable of expressing everything that Latin can express.
Having done so, feeling more confident in not being forced to defend the
use of the vernacular in "serious" literature, as earlier he had felt he
had to, he now can delight in showing the superiority of the vernacular
in gestures of linguistic exuberance that he would never have earlier
dared put forth (e.g., the words ^culo~ and ^mamma~, to name but two).
See, for a more detailed argument by this writer, Hollander (^Dante:
A Life in Works~ [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001]), pp. 54-74.
And see Gary Cestaro (^Dante and the Grammar of the Nursing Body~ [Notre
Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2003]) for a quite different view
of the subject, if one that has certain common interests.

Tozer summarizes the rest of the canto (comm. to these verses): "Of
Dante's four questions, which have just been stated, Adam answers first
No. 3 -- 'What was the real cause of the Fall of Man?' (vv. 115-117);
next No. 1 -- 'How long a time had elapsed from the Creation to the
present moment?' (vv. 118-123); then No. 4 -- 'What language did Adam
speak?' (vv. 124-138); and finally No. 2 -- 'How long a time did he
spend in the Earthly Paradise?' (vv. 139-142)."

	|115-117.~  Adam answers first the third question that Dante has put to
him, a question which, as many commentators point out, reflects the
gravest issue that Adam knows: his own disobedience that cost him and
all our race Eden.  This is "paradisal" behavior that we witness here;
what sinner in ^Inferno~ would voluntarily recite his worst sin first
(or at all)?  There are a few exceptions, beginning with Ciacco (see
^Inf~. VI.53), but most, as we saw, try to avoid this subject.

Hardly anyone dealing with this tercet recently (and this is
particularly true with respect to American Dantists, who are perhaps
more drawn to Ulysses than may seem reasonable) fails to discuss the
obvious "quotation" in the phrase "il trapassar del segno" (the
trespass of the boundary line) of ^Inferno~ XXVI.107-109: "... we
reached the narrow strait / where Hercules marked off ^[segn@o]~ the
limits, / warning all men to go no farther."  Surprisingly, the only
apparent mention in the commentaries collected in the DDP (but see,
e.g., Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi [^Paradiso, con il commento di A.
M. C. L.~ {Milan: Mondadori, 1997}, p. 728]) is in Bosco/Reggio (comm.
to vv. 109-117), referring to this passage's relationship with the
theme of transgression, as embodied in the canto of Ulysses.  However,
cf. (among others) Amilcare Iannucci ("Ulysses' ^folle volo~: the
Burden of History," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 3 [1976]: 426); Peter Hawkins
("Trespassing on the Word: God's Book and Ours," ^Journal of the
American Academy of Religion~ 47 [1979]: 47-53); Kevin Brownlee
("^Paradiso~ XXVI," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings
III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis {virginiana}~,
16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1995
{1990}], p. 394); and Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy":
Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992],
pp. 49, 52, 58, 106, 108, 112, and 238), whose treatment begins with
reference to Nardi's consideration ("La tragedia di Ulisse," in his
^Dante e la cultura medievale~ [Bari: Laterza, 1942], pp. 89-99) of
both Ulysses and Adam as having trespassed boundaries.  See also
Giancarlo Rati ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Paradiso,"~ ed. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 2000 {1988}], pp.
513-14).

For a less than convincing emendation of ^Inferno~ XXVI.100,
substituting ^arto~ (narrow) for ^alto~ (deep), see Guglielmo Gorni ("I
^riguardi~ di Ercole e l'^arto passo~ di Ulisse," ^Letteratura italiana
antica~ 1 [2000]: 43-58).

	|116.~  The last occurrence of the noun ^cagione~ (reason, cause), of
its 46 instances in the poem, is found here (and for the penultimate,
see verse 113).  As the poem concludes, discursive reasoning yields to
more intuitive forms of understanding and expression.

The use of the noun ^essilio~ (exile) binds two other figures to Adam
in having shared this bitter experience, Dante and Virgil (who sees his
afterlife as exilic - see ^Purg~. XXI.18).  It is not surprising to
find "Virgilio" as its rhyme in verse 118.

	|118-120.~  For the first notice of Adam's long life of exile from
God's kingdom, first on earth and then in Limbo, see ^Purgatorio~
XXXIII.58-63 and the note thereto.  See also the note to ^Paradiso~
IX.40 and to vv. 121-123, below.

Eusebius (whose dates were the basis for Jerome's authoritative
^Chronicon~ [which served most medieval encyclopedists, such as Isidore
of Seville and Uguccione da Pisa]) is credited by the more recent
commentators (beginning with Lombardi [comm. to vv. 119-120]) as being
Dante's source for the 4,302 years between Adam's death and the
Harrowing.

	|118.~  This represents the thirty-second and final appearance of
Virgil's name in the poem.  It thus occurs slightly more than half as
often as that of Beatrice, which appears sixty-three times.  (See the
notes to ^Purg~. XV.77 and ^Par~. XVII.19.)

	|121-123.~  Adam says that he had lived on earth for 930 solar years
(see Genesis 5:5).  This means that he was harrowed (in A.D. 34) after
5,232 years (930 \+ 4,302) of sinful life, first on earth, then in
Limbo, where his punishment was, apparently, to live without hope yet
in desire.  At least that is Virgil's description of the suffering of
him and his co-sufferers in Limbo (^Inf~. IV.42: "without hope we live
in longing"), and it certainly fits him and all other damned pagans.
But what of the Hebrew saints, like Adam?  During their time in Hell
were they equally without hope?  Or, because they believed in Christ to
come, were they in fact hopeful?  Adam, however, does refer to his time
in Hell as being typified by "anguish" (verse 133).  In short, this is
not an issue that Dante has chosen to confront and we cannot say
whether Dante thought that Adam and his eventually to-be-harrowed
companions knew that Christ was coming for them or not, or whether they
even hoped that He would.

Adam has now enjoyed 1,266 years of grace in Heaven.  Adam's years
coincide, of course, with the course of human life in general, 6,498
years along its road in 1300.  See the note to ^Paradiso~ IX.40 for one
traditional estimate of the future duration of human time.  And see,
for a fuller discussion of three views of that future, involving the
Platonic Great Year (36,000 years), a medieval variant of that
tradition (13,000 years), and St. Augustine's (possible) view that the
world will last seven millennia, the last paragraph of the note to
^Inferno~ I.1 and the note to ^Paradiso~ IX.40.

	|124-126.~  Pietro di Dante explicitly identifies (comm. to vv.
124-132) Adam's first ^lingua~ as being vernacular speech.  It was
extinct, this tercet insists, before construction of the Tower of Babel
began.	Many have realized that this is a direct contradiction of what
Dante had said in ^De vulgari~ (I.vi.4-7), where he specifically says
that the first language was Hebrew and that it was spoken until after the
construction of the Tower and until the Advent of Christ. (For a study
of the literary history of this topos, see Arno Borst, ^Der Turmbau von
Babel~, 3 vols.  [Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 1957-60].)

From Genesis, Dante might have learned several things about the history
of the language that squared with his spectacularly idiosyncratic
theory of that history.  The tenth chapter teaches that Noah's three
sons (Japheth, Ham, and Shem) each had children, and all these groups
of progeny spoke different languages ^(linguae)~; that is, the
"confusion" was apparently in progress ^before~ the launch of Nimrod's
"unachievable" architectural project.  Nonetheless, Genesis 11 begins with
the earth still being of a single tongue ^(terra labii unius)~, and
this passage is what Dante "revises," whatever justification he might
have thought he had found, in the previous chapter, for doing so.  God
puts humankind into confusion for trying to build the tower (and that
is the version found both in Genesis and in ^De vulgari~); in the
^Commedia~, however, the result of Babel is pre-Babelic.  This is not
the only time that we find Dante revising the text of the Bible to suit
his own purpose.  To seize on only one other blatant example, found in
a neighboring passage in ^De vulgari~ (I.iv.2-3), Dante denies the
authority of Genesis in making Eve the first speaker (God, he says,
would not have wanted a woman to utter the first spoken word).  And see
his similarly high-handed treatment of classical text, e.g., of the
^Aeneid~ in ^Purgatorio~ XXII.40-41.  Fortunately, there is a good deal
of playfulness that lies behind these otherwise numbingly troglodytic
gestures; nonetheless, there they are, and they are certainly
challenging.

	|130.~  See P.V. Mengaldo, "lingua," ^ED~ (III [1971]), p. 661b,
discussing the source of this verse in Egidio Romano, ^De regimine
principum~ (III.ii.24): "It is a natural thing that man should speak,
and nature teaches him to do so; but whether the speech should be
German or French or Tuscan nature does not instruct him.  On the
contrary, a man must himself learn it, either by himself or with the
aid of others."

	|132.~  Daniello (comm. to vv. 130-132) makes the astute observation
that Dante is here citing the first line of the poem in Proven$cal he
composes and attributes to Arnaut Daniel (it actually derives from a
poem by Folchetto -- see the note to ^Purg~. XXVI.140-147 -- "Tan
m'abellis l'amoros pensamen").  See ^Purgatorio~ XXVI.140.

	|133.~  Adam dates the change in the pre-Hebrew vernacular as having
occurred before his death at the age of 930.  His words do not allow
any greater precision than that.

It is striking that we do not hear his name in this scene (we have
heard it five times in ^Inferno~ and ^Purgatorio~).  See Andrea Ciotti,
"Adamo," ^ED~ (I [1970]), pointing out that medieval Scriptural
exegesis related Greek ^'#adh#am~ to ^#ad#ahmah~ ("man" to "earth"),
thus ^homo~ to ^humus~.  This would surely have been of interest to
Dante, since it would tend to locate Adamic vernacular within the low
style, Dante's own (or so at least he chose to present it as being).

	|134.~	This verse has been the cause of a great deal of
confusion, as some of its interpreters are honest enough to admit.
Scartazzini, after an exhaustive survey of the history of its
interpretation, concludes with the notice that, while it is most
embarrassing for a commentator to admit such a thing, he has not
resolved its problems.	(For another noteworthy attempt to clarify [if
not to solve] the problem, see Porena [comm. to this verse].)  The most
enduring, among the several desperate stabs it has caused, has been the
following: Vellutello (comm. to vv. 130-138) was apparently the first
to claim that "I" was to be read numerically, as "one."  Another notion
has periodically reappeared (after having been introduced by Scartazzini
[comm. to this verse]): "I" (or "J") is the first letter of "Jah" or
"Jehovah."  A much rarer but still interesting proposed solution is
only found as late as Trucchi's commentary (comm. to vv. 133-138):
Dante wanted "I" and not "El" because "I" (or "J," the same character
in his Italian) was the first letter of "Jesus."  Nonetheless, the
formulation that "I" equals "un" ("one") found favor, over the years,
with many interpreters (including several editors, who replace what is
"I" in our text with "un"), beginning with Francesco da Buti (comm. to
vv. 133-142).  Lombardi (comm. to this verse) was apparently the first
commentator to refer to Dante's earlier treatment of the nature of Adam's
first word in ^De vulgari~; he also pointed out that Dante was (whether
deliberately or not he does not say) in disagreement with Isidore,
who had been plain that "El" was the name that God was first called.
That "I" as the number/name of God is a valid reading of this verse is
reinforced by the presence of the same alpha-numerical pun on the Roman
"i" as "one" at ^Paradiso~ XIX.128.

See Gino Casagrande ("'I s'appellava in terra il sommo bene'
[^Paradiso~, XXVI, 134]," ^Aevum~ 50 [1976]: 249-73) for a careful
consideration of the problems of this verse.  He ends up linking it,
through the commentary of the Ottimo ^ad loc~., to Isidore's eighth (of
ten appellations) name of God (^Etym~. VII.i), ^ia~, itself connected
to the Hebrew word ^alleluia~, as praise of God's name.  Hollander
(^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1969], p. 144n.) had previously argued for Isidore's ^ninth~
name of God, the ^tetragrammaton~, transliterated as ^ia ia~, as being
the text that Dante had in mind, as evidenced by the parodic reference
to it and the sixth name of God ("Ego ^sum~, qui ^sum~" [I am that I
am]) found first in the Siren's self-naming (^Purg~. XIX.19), "^Io
son~, ^io son~ dolce serena" and then corrected in Beatrice's
self-naming (^Purg~. XXX.73), "^Ben son~, ^ben son~ Beatrice."  (All of
these phrases have repetition as a common feature.)  For the view that
it is in Isidore's use of Jerome's writings in his formulation of the
^tetragrammaton~ as referring to God's ineffability that Dante finds
the reason to reject ^El~ (the first name for God according to Dante in
^De vulgari eloquentia~ [^Dve~ I.iv.4]) for ^I~, see Phillip Damon
("Adam on the Primal Language," ^Italica~ 38 [1961]: 60-62).  (Gino
Casagrande [^ibid~., pp. 266-71] reports that the eighth name, ^ia~,
indicates, according to Isidore, God's invisibility, not His ineffable
nature.)  For the whole question, see Porena's endnote to this canto
(in his comm. to verse 134).

Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~
[Ravenna: Longo, 1980], p. 128), returning to this subject, offers a
hypothetical reason for Dante's change of mind: The poet wanted to
associate his own vernacular Italian, in which the name of God
coincides with Adamic pre-Hebrew vernacular, with that first of all
vernaculars.  And he might have cited (but in fact did not) the
following passage in ^De vulgari~ (I.vi.2): "For whoever is so
misguided as to think that the place of his birth is the most
delightful spot under the sun may also believe that his own language --
his mother tongue, that is -- is pre-eminent among all others; and, as
a result, he may believe that his language was also Adam's" (tr. S.
Botterill).  This mocking of boosters of their own inconsequential
towns perhaps also conveys Dante's own hidden claim in the ^Commedia~:
Dante's version of Tuscan is to be seen as in some way resurrecting
Adamic vernacular, coinciding in the vowel "I," which is the name of
God in each.  For a similar opinion, see Christian Moevs (^The
Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2005], p. 183).  And see ^Paradiso~ XXIX.17 for the dative pronoun "i"
referring to God.

One might also speculate that Dante considered ^El~ as the name of God
associated with Hebrew "grammaticality," the written language of the
scribes of the Bible; for this reason he must retract his earlier
opinion ^(El)~ in favor of a truly "vernacular" solution ^(I)~.
Further, we may reflect that when he considered the context of his
remark in ^De vulgari~ (I.iv.4), he surely would have noted that there
he had characterized Adam's first word as an emotive exclamation,
indeed a cry of joy.  The word ^I~, which we have just heard Adam use
in the preceding verse ("pria ch'^i~' scendessi"), may sound and feel
"vernacular," while ^El~ may sound and feel "grammatical," that is,
like a language learned in school.  Adam tells Dante that first God's
name was "I," and only later was He called "El."  The text indicates
that his happened sometime after Adam died (i.e., after his span of 930
years), about 1000 years, long enough for the Hebrews to have invented
grammar and had their language taught in schools.  John of Serravalle
(comm. to vv. 133-138) says that Heber, of the fourth generation from
Noah, was the first to speak Hebrew and call God "El" in it.

	|135.~  God the Father had been stern with sinful Adam for more than
five thousand years; then his Son drew him forth from the Limbus up to
the Empyrean.  We hear nothing of the possibility of purgation for
pre-Christian Christians and so must assume that in His triumph (^Par~.
XXIII.20), when he harrowed Hell, He brought them straight "home."
Anything less charitable (i.e., a visit to Purgatory) would seem picky,
wouldn't it?  And so here is a paradox: some saved Christians, even
most (and it seems likely that this restriction applies to all but the
saintliest of saints), bound for Heaven must pass through purgation,
while the virtuous Hebrews who were harrowed by Christ (if not all the
saved pagans - we do see Cato and Statius on the mount of Purgatory)
apparently do not have to repay any of their sins on earth.  Merely a
moment's reflection puts David and Solomon in the dock of our
understandable sense of retributive justice.

	|136.~  For ^El~ as a name of God, see the note to verse 134.  And see
Moore (^Contributions to the Textual Criticism of the "Divina
Commedia"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1889], pp. 487-92)
for the history of this tormented verse in the manuscripts.

	|137-138.~  The recognition of the Horatian source (^Ars poetica~
60-63) of these verses begins with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv.
124-129).  Here is Horace, as cited, with a translation, by Singleton
(comm. to these verses):

  ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos,
  prima cadunt; ita verborum vetus interit aetas,
  et iuvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque.
  debemur morti nos nostraque....
  As forests change their leaves with each year's decline,
  and the earliest drop off: so with words, the old race dies,
  and, like the young of human kind, the new-born bloom and thrive.
  We are doomed to death -- we and all things ours.

Imbach (^Dante, la philosophie et les la,ics~ [Fribourg: Editions
Universitaires, 1996], p. 212) notes that Dante has cited Horace, ^Ars
poetica~ 70-71 in ^Convivio~ (II.xiii.10 - for earlier notice of this
fact, beginning with Steiner [comm. to vv. 136-138], see the DDP.)

	|139-142.~  The question of the length of time spent by Adam in Eden
before the Fall is not uniformly dealt with.  On the other hand, and as
Thomas Hill ("Adam's Noon: ^Paradiso~ XXVI, 139-142," ^Dante Studies~
100 [1982]: 94) has demonstrated, Dante is not alone in stating that
the first man's innocence lasted only between six and seven hours,
citing Petrus Comestor and Gulielmus Durandus as preceding him in this
opinion.

Dante obviously felt that the detail was of great enough interest to
make it the climactic, canto-ending detail.

Kevin Brownlee ("^Paradiso~ XXVI," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Introductory Readings III: "Paradiso,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura
Dantis {virginiana}~, 16-17, supplement, Charlottesville: University of
Virginia, 1995 {1990}], p. 396) points out that this period corresponds
more or less exactly to the amount of time Dante himself has recently
spent in the garden of Eden (see ^Purg~. XXVII.133 and XXXIII.103-105).
He might have added that Dante also spends six hours with Adam and
his companions here in the Starry Sphere (starting at ^Par~. XXII.129).
See the note to ^Paradiso~ XXVII.79-81.
And see the similar observation offered by P. Sabbatino, ^L'Eden della
nuova poesia: Saggi sulla "Divina Commedia"~ (Florence: Olschki, 1991),
p. 99, pointing out that Dante enters the earthly paradise on the sixth
day of his otherworldly journey at the sixth hour of the day, while Adam,
on the sixth day of Creation, fell at the sixth hour and while Christ was
crucified to redeem fallen mankind at the sixth hour as well.  Sabbatino's
observation of these numerical similarities is cited by Filippo Bognini,
"Gli occhi di Ooliba: Una proposta per ^Purg~. XXXII 148-60 e XXXIII
44-45," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 7 (2007): 82 (n. 32).
