	|1-18.~  For the Ovidian resonances in this passage, so marked by
classical motif (the poem as voyage across a sea, the poet as inspired
by gods and/or muses) and allusion (Jason and the voyage of the
Argonauts), see Picone ("Dante argonauta: la ricezione dei miti
ovidiani nella ^Commedia~," in M. Picone and B. Zimmermann, eds.,
^Ovidius redivivus: von Ovid zu Dante~ [Stuttgart: M&P Verlag, 1994],
pp. 191-200).  The baptismal and related gnoseological resonances of
the network of images in the opening of this canto are closely studied
by Giorgio Stabile ("Il Canto II del ^Paradiso~," in ^"Paradiso":
Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1989], pp.
35-42, 55-77).

	|1-6.~  The canto begins apparently by discouraging the "average
reader" from attempting to understand it.  As we shall shortly
discover, only some of us are welcomed to the attempt (vv. 10-18).  We
may be put in mind of the similar gesture near the beginning of
^Convivio~ (I.i.2-6).  That passage continues (I.i.7): "Blessed are the
few who sit at the table where the bread of the angels is eaten, and
most unfortunate those who share the food of sheep" (tr. R. Lansing).
See William J. O'Brien ("'The Bread of Angels' in ^Paradiso~ II: A
Liturgical Note," ^Dante Studies~ 97 [1979]: 97-106) for a strong
differentiation of the references to the "bread of angels" in these two
passages, the first accommodating secular knowing, this one based on
faith and the Scriptures.  For the differing audiences sought for
^Convivio~ and ^Paradiso~, see Vincenzo Placella ("Il pubblico del
^Convivio~ e quello del ^Paradiso~," in ^Miscellanea di studi in onore
di Raffaele Sirri~, a cura di M. Palumbo and V. Placella [Naples:
Federico e Ardia, 1995], pp. 365-73).  With regard to Dante's program
for popularizing Aristotle as established in ^Convivio~, see Sonia
Gentili ("Il fondamento aristotelico del programma divulgativo dantesco
[^Conv~. I]," in ^Le culture di Dante.  Atti del quarto Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone ^et al.~ [Florence:
Cesati, 2004], pp. 179-97).

	|1.~  Despite the distraction of an address to the reader, we realize
that, beginning with the opening of this canto, we are in the sphere of
the Moon.  There is only one other occasion in the ten heavens when the
entrance to a celestial realm coincides with the beginning of a canto:
^Paradiso~ XXI (Saturn).  Those who are overwhelmed by the organized
quality of Dante's mind might like to be aware of its "disorderly" side
as well.

The "little bark" inevitably reminds readers of the "small bark"
(^navicella~ -- ^Purg~. I.2) that represents Dante's intellect at the
beginning of ^Purgatorio~.  His capacities, we may infer, have
increased in accord with his nearness to God; his ship, we understand
by implication, is now a mighty craft; ours is the "little bark."

	|2.~ For only the second time in the poem (see ^Inf~. XXII.118), Dante
addresses his readers as listeners, as Aversano (^Dante daccapo~
[glosses to the ^Paradiso~], ^copia d'eccezione~, sent by the author on
11 September 2001, p. 10), points out.  Since these potential customers
are urged ^not~ to read the poem, Aversano goes on to speculate, they
are not referred to as readers (in the previous passage the reader was
both ^lettore~ and auditor).

	|3.~  The phrase "ship that singing makes its way" once again
capitalizes on the equation ship = poem (see ^Purg~. I.2).  The word
^legno~ as metaphoric expression, the material of construction being
referred to as the thing itself, has a classical heritage and a heavy
Dantean presence.  While in ^Purgatorio~ it appears four times without
once having this meaning, in ^Inferno~ it had appeared ten times, in
fully seven of which it denotes "ship" or "boat."  Now in the last
^cantica~ it is used six times, twice (here and in Canto XIII.136) with
the meaning "ship."

The self-consciously "literary" language continues that strain from the
first thirty-six verses of the opening canto in less lengthy but
similar behavior in the first eighteen of this one.  And see Paola
Allegretti ("Argo: 'Dietro al mio legno che cantando varca' [^Par~. II
3]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 69 [2004]: 185-209) for a consideration of the
opening passage of this canto (II.1-15) as the centerpiece between two
other important passages involving ships, ^Purgatorio~ II.10-51 and
^Paradiso~ XXXIII.94-96, with ample consideration of classical sources,
in a revisitation of Curtius's often-cited essay, "The Ship of the
Argonauts" (in his ^Essays on European Literature~, tr. M. Kowal
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 {1950}], pp. 465-96).

	|4-6.~  The warning sounds "elitist," even scornful (and see the note
to vv. 13-15).  But if we think about what is at stake, nothing less
than our salvation, its exclusionary nature seems only necessary.  Did
Dante really mean that those of us who have no Christian upbringing
either cannot be saved or at least cannot be saved by reading Dante's
poem?  The latter is what the passage apparently asserts, for if we
lose track of him, we may lose track of God.  It is perhaps necessary
to remind ourselves that the voice we hear belongs to an unsuccessful,
exiled Florentine, with one completed work longer than a single
^canzone~ (^Vita nuova~, some twenty years behind him), who has banked
all that he is and has on this text that he will barely manage to
finish before his death.  The intervening centuries have allowed Dante
an authority only doubtfully accorded him by his early commentators,
who by and large manage to avoid paying sufficient attention to this
amazing claim, with possibly the single exception of Benvenuto (comm.
to vv. 5-6), perhaps the sole interpreter to put the potential failure
of Dante's readership in specifically Christian terms: "quia cum vestro
parvo ingenio non possetis intelligere meam profundam materiam, et
possetis ^errare a via rectae fidei~" (lest, with your limited
understanding, you fail to understand the depth of my material, and
^wander from the path of the true faith~ [italics added]).  Benvenuto
goes on to cite Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, not the
^Consolation of Philosophy~, but the specifically Christian treatise,
^The Trinity Is One God, Not Three Gods~.

For the interesting and convincing view that Dante's sending his unready
enthusiasts home safely is meant to reflect correctively on Ulysses'
encouragement of his wearied men to take an even more dangerous voyage in
his company (^Inf~. XXVI.121-123), see Margherita Frankel, "The Context
of Dante's Ulysses: the Similes in ^Inferno~ XXVI," ^Dante Studies~ 104
(1986): 106-7.

	|7-9.~  For a discussion of the triune God, see Canto I, note 13.  And
for the "triune Apollo," see Giuseppe Di Scipio (^The Presence of
Pauline Thought in the Works of Dante~ [Lewiston, N.Y.: The Edwin
Mellen Press, 1995)], pp. 258-59), who offers a passage in Alain de
Lille's ^Anticlaudianus~ as a potential source for Dante's
Christianized Apollo.  For the presence of a text of Alanus in another
context, the river of light in ^Paradiso~ XXX, see the note to ^Par~.
XXX.61-69.

	|7.~  Familiar by now (e.g., ^Inf~. I.22-24, ^Purg~. I.1-3) is a watery
expression for non-aqueous spaces.  The assertion that the poet is the
first to report his travel over such "seas" is essentially true; for an
exhaustive discussion of the topos of novelty in the ^Commedia~, see
Giuseppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002)], pp.
57-86).

	|9.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 7-9) thinks that Dante's "nove," not only
indicating the number "nine," is more subtly construed as a form of the
adjective ^nuovo~ (new) and believes that the poet felt the need for
new muses since he was writing of the Christian God, not the pagan
divinities.  While that argument probably needs to be more
accommodating (since the phrase "nine Muses" is bypassed only with
considerable difficulty), it should have alerted readers to the
unlikely presence of pagan goddesses at this point in the poem's
development.  Suffice it to say that such concerns were expressed from
time to time in the commentary tradition, but have never won the day,
so that there results a certain unsureness of exactly how to deal with
this verse.  Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) has a useful review of
such puzzlement, but does not attempt to solve the riddle himself.
However, possibly the most compelling gloss to this verse was written
by Giovan Battista Gelli halfway into the sixteenth century, and not in
response to this verse, but to ^Inferno~ II.7-9: "Ma perch@e io mi
persuado che il Poeta nostro, per trattar di quelle cose divine, le
quali son veramente divine, e non fabulose come quelle delle quali
trattano quasi tutti gli altri poeti, abbia in tutte le cose ancor
concetti molto pi@u alti e pi@u profondi di loro, dico ancora io
(ascendendo con lo intelletto pi@u alto, ...) che le Muse, propiamente
e divinamente parlando, significano quelle intelligenze, o sieno anime
o sieno motori, che muovono e guidano le nove sfere celesti, cio@e
quelle de' sette pianeti, quella del cielo stellato e quella del primo
mobile" (However, since I am persuaded that our poet, in order to treat
of things divine -- indeed truly divine, not the stuff of fable, such
as almost all other poets deal with, had in all things ideas both more
lofty and more profound than they do; and I say further, ascending
higher with my intellect, that the Muses, properly and divinely
speaking, signify those intelligences, whether they be souls or movers,
that move and direct the nine heavenly spheres, that is those of the
seven planets, that of the Starry Sphere, and that of the Primum
Mobile).  See Dante's own earlier references to these ^movitori~ in
^Convivio~ (II.iv.13, II.vi.1, II.xiii.5).  See Hollander ("Dante and
his Commentators," in ^The Cambridge Companion to Dante~, ed. R. Jacoff
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993], p. 227), for a highly
similar solution without, however, reference to Gelli.  If the verse is
read in this way, the discomfort of Benvenuto is addressed without
twisting the literal sense of the line.  It is the nine heavens that
are referred to as "muses"; they are the sign of God's creating power
and lead Dante's mind to port.  (Several commentators, beginning with
Vellutello, refer to the Muses in this context as Dante's ^bussola~
[compass], but only one [Campi, comm. to vv. 7-9] sees that metaphor
within a Christian conceptual frame, i.e., that these are not the
classical Muses.)

	|10-12.~  The handful of Christian readers who will be able to navigate
the third canticle are marked by long devotion to the study of
religious truth (not necessarily demonstrating, as several commentators
urge, a more general philosophical interest).  For the distinction, see
Attilio Mellone, "Pane degli angeli," ^ED~ (IV [1973]), p. 266,
contrasting what is conveyed by the expression "bread of angels" when
it is used in ^Convivio~ (I.i.7) to its meaning here; there it covers
all kinds of knowing, but here only revealed truth.

The opening tercet looks to the Bible and to Dante's ^Convivio~, as
Singleton points out (comms. ^Par~. I.1-6 and I.10-11).  While the
biblical phrase (Psalms 77 [78]:25, Wisdom 16:20) is clearly
theological in meaning, the passage from ^Convivio~ (I.i.7) is not:
"Blessed are the few who sit at the table where the bread of the angels
is eaten, and most unfortunate those who share the food of sheep!"  It
seems likely that the author of the ^Comedy~ would look back upon these
words with a shudder, noting this hostility to the most Christian of
images, the faithful as a flock to which Jesus is shepherd.

	|10.~  "Voi altri pochi" (you other few): This is the fifteenth address
to the reader in the poem.  See the note to ^Inferno~ VIII.94-96; and
see Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002], pp.
117-58), for a full discussion of Dante's addresses to the reader
(nineteen in all, according to him [pp. 119-21]), as part of the poet's
larger authorial strategies.

	|11.~ For the meaning of the Eucharist in the liturgy for the Wednesday
after Easter as informing this scene (which just happens to take place
on the Wednesday after Easter, the day that Beatrice ascends with the
protagonist), see William O'Brien ("'The Bread of Angels' in ^Paradiso~
II: A Liturgical Note," ^Dante Studies~ 97 [1979], pp. 99-100).  The
offertory verse from the mass for that day, O'Brien reports, quoting
the Roman Missal, contains the phrase "the bread of angels" in the
following exalted context: "The Lord God opened the gates of Heaven and
rained down manna upon them (the disciples in company of the risen
Jesus) so that they might eat; He gave them heavenly bread; and,
hallelujah, man ate the bread of angels (^panem Angelorum manducavit
homo~)."

	|12.~  Christians on earth will never be able to attain angelic
understanding of the doctrine that nourishes them; for that they must
await their afterlife in Paradise.

	|13-15.~  We are warned that even a Christian reader, losing track of
the ship that is ^Paradiso~, may get lost in these precincts.  The
daring of these lines, far beyond approaching what in Yiddish is
referred to as ^chutzpah~, is perhaps not imaginable in any other poet.

	|16.~  The "famous men" are the Argonauts who accompanied Jason on the
first voyage made on a ship, in the thirteenth century B.C., to
Colchis, a voyage already referred to (^Inf~. XVIII.86-87) and which
will furnish the matter for the ultimate "historical" reference in the
poem (^Par~. XXXIII.95-96), a final look at the voyage of the ^Argo.~
Dante refers to Colchis by the singular form of the adjectival noun of
place, "colco."

	|17-18.~  In order to gain the Golden Fleece, Jason, aided by Medea's
herbal concoctions, performs wondrous deeds in Colchis (^Metam~.
VII.100-158).  In Ovid, however, it is not Jason's shipmates who stand
amazed at what they witness of Jason's astounding feats (e.g., plowing
a field by means of the iron-tipped horns of two bulls, turned upside
down and serving as Jason's plow, and seeding it with serpents' teeth,
with a resulting harvest of soldiers), but the onlooking Colchians
("mirantur Colchi" [^Metam~. VII.120]).  Dante is here not nodding, but
"rewriting" the classical text in order to make it more worthy of
bearing a Christian message, as Picone is aware ("Canto II," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2002], p. 47).

Picone, pp. 42-47, expands on the importance of the Ovidian motif of
the voyage beyond normal human experience exemplified in Jason and the
voyage of the Argonauts (^Metam~. VII.100-120); unlike most who have
worked with this material and who deal with only its final reflection
in the ^Commedia~ (^Par~. XXXIII.94-96), the voyage of the Argo, Picone
does include the central passage (^Par~. XXV.1-9) in which, if the
reference is more delicate, the relationship between these two
"sailors" has its strongest moment.  But see the similar treatment in
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969], pp. 220-232).

	|19-22.~  The narrative continues with Dante and Beatrice being drawn
heavenward by their desire for God, she with her eyes fixed on Heaven,
he with his fixed on hers, which serve as his mirrors.  This is the
first of the formulaic ascents that will precede the arrival and
description of each new heaven.  For a listing of them all, see the
"map" of Paradise in the introductory lecture to this ^cantica~.

	|21.~  While some complicate the meaning of the comparison, it is
perhaps better to see it in simple terms: The poet, who knows that the
stars are actually moving rather rapidly in their orbits, compares
their movement to the rapid upward movement of Beatrice and himself.

	|23-26.~  One of the most frequently discussed examples of Dante's
employment of the device ^hysteron proteron~, a rhetorical figure that,
to denote speed and the resultant difficulty of knowing which event in
a sequence preceded which other(s), reverses the normal order.  As a
speeding arrow (actually a bolt shot from a crossbow) is suddenly
released from the catch (or "nut "or "peg" [Tozer, comm. to ^Par~.
II.23-24]) on the bow, flies, and strikes its target, that is how
quickly Dante finds himself within the surface of the Moon, so quickly
indeed that the constituent moments of the ascent seem to have been
experienced in reverse order.  Gabriele (comm. ^Par~. II.23-24) informs
us that this iron "arrow" (the bolt) was usually four-sided.

	|30.~  Beatrice makes plain what we have probably fathomed: Dante is in
the sphere of the Moon, within the body of this "star" itself.  Dante's
terms for the heavenly bodies are, from a modern point of view, both
inconsistent and, at times, different from ours, as the reader has
already probably noted.  (Later on in this canto he will refer to the
Moon as a planet [^pianeto~, verse 76] and not, as here, a "star."  He
uses the terms interchangeably; for us the Moon is neither of the
above.)

	|31-36.~  Dante's first impression of the physicality of the Moon tells
us that its matter is less "material" than earth's: For all its
rock-like qualities, it seems a cloud.  As Singleton (comm. to verse
31) points out, Aristotle taught in ^De caelo~ that the Moon and all
above is physically different from our material world.  It is thus that
Dante must describe it as "eternal," since, unlike earth, it is
imperishable.  That Beatrice, pure form, penetrates the matter of the
Moon is not surprising; that Dante also does so raises the question in
his mind that we find referred to in vv. 37-39.

	|32.~  The poet is of the opinion that the Moon shines with its own
light as well as reflects the light of the Sun (^Mon~. III.iv.17-18),
as Singleton observes (comm. ^Par~.II.32).  In this canto Dante refers
only to the second phenomenon (vv. 79-81).

	|34.~  For the possible resonance of a biblical text (Matthew 13.44-46)
in Dante's "pearl," see the note to ^Paradiso~ VI.127.

	|37-45.~  The poet raises the question once more (see ^Par~. I.4-6,
^Par~. I.73, ^Par~. I.98-99) of his presence in the heavens with his
flesh in such a way as to make us feel that he wants us to believe he
was there in body (otherwise the "bonus" referred to in the tercet that
concludes this passage will not apply).

Singleton (comm. ^Par~. I.98-99) refers to St. Thomas's words that were
clearly meant to calm fearful Christians, worried that at the general
resurrection saved souls would be kept from approaching Heaven by the
substance of the spheres.  Here is Thomas's answer (^Summa contra
Gentiles~ IV.87): "Neither does this divine promise meet an
impossibility in the assertion that celestial bodies are unbreakable so
that the glorious bodies may not be elevated above them.  For the
divine power will bring it about that the glorious bodies can be
simultaneously where the other bodies are; an indication of this was
given in the body of Christ when He came to the disciples, 'the doors
being shut' (John 20:26)."

See Picone ("Il corpo della/nella luna: sul canto II del ^Paradiso~,"
^L'Alighieri~ 15 [2000], pp. 7-12), for discussion of Dante's bodily
assumption; and again ("Canto II," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Paradiso~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2002], pp. 35-39), hammering home his essential observation,
that Dante wants us to acknowledge his presence in paradise in the
flesh, without, perhaps, paying sufficient attention to the deliberate
coyness of his claim, only made indirectly (if clearly enough) some
three-quarters of the way into the ^cantica~ (see the note to ^Par~.
I.73).

	|39.~  The double presence of the word ^corpo~ in a single verse is a
sign of the poet's concern with materiality here; ^corpo~ (body)
appears nine times in this canto, far more often than in any other
(nearly one-sixth of its 55 appearances throughout the poem; ^Inferno~
XXXIII is the closest challenger, with five).

	|46-51.~  Having done what Beatrice exhorted him to do (^Par~.
II.29-30), thank God for raising him from the earth to the Moon, Dante
now asks the question the resolution of which will occupy the rest of
the canto -- the cause of the dark spots on the Moon.

	|48.~  The word "rimoto" picks up the same word in verse 66 of the
preceding canto (^Par~. I.66).

	|51.~  For the legend that Cain was confined to the Moon and bore a
bundle of thorns, see the note to ^Inf~. XX.124-126.  For a study of
the question of these "lunar spots," see at least Bruno Nardi ("Il
canto delle macchie lunari [II ^Par~.]," ^L'Alighieri~ 26 [1985]:
21-32) and Giorgio Stabile ("Il Canto II del ^Paradiso~," in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989], pp. 47-55); according to the latter, p. 48, Dante puts
forward "tre interpretazioni: del mago, del filosofo naturale e del
teologo" (three interpretations, that of the ^magus~, that of the
"scientist," and that of the theologian) only to destroy the first two
in favor of the last.

	|52-57.~  Beatrice gently chides those rationalists (including Dante)
who analyze ineffectively, since they lack the principle that informs
the phenomena that they observe, evidence found through the senses.

	|58.~  Beatrice's simple (if loaded) question brings forth ninety
verses of response.

	|59-60.~  Dante restates (as Beatrice knew he would) his previous
argument, found in ^Convivio~ II.xiii.9, that the dark places in the
Moon are the result of rarer matter (which does not reflect the sun's
rays as well as denser matter does) in the surface of the Moon.
However, and as Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. vv. 59-60), the
protagonist has here gone deeper into error by making this phenomenon
more inclusive and even, perhaps, general, using the plural in line 60,
^corpi~, and thus indicating other celestial bodies in addition to the
Moon.

Where most critics believe Dante's source for this view is Averro,es,
Andr$e P$ezard, as is duly reported by Sapegno in his introductory note
to his commentary on this canto, believes it lies in the ^Roman de la
Rose~ (vv. 16803-16850 [ed. Lecoy], vv. 16833-16880 [tr. Dahlberg]).
And Vasoli ("Il canto II del ^Paradiso~," in ^Lectura Dantis
Metelliana: I primi undici canti del "Paradiso"~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 1992
{1972}], p. 36) cites P$ezard (Andr$e P$ezard, ed., Dante Alighieri,
^Oeuvres compl@etes~ [Paris: Gallimard, 1965], pp. 1377-78) for Jean de
Meun's passage with its view of the moonspots.  What is most
fascinating about Jean's words to the student of the ^Commedia~ is how
clearly reflected they seem to be in Dante's.  (And the closeness is
all the more arresting because ^Il Fiore~ contains no similar passage;
there can be no question of the ^Roman~'s direct influence on Dante
here, no question that Dante is here citing a putative earlier self in
^Il Fiore~.)  In the ^Roman~, Nature, confessing to Genius, resolves
the question of the moon spots more or less precisely as Dante had in
^Convivio~: "It seems to men that the moon (^la lune~) may indeed not
be clean and pure (^necte et pure~), because in some places it shows up
dark (^obscure~).  But it is because of its double nature that it
appears opaque and cloudy (^espesse et trouble~) in some places...
because it is both clear and opaque (^clere et espesse~)...."  Jean is
arguing that  the Moon has two kinds of matter, clear and opaque, and
that the sun's beams pass right through the clear but are reflected by
the opaque; and then, beginning at verse 16825 (16855 in Dahlberg's
translation), Nature, like Beatrice, turns to experimental means of
demonstration: "But if one took lead, or something dense ^(plom ou
quelque chose espesse)~ that does not allow rays to pass through, and
placed oneself on the side opposite to that from which the sun's rays
come, the form would return immediately."  It is difficult to believe
that Dante did not have this passage in mind when he developed his own
discussion, also involving "experimental science," if coming up with a
very different solution, one that objects strenuously to the mere
physicality of Nature's explanation, as we shall see.  Thus, if Dante
reveals his knowledge of the French text here, he does not reveal
himself as an uncritical admirer.

This discussion touches on one of the great unresolved issues
confronting readers of the ^Commedia~: Dante's knowledge of the Old
French masterpiece of Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun.  To deal
with the state of the unresolved issue briefly, we should be aware of
at least three possible answers to the spiny question: (1) ^Il Fiore~
is indeed by Dante, and thus he knew the ^Roman~ from his youth (since
the latter work is a sort of free translation of passages from the Old
French work) and Contini -- as do almost all who make the ^Fiore~ a
part of Dante's bibliography -- places it very early in Dante's career,
in the 1280s or, at the latest, in the early 1290s [see Luciano Rossi
("Dante, la ^Rose~ e il ^Fiore~," in ^Studi sul canone letterario del
Trecento: Per Michelangelo Picone~, a cura di J. Bartuschat and L.
Rossi [Ravenna: Longo, 2003], p. 20).  (2) ^Il Fiore~ was indeed read
by Dante, but someone else wrote it, which explains why he cites this
Italian "translation" of the ^Rose~ (for some textual resonances of ^Il
Fiore~ in the ^Commedia~, see ^ED~ II [1970], pp. 898-900) but not the
original; there is thus no direct relationship between the French work
and Dante's.  (3) Another view would hold that, beginning with this
passage, Dante, who earlier had ^read~ (but not written) ^Il Fiore~,
reveals his recent reading of the ^Roman~, a text that he encountered
only after he had finished composing ^Purgatorio~.

In recent years the dispute has intensified, even in Italy, where,
while Contini, much of whose later life was devoted to demonstrating
Dantean authorship, remained among the living, dissenting voices were
not very often heard.  The writer remembers vividly a taxi ride across
Florence in the 1990s in which the widely respected and now deceased
German ^dantista~, Marcella Roddewig, asked, in a whisper, whether her
taxi-sharer thought Dante was the author of ^Il Fiore~; when he said
that he did not think so, it was as though he had opened his attach$e
case, revealing a hand grenade to be hurled against a common foe.  See
the balanced volume, edited by Baranski and Boyde (^The "Fiore" in
Context: Dante, France, Tuscany~ [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame
Press, 1997]), devoted in part to the question of the work's
authorship.  See also Lino Leonardi ("'Langue' poetica e stile dantesco
nel ^Fiore~: per una verifica degli 'argomenti interni,'" in ^Studi di
filologia medievale in onore di d'Arco Silvio Avalle~ [Milan:
Ricciardi, 1996], pp. 237-91), who believes the work is authentic; Enzo
Quaglio ("Per l'antica fortuna del ^Fiore~," ^Rivista di Studi
Danteschi~ 1 [2001]: 120-127), who deals with the problem of a later
citation (dating from 1375) that appears to be from another MS. than
the ^unicum~ of Montpellier; Enrico Malato (^Dante~ [Rome: Salerno,
1999], pp. 138-48), considering arguments ^pro et contra~, and tending
toward a negative view; and Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le figure del
vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001], p.
43), denying Dantean authorship.  For what had earlier become the
standard view and the basic bibliography, see Gianfranco Contini,
^Fiore, Il~ (^ED~ II [1970]), pp. 895-901; and for a listing of some
more agnostic views, see Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New
Haven: Yale University Press, 2001], pp. 182-83).  More recently, we
have Luciano Rossi's attempt to start the investigation over again
("Dante, la ^Rose~ e il ^Fiore~," in ^Studi sul canone letterario del
Trecento: Per Michelangelo Picone~, a cura di J. Bartuschat and L.
Rossi [Ravenna: Longo, 2003], pp. 9-32), reminding us of his senior
colleague's early attempt to accomplish a similar task: Picone's
remarks on the problems of attribution ("Il ^Fiore~: struttura profonda
e problemi attributivi," ^Vox romanica~ 33 [1974]: 145-56).  The most
recent discussion is found in an essay by Olivia Holmes ("Dante's
Choice and Romance Narratives of Two Beloveds," ^Dante Studies~ 121
[2003 {2006}]: 109-47).

	|61-63.~  Beatrice begins with a sweeping denunciation of Dante's
position in a thoroughly Scholastic manner, making clear the nature of
the thesis that she will set about to destroy (Dante's hypothesis
regarding alternating layers of rarity and density).  For this tercet
as reflecting the poet's disavowal of his earlier Averroist views of
the issue, see Cassell (^The "Monarchia" Controversy: An Historical
Study with Accompanying Translations of Dante Alighieri's "Monarchia,"
Guido Vernani's "Refutation of the 'Monarchia' Composed by Dante," and
Pope John XXII's Bull "Si fratrum"~ [Washington, D.C.: Catholic
University of America Press, 2004]), pp. 54-55.

	|64-148.~  See Russo (^Esperienze e/di letture dantesche [tra il 1966 e
il 1970]~ [Naples: Liguori, 1971], pp. 103-58, 161-208), for an
impassioned defense of the poetic qualities of such lengthy and
ostensibly "scientific" or "philosophical" passages as this one, which
he links with the only slightly shorter lesson in embryology offered up
by Statius (^Purg~. XXV.37-108).  For a careful study of the central
theological and scientific issues here and the history of their
reception among Dante's critics, see Vasoli ("Il canto II del
^Paradiso~," in ^Lectura Dantis Metelliana: I primi undici canti del
"Paradiso"~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 1992 {1972}], pp. 27-51).  A summary of
this lengthy argument may be found in Grandgent, as cited by Singleton
(comm. ^Par~. II.52-148).  And for an immensely helpful basic
bibliography on Dante in relation to the various sciences that make
their presence felt in the poem, see the extended note by Simon Gilson
("Medieval Science in Dante's ^Commedia~: Past Approaches and Future
Directions," ^Reading Medieval Studies~ 27 [2001]: 58-65).  For a
useful review of some current writing on Dante's knowledge and use of
the sciences, with bibliography, see Ledda ("Poesia, scienza e critica
dantesca," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001]: 99-113).

	|64-72.~  The first part of Beatrice's discourse attacks the notion
(introduced by Dante in verse 60) that various stars in the Starry
Sphere shine brighter or less bright and, indeed, have other
distinguishing characteristics (e.g. color, size, shape), simply
because they are more or less dense.  This would make the
differentiating power single, and would be at odds with what we know of
the variety of God's formal principles.  So much for the larger issue
at stake here.  For discussion of the passage, see Moore (^Studies in
Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968
{1903}], pp. 87-91).

	|73-105.~  Turning to the phenomenon itself, Beatrice adduces two
arguments to destroy Dante's position, the first involving two points
(vv. 73-82), the second, a single one (vv. 83-105), building on the
second point in the first argument, an extended disproof by imagined
experiment.

	|73-82.~  If the dark spots on the Moon were the result of rarer
matter, then matter rare and dense would be distributed either randomly
or in strips, as meat and fat in creatures or pages in a book.  For
this second image, vv. 77-78, see Hatcher ("The Moon and Parchment:
^Paradiso~ II, 73-78," ^Dante Studies~ 89 [1971]: 55-60).  Were the
first case true (i.e., were there "holes" without density in the Moon),
we would verify that fact during eclipses of the Sun; and, since we
cannot, Beatrice says, we must look to the second possible cause put
forward by Dante.

For studies of the problem presented by the dark spots on the Moon, see
Paget Toynbee, "Dante's Theories as to the Spots on the Moon" (in his
^Dante Studies and Researches~ [Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press,
1971 {1902}], pp. 78-86) for a discussion of possible sources and of
some of the confusion caused by the passage.  See also Manlio Pastore
Stocchi ("Dante e la luna," ^Lettere Italiane~ 33 [1981]: 153-74).  And
see Nardi ("Il canto delle macchie lunari [II ^Par~.]," ^L'Alighieri~
26 [1985]: 21-32), Stabile ("Il Canto II del ^Paradiso~," in
^"Paradiso": Letture degli anni 1979-81~, ed. S. Zennaro [Rome:
Bonacci, 1989], pp. 47-55 & nn.), and Picone ("Il corpo della/nella
luna: sul canto II del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 15 [2000]: 21-25).

	|83-90.~  If then, Beatrice reasons, there are no "holes" for the Sun's
light to come through, we must hypothesize the presence of dense matter
that will act as a mirror for whatever light has penetrated the rare
matter beneath the Moon's surface.

	|91-93.~  Dante will object, Beatrice says, that the farther
reflection, because of its greater distance, will seem dimmer, a
proposition that she will spend four tercets tearing down.

	|94-105.~  In Aristotelian manner, Beatrice extols the virtue of
experiment.  In this "thought experiment" that she proposes for Dante
to perform, the two equidistant mirrors (one of which is, strictly
speaking, unnecessary) represent the surface of the Moon, while the one
set farther back stands in for the indented portion, where the dense
part begins.  The three lights reflected in the mirror will show equal
brightness, if not equal size.  Thus, as Beatrice clearly means to
instruct Dante, the quality of the light is not affected by distance;
only the quantity is.

For a discussion of this passage and the significance of mirrors in
^Paradiso~, see Miller ("Three Mirrors of Dante's ^Paradiso~,"
^University of Toronto Quarterly~ 46 [1977]: 263-79).  See also Tate
("The Symbolic Imagination: A Meditation on Dante's Three Mirrors," in
^Discussions of the "Divine Comedy,"~ ed. Irma Brandeis [Boston: Heath,
1961], pp. 102-11), offering a first "Trinitarian" reading of the third
experimentally unnecessary mirror.  Boyde ("L'esegesi di Dante e la
scienza," in ^Dante e la scienza~, ed. P. Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna:
Longo, 1995], pp. 14-16), actually performed a version of the
experiment in order to test Dante's method (it passed his test).  Simon
Gilson ("Dante and the Science of 'Perspective': A Reappraisal," ^Dante
Studies~ 115 [1997]: 204-6), discusses various other similar
"experiments" described by earlier writers (Pseudo-Thomas on the
^Meteorologica~, Chalcidius on the ^Timaeus~, Roger Bacon, Albert the
Great on the ^De causis~), concluding that, while Albert's is the
closest to Dante's, in this (as in so much else) Dante simply cannot be
pinned down.  And now see Turelli ("'Dopo il dosso / ti stea un lume'
[Par. II 97-105]: Beatrice, un progetto fisico sperimentale,"
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 5 [2004]: 321-24), in polemic against
Kleiner (^Mismapping the Underworld: Daring and Error in Dante's
"Comedy"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994], p. 105 (Kleiner
believes that "dopo il dosso" means "directly behind your back," thus
making the experiment literally impossible).  But see Landino's gloss
to vv. 100-108; he simply (and understandably) assumes that the light
is ^above~ the experimenter's head ("et sopra el capo tuo ti sia un
lume").  In our own time, Turelli convincingly defends the experimental
"correctness" of Beatrice's verbal demonstration; Moevs (^The
Metaphysics of Dante's "Comedy"~ [Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2005], p. 115, however, accepts Kleiner's presupposition, arguing that
in the thought experiment we must realize that Dante possesses --
meaningfully, of course -- a transparent body.  On the other hand, see
the second version of this "experiment" in the poem (at ^Par~.
XXVIII.4-9), where the same conditions pertain and the reader once
again feels justified in making Landino's assumption.

	|106-111.~  Beatrice turns to simile (one of the fairly infrequent
occasions on which the poet puts the simile-forging power into the
hands of a character [but cf. ^Inf~. XXVII.94-97]): As the Sun's rays
reduce snow to its underlying essence (water), stripping it of its
accidental qualities (cold, whiteness), so Beatrice's mind will rid
Dante's intellect of its improper qualities and return it to its
original condition.

	|112-114.~  Going back, in thought, to the Beginning, the Empyrean,
Beatrice turns her attention to the Primum Mobile, the ninth sphere,
where nothing may be seen but where all the powers that course through
the universe have their origins in space and time.  See ^Convivio~
II.xiv.15: "For, as the Philosopher says in the fifth book of the
Ethics, 'legal justice disposes the sciences for our learning, and
commands that they be learned and taught in order that they not be
forsaken'; so with its movement ^the aforesaid heaven governs the daily
revolution of all the others~, by which every day they all receive and
transmit here below the virtue of all their parts" (tr. R. Lansing,
italics added).

	|115-117.~  The sphere of the Fixed Stars is where the angelic powers,
undifferentiated in the Primum Mobile, are differentiated among the
stars.  It is from here that they exercise their influence on earth.

	|118-120.~  Perhaps it is best to follow Bosco/Reggio's interpretation
of this difficult tercet, which they understand in light of lines from
^Purgatorio~ XXX.109-110: "Not only by the working of the wheels above
/ that urge each seed to a certain end...."  They argue that this
tercet then means that the seven lower heavens (after the Primum Mobile
and the Starry Sphere) dispose in diverse ways the various essences or
powers that they receive from the Starry Sphere, adapting them to their
own precise purposes.

	|121-123.~  These "organs" of the universe, resembling in their
workings the effective parts of the human body, as Dante now
understands, take their powers from the realms closest to God and
disperse them below.

	|124-126.~  Beatrice's admonition prepares Dante to do his own
reasoning (and do better than he has done so far).  If he learns from
this experience, he will not only understand the principle that
explains the phenomenon of the moonspots, but other things as well.

	|127-129.~  Only now does Beatrice turn her attention to the angels
("the bless@ed movers"), the artisans of all creation.   Up to now we
have heard her speak exclusively of the incorruptible material
universe; now we find out what animates it.

	|130-132.~  And the Starry Sphere, into the stars of which the powers
are distributed, receives that imprinting from the Intelligences
(angels) in the Primum Mobile.  There is a possible ambiguity here, as
Dante uses the singular (^mente profonda~) either to indicate the
Cherubim (the angels of knowledge) or all nine angelic orders, as the
context would seem to demand.

	|133-138.~  The "dust" that in Genesis (3:19 ["pulvis es, et in
pulverem reverteris"]) is our flesh is seen here as activated in its
various members by the angelic intelligences -- unless we are once
again to take the singular (^intelligenza~ -- verse 136) at face value
(see the note to vv. 130-132), in which case Beatrice is speaking only
of the Cherubim, which seems unlikely.

	|139-141.~  The undivided power of primal angelic intelligence (found
in the ninth sphere), descending, makes a different union with each
star that it animates, similar to the way in which it binds with human
souls.  For this notion, Pietrobono (comm. to this tercet) cites
^Convivio~ II.v.18: "These movers by their intellect alone produce the
revolution in that proper subject which each one moves.  The most noble
form of heaven, which has in itself the principle of this passive
nature, revolves at the touch of the motive power which understands it;
and by touch I mean contact, though not in a bodily sense, with the
virtue which is directed toward it" (tr. R. Lansing).

Fraccaroli ("Dante e il ^Timeo~," in ^Il Timeo~, tr. Giuseppe
Fraccaroli [Turin: Fratelli Bocca, 1906], pp. 391-424) offers these
verses as an example of Dante's frequent divergence from the text of
Plato's ^Timaeus~ when it counters the opinions of Aristotle
(Fraccaroli is among those scholars who believe that Dante actually
knew the text of that work in Chalcidius's translation rather than from
some other intermediary -- see the note to ^Par~. IV.24).  In Plato,
the stars are self-propelled.

	|142-144.~  The greater or lesser effulgence of a star results from the
conjoined qualities that a particular star has in conjunction with the
informing virtues, or powers, of its angelic informant.  And this is
the answer to Dante's quandary.  He had attempted to analyze the
moonspots in physical terms; Beatrice has just accounted for them in
metaphysical ones (notably poetic though these are, comparing the
relative brightness of/in a heavenly body to the relative brightness in
a joyful eye, an ocular smile, as it were).

	|145-148.~  The difference between light and dark in heavenly bodies is
not to be accounted for quantitatively, in terms of density/rarity, but
qualitatively, by the amount of angelic potency found in a given body.
