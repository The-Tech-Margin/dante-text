	|1-6.~  The reader -- at least on a second reading -- may admire 
Dante's insistence on his authorial freedom in not marking the border 
between Malebolge and the ninth Circle at the canto's edge.  Instead, 
with another classical simile (and Momigliano, comm. to vv. 4-6, notes 
the large numbers of classical allusions sprinkled through Cantos 
XXVIII-XXXI), he delays the transition until verse 7.

	Virgil's rebuke in ^Inferno~ XXX.130-132 had both caused Dante 
embarrassment and supplied the antidote: his blush of shame (which 
reassured Virgil of his charge's moral development).  The most likely 
source for Dante's reference to the lance of Achilles, which had the 
magical property of curing with a second touch the very wound that it 
had caused, is ^Remedia amoris~ I.43-44: 'The Pelian spear [in Dante's 
understanding, the spear of Peleus?] that once had wounded his enemy, 
the son of Hercules [Telephus], also brought comfort to the wound,' a 
tale presented as being of somewhat dubious provenance, as another one 
of those pagan yarns ('so I have heard it told').  For some of the 
problems associated with this text see Singleton's commentary (to 
^Inf~. XXXI.5).  Ovid in fact refers to the spear given by Chiron, the 
centaur (see ^Inf~. XII.71), who lived on Mt. Pelion, to Achilles 
himself.  At least one other medieval poet before Dante, Bernard de 
Ventadour, had referred to the weapon as belonging first to Peleus.  
Dante knew that Peleus was the father of Achilles, from, if nowhere 
else, Statius, ^Achilleid~ I.90.

	The word ^mancia~ in v. 6 has caused debate.  Most commentators 
believe it merely means 'gift' (in modern Italian, the tip, e.g., for a 
waiter); some, following Andr$e P$ezard (e.g., Bosco/Reggio, comm. to 
verse 6) believe it comes from chivalric custom, the sleeve (^manica~) 
that a lady might present to her knight if he won his joust.

	|7-13.~  The departure from Malebolge and arrival in the penumbral 
murk of the last circle is anything but dramatic.  Here nothing is 
distinct until Dante hears a horn-blast.  We shall eventually learn 
that this is sounded by Nimrod (verse 77).

	|16-18.~  The reference to the ^Chanson de Roland~, a text that, 
Giovanni Cecchetti reminds us, Dante knew in a form probably most 
unlike anything we read today ("^Inferno~ XXXI," ^Lectura Dantis 
[virginiana]~ 6 ([supplement] 1990, p. 409), is the reader's first sure 
sign that we are in the realm of treachery, not mere 'simple fraud.'  
As John Scott points out ("Treachery in Dante," in ^Studies in the 
Italian Renaissance: Essays in Memory of Arnolfo B. Ferruolo~ [Naples: 
Societ@a Editrice Napoletana, 1985]), pp. 29-30, for most medieval 
readers there was perhaps no act of worse betrayal than that of Ganelon 
(punished in the next canto, ^Inf~. XXXII.122), whose treacherous act, 
in 778, was directed against Charlemagne, the future emperor (crowned 
in Rome on Christmas Day in 800) and future saint (canonized in 1165, 
exactly one hundred years before Dante's birth); he betrayed 
Charlemagne's rear guard to the Saracen invaders.  Roland blew 
Oliphant, his horn, too late to bring back Charlemagne and his troops, 
miles distant, in time to save his part of the army, all of whom were 
slaughtered at Roncesvalles by the Saracens.  Reminded of that blast, 
we know we are among the treacherous.

	The parallels set up by the scene are interesting.  If Nimrod plays 
the role of Roland, his horn-blast is timely enough to prevent the 
entrance of the 'invaders,' Dante and Virgil, but equally ineffectual.  
There is an 'emperor' in this scene, too, 'lo 'mperador del doloroso 
regno' (the emperor of the the woeful kingdom), Satan (^Inf~. 
XXXIV.28).  And Nimrod's blast is meant to warn the Satanic forces of 
the advent of the enemy, as Roland's was.  Who is the Ganelon of the 
scene?  Antaeus, who will 'betray' his lord by helping Dante and Virgil 
descend into Satan's stronghold.  If all these inverse parallels work, 
we have to add another: Dante and Virgil are the Saracens in this 
series of analogies by contrary.

	|19-27.~  Dante's confusion, as he peers through the mist, causes him 
to take giants for towers.  If we ever come to believe, as very few do, 
that Cervantes had read Dante, this scene will serve as one of the 
strongest pieces of evidence, since Quijote makes the obverse mistake, 
taking windmills for giants.  For the medieval works on optics that lie 
behind the description of Dante's misperceptions here, see Peter Dronke 
("The Giants in Hell," in his ^Dante and Medieval Latin Traditions~ 
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986]), p. 36.

	|28-33.~  Virgil, as gently and reassuringly as he can, prepares Dante 
to behold the giants.  As the guardians of this zone of Hell, as the 
most proximate servants of Satan, as it were, the giants are seen to 
represent the sin of pride.  That is how Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, 
comm. to verse 31) saw them centuries ago: 'Gigantes figurative pro 
superbis accipiuntur' (The giants are to be figuratively understood as 
those who are prideful).  And that is how John Scott sees them today 
("Treachery in Dante," in ^Studies in the Italian Renaissance: Essays 
in Memory of Arnolfo B. Ferruolo~ [Naples: Societ@a Editrice 
Napoletana, 1985], p. 29).

	|34-39.~  The second simile of the canto is without classical 
decoration.  It involves improving sight, whether because a mist 
gradually lifts or because a walker gets closer to the indistinct 
object he examines from afar.

	|40-45.~  The third simile compares the looming giants with the towers 
of the fortified town, Monteriggioni, a Sienese outpost situated on the 
road between Florence and Siena.  In the thirteenth century its 
defensive walls were supplemented by fourteen towers, each over sixty 
feet in height.

	For the attempt of the giants to overthrow the Olympian gods, referred 
to obliquely here, see note at vv. 94-96.

	|49-57.~  Dante's meditation on the handiwork of Nature, God's child 
(see ^Inf~. XI.99-105), can only be taken seriously, by a modern 
reader, when one considers that, according to Genesis 6:4, once 'giants 
walked the earth.'  Nature, as implementer of God's design, is 'more 
cautious and more just' because she now fashions her largest creatures 
without intelligence, thus better protecting humans.

	|58-66.~  The anatomy of the giants, visible from only above their 
waists, since the the bank forms a sort of apron, or 'fig leaf' 
(^perizoma~ -- see the word in Genesis 3:7 for them), is described from 
the head down, to their shoulders ('where men make fast their cloaks'), 
to their waists.  The giant's head, which resembles the bronze pine 
cone Dante might well have seen in Rome in 1301 in the Vatican, is 
about eleven feet in height.  Three Frieslanders, reputed to be among 
the tallest of men, standing on one another's shoulders, would have 
reached merely from the bank to the bottom of his locks, some 
twenty-two feet, if we allow the topmost Frieslander to reach up with 
an arm toward that hair.  This leaves a foot or two of neck unmeasured. 
 Further, Dante himself, measuring by eye, thinks that the distance 
from the bank to the giant's shoulders is some thirty spans (the space 
covered by an outstretched hand), also some twenty-two feet.  Dante 
indicates that the giant is about thirty-five feet tall measured from 
the waist, his mid-point, and thus some seventy feet in all.  One 
senses his amusement at the reader who will do this calculation.

	|67.~  The garbled speech that issues from Nimrod's mouth has caused a 
veritable orgy of interpretive enthusiasm.  (The reader should be aware 
that we are not at all sure about what these words looked like when 
they left Dante's pen; as nonsense, they may have caused more scribal 
confusion than others.  Hence, any attempt to 'construe' them should be 
extremely cautious, which has certainly not been the case.  (Berthier, 
in his commentary to vv. 67-69, speaks of a poem of Rutebeuf, 'Le 
miracle de Th$eophile,' in which the earlier French poet also uses 
unintelligible words to represent demonic speech.)  Dante has variously 
been assumed to have known more Aremaic or Arabic or Hebrew than he 
likely could have, and to have deployed this arcane knowledge in 
creating a meaningful phrase.  For a review of various attempts to make 
these words 'make sense,' with bibliography, see Ettore Caccia, 
'Raph@el ma@i am@ecche zab@i; almi' (ED.1973.4).  And 
see the note to ^Inferno~ VII.1, where Plutus also speaks five garbled 
words.  While it is nearly certainly true that we are not meant to be 
able to understand Nimrod's words (that is the point Virgil makes, 
after all), it is nonetheless likely that they, like those of Plutus, 
should be seen as corrupted versions of words that do make sense.  
'Raphel' can hardly fail to remind us of the name of the archangel 
Raphael, 'ma@i' seems a version of the Italian word for 'ever' (or 
'never'), 'am@ecche' could be a series of simple words (^a me che~: 
'to,' 'me,' 'that'), 'zab@i' sounds like a slide into dialectal 
speech, and 'almi' is perfectly good Italian for 'holy,' 'divine.'  The 
point is not that these words make any sense; it is rather that they do 
not.  Like Plutus's outburst, they are meant to be understood as 
corrupted speech.  And, as was true in that case, they are intended to 
keep these intruders out of the place this guardian has been posted to 
guard.  See Alberto Chiari ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Scaligera~, dir. Mario Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1962)]), 
p. 1107, who argues that Nimrod's cry is the product of anger and 
menace common to all infernal guardians.

	These five words may refer to St. Paul's desire that the Corinthians 
speak five words with understanding rather than ten thousand in tongues 
(I Corinthians 14:19), as was first noted by Andr$e P$ezard ("Le Chant 
des g$eants," ^Bulletin de la Soci$et$e d'$etudes dantesques du Centre 
universitaire m$editerran$een~ 7 [1958]), p. 59; he was supported by 
one commentator, Giacalone in 1968 (comm. to verse 69), and then by 
Kleinhenz ("Dante's Towering Giants," ^Romance Philology~ 27 [1974]), 
p. 283n.  Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with 
understanding~," Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and 
Early Renaissance Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and 
Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992]) attempts to take this 'program' 
into passages in ^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~.

	For the importance to Dante of St. Paul, who does not appear as a 
personage in the ^Commedia~, see Angelo Penna and Giovanni Fallani, 
'Paolo, San' (ED.1973.4); Giorgio Petrocchi, "San Paolo in Dante," in 
^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan (Florence: Olschki, 1988), pp. 
235-48.

	|69.~  That Dante refers to this fallen speech as 'psalms' (^salmi~), 
even negatively, reminds the reader that Nimrod's words reflect the 
divine origin of language, if we hear it now in its postlapsarian 
condition.

	|70-81.~  Virgil's stinging remarks to Nimrod (which are in fact quite 
amusing) have drawn puzzled response from some commentators.  Why does 
Virgil address Nimrod, since the giant cannot understand him?  Or are 
his words meant only for Dante?  Some complain that it is like speaking 
to an animal for him to speak to this creature.  Precisely so.  And we 
humans do this all the time.  It matters not at all that Nimrod cannot 
understand.  The reader can.

	Virgil treats Nimrod like a drunk at a New Year's Eve party, telling 
him to give over attempts at speech and to content himself with blowing 
his horn.  Referring to the giant's rage, he underlines the 
oppositional intent of his outburst; calling him 'creature of 
confusion' (^anima confusa~), he probably alludes to the 'confusion of 
tongues' that followed in the wake of the building of the Tower of 
Babel.  Before dismissing Nimrod as unworthy of further speech, Virgil 
makes this association clear.  In Genesis Nimrod was not a giant, but 
'a mighty hunter before the Lord' (Genesis 10:9).  It is probably to 
St. Augustine, who mentions him three times in ^De civitate Dei~ XVI as 
a giant, that we owe Dante's decision to do so as well.  The building 
of the Tower and the resultant 'confusion' of language (Genesis 11:1-9) 
was, for Dante, one of the defining moments in the history of human 
language, the 'linguistic fall' described there paralleling the fall of 
Adam and Eve.  See Arno Borst (^Der Turmbau von Babel~, 3 vols. 
[Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 1957-60], vol. II, pp. 869-75), for Dante's 
place in the history of responses to the building of the tower.

	Nimrod will be referred to by name twice more in the poem (^Purg~. 
XII.34; ^Par~. XXVI.126), so that he is mentioned once in each 
^cantica~.  For this phenomenon, words that appear a single time in 
each ^cantica~, see Hollander ("An Index of Hapax Legomena in Dante's 
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988]), pp. 108-10.

	|84-90.~  The second of the three giants whom we see in this canto (we 
shall hear of three others) will be identified shortly (v. 94) as 
Ephialtes.  Unlike Nimrod, too stupid to be dangerous, this one, bigger 
still and far more fierce, is capable of the harm that the poet feared 
in vv. 55-57.

	|91-96.~  Ephialtes was one of the giants who attempted, by piling 
Pelion on Ossa, to scale Olympus and overthrow the gods.  He and his 
fellow rebels were killed by Jove at Phlegra (^Inf~. XIV.58).  He is 
referred to by Virgil along with his twin brother Otus at ^Aeneid~ 
VI.582, but only as the (unnamed) twin adoptive sons of Aloeus, 
engendered in Iphimedia by Neptune.  Virgil names them at ^Culex~ 
234-235.  For the presence of Ephialtes in various classical texts, 
beginning with Homer, see Scartazzini, comm. to verse 94.  Tozer (1901) 
and Torraca (1905) both suggest that Dante might have read his name in 
Servius's comment on Georgics I.280.

	|97-105.~  Dante wants to see Briareus because he has read about him 
in the (^Aen~. X.565-567): he has a hundred arms and hands and breathes 
fire from fifty mouths and breasts.  It is important to note that 
Virgil himself apologizes for this account: ^dicunt~, he says, 'or so 
they say,' the same tactic that Dante has used when warning us against 
the excesses of pagan myth-making when he imports it to his own poem 
(see ^Inf~. XXIX.63; ^Inf~. XXXI.4).  Dante, however, wants to have 
some fun at his fellow poet's expense.  Briareus, Virgil explains (like 
a host who does not want to produce a particularly embarrassing guest 
at a party), is ^way~ up ahead there, and he looks just like Ephialtes, 
anyway.  What Dante has made his ^auctor~ do is to apologize for 
including such unbelievable rot in the divine ^Aeneid~, while allowing 
Virgil to escape the discomfort of actually having to gaze upon the 
'normal,' Dantean version of a proper giant, human in everything but 
his size.  Most commentators do not perceive the humor of this moment.  
However, for sense of Dante's playfulness here, see Andreoli in 1856 
(comm. to vv. 98-99) and Trucchi in 1936 (comm. to vv. 97-99).

	Not only is Antaeus a 'normal' giant (we see what Dante has gotten us 
to assent to by overruling 'excessive' gigantism -- this is a game 
played endlessly in ^Don Quijote~ -- an acceptance of 'normal' 
gigantism), but he is a relatively friendly one, unfettered, we assume, 
because he did not fight against the gods at Phlegra.  Satan never 
should have taken him on.  Nimrod is ineffective, but at least he 
^tries~; Ephialtes has the right stuff; but this Antaeus is a total 
loser.  As soon as God knew he didn't need to bind him, Satan should 
have found a meaner giant.  The son of Neptune and Gea, Earth, Antaeus 
was invincible in combat so long as he remained in contact with earth.  
Hercules, discovering this, was able to hold him free from the earth 
and kill him, crushing him in his hands.

	|108.~  Ephialtes is angry, either because he thinks Virgil and Dante 
will have more success with Antaeus or because Virgil has said that 
Briareus looks even meaner than he.

	|113-114.~  The size of Antaeus's upper body, not including his head, 
is seven ells, about twenty-two feet, thus roughly the same as Nimrod's.

	|115-124.~  Virgil begins by referring to the battle of Zama in 202 
B.C., where Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal (revenge for the battle 
of Cannae in 216 -- see ^Inf~. XXVIII.9-11), thus successfully 
concluding the second Punic War, which had begun so badly.  Needless to 
say, this (for Dante and any Roman-minded reader) great victory is 
hardly of a comparable magnitude to that of a giant capturing a lot of 
lions.  Thus the reference to Zama offers a back-handed compliment to 
Antaeus, who killed his lions in the same place that Scipio defeated 
Hannibal.  Scipio's importance for Dante is mirrored in the fact that 
he reappears by name three times in the poem: ^Purg~. XXIX.117, ^Par~. 
VI.53, ^Par~. XXVII.61.

	Virgil finds himself in a difficult situation.  As was not the case 
with Ulysses, when Virgil could boast that he had written of his 
exploits (even if not very favorably, he ^had~ at least written of the 
Greek hero -- see ^Inf~. XXVI.80-82), he has not written about Antaeus 
at all.  To make matters worse, he ^did~ once mention a certain 
Antaeus, a soldier in Turnus's ranks, mowed down by Aeneas in his 
Achilles-like battlefield fury in ^Aeneid~ X.561.  And, still worse, 
this mention of an Antaeus who is merely a walk-on corpse in Virgil's 
poem precedes by only four lines Virgil's mention of Briareus (see the 
note to ^Inf~.XXXI.97-105).  And so here is a poet who has, 
intrinsically at least, insulted the giant whom he now wants to cajole. 
 What is he to do?  What he does is borrow from Lucan (of course only 
^we~ know that he is accomplishing this chronologically impossible 
feat) in order to praise Antaeus.  It was Lucan, not Virgil, who told 
the tale of Antaeus the lion-killer (^Phars~. IV.601-602), and it was 
Lucan, not Virgil, who explicitly compared Antaeus favorably to 
Briareus, not to mention Typhon and Tityus (the two other giants of 
whom we are about to hear at v. 124).  See ^Phars~. IV.595-597): Gea 
had more reason to boast of this gigantic son, Antaeus, than of the 
others, Typhon, or Tityus, or fierce Briareus; and she was merciful to 
the gods when she did not set loose Antaeus on the field at Phlegra.  
(This detail offers the matter for Virgil's second instance of the 
greatness of Antaeus.)  It can hardly be coincidental that all four of 
the giants present in Virgil's speech here are also together in Lucan's 
text.  And so Virgil's two gestures toward Antaeus are both taken from 
Lucan.  It is an extraordinarily amusing moment; one can imagine how 
Dante smiled as he composed it.  Nonetheless, many of his commentators 
vehemently deny that this passage is ironic.  It is difficult to see 
with what justice they do so.  For what has Virgil really said to 
Antaeus?  'You killed a lot of lions right near the place where Rome 
won one of its greatest military victories; you didn't fight at the 
battle in which your brothers were killed by the gods.'

	|125-132.~  Virgil's ^captatio benevolentiae~ has not been successful. 
 Antaeus still needs persuading.  Dante, Virgil tells him, can do what 
he didn't do: make Antaeus famous.  Perhaps Antaeus was a better reader 
of classical texts than some imagine; his lip was still curled with 
disdain after Virgil's praise had ended.  Fame is the spur; Antaeus 
bends and grasps Virgil, in a benevolent replay of his own death scene, 
when Hercules held him in ^his~ hands.

	|136-141.~  The fourth and last simile of the canto refers to one of 
two towers (the shorter one, in fact, but the one that 'leans' the 
most) built in Bologna in 1109 and 1110.  Towers and giants have pride 
in common, and so the comparison is not without its moral reasons.  Its 
visual reasons are indisputably stunning, a tower that seems to be 
falling because a cloud is passing over it.

	Michelangelo Picone ("La torre della ragione: per un sonetto 
dantesco," in ^Carmina semper et citharae cordi. Etudes de philologie 
et de m$etrique offertes @a Aldo Menichetti~, $ed. par M.Cl. 
G$erard-Zai et al. [Geneva: Slatkine, 2000], pp. 291-300) has now 
interpreted the 'allegory' of Dante's sonnet about the Garisenda tower 
of Bologna, number 51 in Barbi's collection of Dante's ^Rime,~ as 
follows: just as Dante looks at the smaller (and not the greater) of 
the two towers in Bologna, just so he looked at another lesser woman 
and not at Beatrice.

	|142-143.~  For the tradition of hell as a devouring mouth, reflected 
in these verses, see Sonia Gentili ("'Ut canes infernales': Cerbero e 
le Arpie in Dante," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: tradizione 
e simbologie~ [Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo, 
1997]), pp. 177-82.  And for a larger, more speculative, view, one that 
holds that hell is programmatically modeled on the shape of the human 
body (with the last Circle as the anus), see Durling ("Deceit and 
Digestion in the Belly of Hell," in ^Allegory and Representation: 
Selected Papers from the English Institute, 1979-80~, ed. Stephen A. 
Greenblatt [Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981], pp. 
61-93).  There is a potential linguistic play in these lines ('al fondo 
che divora / Lucifero con Giuda'); given that in ^Inferno~ XXXIV.61-63 
it is Satan who 'devours' Judas, the lines almost ask to be misread as 
'al fondo in cui divora / Giuda Lucifero.'  Benvenuto's gloss to these 
verses says almost as much: 'quia in centro putei stat fixus Lucifer 
qui devorat Judam' (because in the center of the pit Lucifer is 
fastened, devouring Judas).

	There has been much debate as to where the giants stand in relation to 
the floor of Hell.  Are their feet on the floor itself or do they stand 
on a ledge above it?  See ^Inferno~ XXXII.16-18 and the related note.

	|144-145.~  No one in hell sticks around after work, neither angelic 
messenger (^Inf~. IX.100-103) nor co-operative monster (^Inf~. 
XVII.133-136).

	Guiniforto, in his comment to this passage (vv. 136-145) suggests that 
Dante must have had a small boat in mind, the mast of which may be 
raised very quickly. Others envision, perhaps drawn by the huge size of Antaeus,
the more natural similarity of a large ship's mainmast, seen righting itself
from heeling in a wind. Sapegno (comm. v. 145) allows for both possibilities.

	An entire canto has been devoted to a transition from one circle to 
the next.  We realize, once all the exuberant poetic play has stopped, 
that we are on the lowest point in Dante's universe, the floor of hell. 
 From here, everywhere is up.
