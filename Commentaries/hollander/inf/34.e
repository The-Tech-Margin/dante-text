	|1.~  The first verse of the last canto of ^Inferno~ (like the first 
verse of the last canto of ^Purgatorio~ [^Purg~. XXXIII.1]) is in 
Latin.  Its first three words are identical to the first verse of a 
hymn of the True Cross composed by Venantius Fortunatus (sixth century) 
but the last, obviously, has been added by Dante.  Satan, still in the 
distance, is naturally not 'advancing' against Dante and Virgil, but 
the wind he emits might have made it seem that way as they approach 
him.  Satan, as we shall see, is immobile.

	This is the only complete Latin verse in the ^cantica~, but see seven 
earlier Latin words or phrases (^Inf~. I.65, ^Inf~. I.70, ^Inf~. XV.62, 
^Inf~. XVI.88, ^Inf~. XVIII.6, ^Inf~. XXI.42, ^Inf~. XXVII.72).

	|4-7.~  'The Satanic mills' of William Blake may not reflect this 
passage, even as much as Blake read Dante, yet Dante's simile 
immediately presents Satan as a vast contraption doing its necessary 
work in the architect's plan for this infernal city.  We reflect that 
this was once the fairest of angels, now reduced, despite his awesome 
size, to mindless iteration of his breath.  Joan Ferrante speaks of 
'Lucifer, who emits no sound but sends forth a silent and freezing wind 
of hate, a parody perhaps of the love-inspiring tongues of flame 
brought to the Apostles by the Holy Spirit' ("The Relation of Speech to 
Sin in the ^Inferno~," ^Dante Studies~ 87 [1969], p. 38).  As 
Bosco/Reggio suggest, it is not without reason that Dante compares 
Lucifer to a machine (comm. to XXXIV.28-57).

	|8-9.~  Commentators occasionally remark that Dante has here forgotten 
the fact that insubstantial Virgil, a shade, would give Dante no 
shelter at all.  The 'rules' of the poem overrule the 'rules' of even 
his own physics if and when he chooses.  E.g., Virgil picks Dante up 
and carries him at ^Inferno~ XIX.124-125 and XXIII.37.  See the note to 
^Inferno~ VI.34-36.

	An observation of a Princeton student, Julia Salzman '02, is worth 
recording: here Dante does not move behind Virgil out of fear, but only 
to protect himself from the wind.  His progress is evident -- but Satan 
will nonetheless cause him considerable fear in a moment.

	|10.~  Since Tommaseo in 1837 (comm. to vv. 10-12) commentators have 
cited, for this verse, Aeneas's words as he tells the story of Laoco,on 
(^Aen~. II.204): 'horresco referens' (I shudder merely to tell it).  In 
the ^Aeneid~ two serpents are moving toward the priest to kill him; 
here, the Serpent is being approached by Virgil and Dante.  The 
differing context is eventually reassuring, but the protagonist is, for 
the last time in this ^cantica~, filled with fear.

	|11-12.~  For the fourth time in Cocytus the fact that we have crossed 
a boundary is made clear only by the fact that sinners are now punished 
in a different posture.  This last realm is named, of course, for 
Judas, who betrayed his rightful Lord, Jesus Christ.

	|13-15.~  The sinners here are frozen inside the ice, as though tossed 
into it helter-skelter before it froze and now stuck in their various 
postures eternally, like straw caught in molten glass in the artisan's 
shop and now fastened in that glass, a lasting imperfection in it.  
Their postures are horizontal (whether face-down or supine we cannot 
tell -- perhaps both), vertical (both head-up and head-down), or bent 
in two.  We eventually realize that in this zone we will not learn the 
identity of any of these sinners, a situation that may remind us of the 
anonymity that was insisted on for the Neutrals in ^Inferno~ III.49-51. 
 All of our attention is saved for Lucifer and the three special 
betrayers who are punished in his mouth.

	|20-21.~  Virgil uses the classical name for the king of hell, as he 
has once before (^Inf~. XI.65), and as he did in his own poem (e.g., 
^Aen~. VI.269).  This is the last time that we will hear that name, as 
we are shortly to leave his 'kingdom.'  The phrase 'Ecco Dite' here 
surely echoes the phrase used of Jesus, before he is sentenced to 
death, 'Ecce homo.'  See the note to ^Inferno~ XVII.1-3.

	|22-27.~  The last verse of this seventh and last address to the 
reader in ^Inferno~ is treated by most commentators as a triviality, 
i.e., Dante assures the reader that he was indeed half-dead (as he has 
already said).  See, for example, Bosco/Reggo (comm. to vv. 25-27: 'The 
expression simply translates... that simple and banal phrase... in 
Italian, ^mezzo morto~ [half dead].'  Does Dante need to ask us to 
exercise our wits, if we have these, in order to understand ^that~?  
The portentousness of his declaration that he cannot write what he 
became because words would fail him cannot be squared with such an 
interpretation, words for which would fail no one.  Few, however, have 
come forward with more vital readings.  Gregorio Di Siena, in his 
commentary to these verses, quotes Torricelli, who says that at this 
moment Dante is passing from the state of death to the state of living 
in God's forgiveness.  Similarly, Ernesto Trucchi, who bridles at the 
terribly uninteresting readings put forward by previous commentators, 
claims that this is the moment in which, in the protagonist, the fear 
of hell becomes the fear of God.  More recently, in their commentary 
Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 
1996, p. 544), propose the following: 'This moment is the culmination 
of the penitential imitation of Christ in the descent into hell, 
symbolically the pilgrim's death to sin, that is, the death of the "old 
man," leading to the reversal of direction from descent to ascent.'  
They give credit to Freccero's essay 'The Sign of Satan' (in ^Dante: 
The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard 
University Press, 1986], pp. 167-79).  Whether we accept their 
interpretation or not, it does seem that they, and very few others, 
have responded with the kind of attention that the passage obviously 
calls for.  And now, for a lengthy and illuminating discussion, 
analyzing the moment as a parodic moment of mystical perception, see 
Giusppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002]), pp. 
159-73.

	|30-31.~  That is, 'I am, proportionally, closer in size to a giant 
than a giant is to Lucifer.'  For the size of the giants, ca. 70 feet, 
see the note to ^Inferno~ XXX.58-66.  Let us, merely for purposes of 
calculation, agree that Dante was six feet tall.  The equation is 
simple: 6/70 = 70/x; x = 817.  Thus Lucifer is at the very minimum 817 
feet tall.  Since both the giants and Satan are only halfway out of the 
ice, that leaves him as towering, from the waist up, over the ice by at 
least 409 feet.  

	|35.~  Satan, once of the highest order of angels, the Seraphim, has 
come a long way down.  It is worth noting that the only other sinner in 
hell referred to as raising his brow is prideful Farinata (^Inf~. X.45).

	|37-38.~  The 'wonder' that is Satan even now reminds us of his divine 
origin.  As many have noted, he stands before us as a parodic version 
of Christ crucified, even to his physical resemblance to the scene on 
Golgotha, in which Christ was upon a cross between two thieves.  For a 
representation of the three-headed Satan known to Dante from the mosaic 
on the ceiling of the Baptistry in Florence see Bosco/Reggio (comm. to 
vv. 34-36).

	|39-45.~  The three colors of Satan's faces have caused much debate.  
Almost all the early commentators equate them with the opposites of the 
three attributes of the trinitarian God, Love, Power, and Knowledge.  
They associate red with anger, thus hatred (or impotence), yellowish 
white with impotence (or hatred), and black with ignorance.  As many 
note, these are not particularly convincing schemes, if their overall 
applicability seems acceptable.  John Freccero (in ^Dante: The Poetics 
of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 
1986]), pp. 170-77, attempts to develop an extended analogy between 
Dante's three-colored Satanic faces and the mulberry tree, whose fruit 
moves through time from waxen white, through red, to black, and thus 
mirrors the movement from first sin to death.  As things stand, the 
question remains an open one.

	|46-51.~  The six wings of Satan are his six wings as one of the 
angelic order of Seraphim (Isaiah 6:2); they are now not glorious in 
color but the wings of a giant bat.  Their resemblance to sails on a 
great ship are parodic, since Satan proceeds nowhere, but connect with 
images associated with Ulysses (^Inf~. XXVI) and the ship bringing the 
saved souls to the shore of purgatory (^Purg~. I).

	|53-57.~  Guido da Pisa (comm. to XXXIV.13-15) associates Satan's 
tears and mastication with a biblical text (Matthew 8:12), Jesus's 
words to the Centurion concerning those who fail to believe: 'and there 
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

	|61-67.~  The three most gravely punished sinners of the poem are 
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus (founder of the Church), as well as 
Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar (the first ruler of the 
Empire).  Judas is tortured more heavily, his back flayed ([see ^Inf~. 
XXXIV.58-60] as was Christ's, on the way to Golgotha, bearing the 
cross).  Nonetheless, Brutus and Cassius, those stalwarts of the Roman 
Republic, which Dante honored so notably (see Robert Hollander and 
Albert Rossi, "Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104 
[1986], pp. 59-82), are not treated a great deal better.  When we 
consider that another 'conspirator' against Julius, Cato the Younger, 
is found saved in the next canto (^Purg~. I), we must surely be 
puzzled.  For Dante, despite his predominant hostility to him as a man 
(see William Stull and Robert Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of 
Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991(1997)], pp. 33-43), Julius 
was nonetheless the first emperor of Rome, and thus served a 
divinely-ordained purpose.  For this reason, Brutus and Cassius are 
seen as betrayers of their rightful lord.

	|68-69.~  It is now nightfall of the Saturday of Easter weekend; the 
journey to this point has lasted precisely twenty-four hours.  We have 
also reached the border of the midpoint of this canto, verse 69 of 139. 
 The next verse begins the action that will encompass another 
twenty-four-hour period, seventy verses that will extend through 
exactly as many hours as have been consumed by the journey up to now.

	|71-75.~  When Satan opens his wings, Virgil, with Dante holding on to 
him, seizes the moment to grasp the animal-like flank of Satan.

	|76-84.~  At the very center of the universe even Virgil, a shade, 
feels the pull of gravity as he tries to move back up toward the light. 
 See Freccero's overall view of the situation: 'In this spiritual 
universe, Satan falls with his immense weight to the center and the 
pilgrim rises to the Empyrean according to the universal law of gravity 
and grace, an extraordinary amalgam of Aristotelian physics and 
Augustinian spirituality' ("Dante's Cosmos" [Bernardo Lecture Series, 
No. 6; Binghamton, N.Y.: CEMERS, 1998], p. 3).

	The locution describing Virgil's changed direction, 'ov' elli avea le 
zanche' (where he had his shanks), has caused debate, some believing 
that the 'he' refers to Virgil himself, i.e., turned his head to where 
^his~ legs had been; others, that he turned his head to where Satan's 
leg were.  Our translation follows Anna Hatcher and Mark Musa, who opt 
for Satan's legs ("Lucifer's Legs," ^Publications of the Modern 
Language Association of America~ 79 [1964], pp. 191-99, and "Lucifer's 
Legs, Again," ^Modern Language Notes~ 81 [1966], pp. 88-91), pointing 
out, among other things, that Dante's insertion of the pronoun 'elli' 
before the verb 'avea' makes it almost necessary to draw this 
conclusion, since he never else inserts a pronoun into a sequence of 
verbs without introducing a new subject of the verb; that is, if the 
line read '[Virgilio] volse la testa ov' avea le zanche,' Virgil would 
clearly be the implied subject of the second verb.  According to 
Hatcher and Musa, the 'elli' all but removes that possibility.  For the 
word ^zanche~ (shanks) see the note to ^Inferno~ XIX.45.

	Since Dante doesn't understand (see vv. 90-93) that he has reached the 
center of the universe and is being moved back upward toward the 
surface of the earth at the antipodes, he assumes that Virgil is going 
back up toward the ice of Cocytus.

	|94-96.~  It is now 7:30 am (midway between 6:00 and 9:00, the first 
'tierce,' or three-hour period, into four of which the solar day was 
divided (6-9; 9-noon; noon-3; 3-6).  Since moments ago (v. 68) we had 
learned that it was 6:00 pm in Jerusalem, how can this be?  For the 
first time in the poem Virgil tells time by the sun, and not the moon; 
and he tells it by the position of the sun in purgatory, twelve hours 
ahead of Jerusalem (where it is currently 7:30 pm).  We are leaving 
hell behind.

	|97-120.~  Even though the travelers have to traverse an enormous 
distance in seventy lines, thirty-nine of them (vv. 88-126) are devoted 
to their new situation, Dante's three questions, and Virgil's 
responses.  The setting is a space on the convex side of the ice of 
Cocytus, i.e., on its far side.  The only remaining evidence of the 
infernal core is offered by the legs of Lucifer, sticking up through 
the crust of the area that contains the rest of him.  We are on the 
other side of the ice, and there is nothing more by way of constructed 
space to catch our eye.

	Dante wants to know why he no longer sees the ice, why Lucifer is 
'upside down,' and how it can already be morning.  Some of Virgil's 
explanations have already been adverted to.  He also explains that they 
are now under the southern hemisphere of the world above, not the 
northern, where Christ was put to death and whence they had begun their 
descent.

	|121-126.~  Virgil's final words in ^Inferno~ create, as it were, the 
foundation myth of sin: how it established itself in the world that God 
had made good.  Carla Forti ("Nascit@a dell'Inferno o nascit@a 
del Purgatorio: nota sulla caduta del Lucifero dantesco," ^Rivista di 
letteratura italiana~ 4 [1986], p. 246), refers to the passage as a 
'genuine cosmological myth' and describes the fall of Lucifer as 'the 
first event that occurs in time' (p. 259).

	It is worth considering a similar passage in Ovid (^Metam~. I.151-162: 
Astraea, or justice, has just left the earth.  The battle of Phlegra 
ensues (about which we have heard in ^Inf~. XXXI.44-45, ^Inf~. 
XXXI.91-96, ^Inf~. XXXI.119-121); once the giants are destroyed, mother 
Earth, Gea, forms man in their image, if smaller, out of their gore.  
But this new stock, too, is contemptuous of the gods.  Soon enough 
Lycaon (the 'wolf-man') will commit the first murder, one that will 
eventually lead to the murder of Julius Caesar (verse 201).

	Here, in the final moments of the final canto, we learn of the first 
things to occur in terrestrial time: Satan fell from heaven and crashed 
into our earth (see ^Par~. XXIX.55-57).  To flee from him, all the land 
in the southern hemisphere hid beneath the sea and moved to the north 
of the equator, while the matter that he displaced in his fall rose up 
behind him to form the mount of purgatory.

	Over the years there have been efforts to find contradictions to this 
view of the earth's 'geology' in Dante's later ^Questio de aqua et 
terra~ (1320).  Bruno Nardi, ^La caduta di Lucifero e 
l'autenticit@a della "Quaestio de aqua et terra~" (Torino, S.E.I. 
[Lectura Dantis Romana]: 1959) [now in B. Nardi, ^"Lecturae" e altri 
studi danteschi~, ed. R. Abardo (Firenze: Le Lettere, 1990), pp. 
227-65] made a case for the contradiction.  Freccero's review ("Satan's 
Fall and the ^Quaestio de aqua et terra~," ^Italica~ 38 [1961], pp. 
99-115) offered strong rebuttals to Nardi's main arguments.  The 
magisterial edition produced by Mazzoni (Dante Alighieri, ^Opere 
minori~, vol. II [Milan-Naples: Ricciardi, 1979], pp. 691-880) 
convincingly presents the work as Dantean.  Pasquazi ("Sulla cosmogonia 
di Dante [^Inferno~ XXXIV e ^Questio de aqua et terra~]," in his 
^D'Egitto in Ierusalemme~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 1985], pp. 121-56) makes a 
strong case for the absence of any significant contradiction.  For a 
study of the wider question see Giorgio Stabile, "Cosmologia e teologia 
nella ^Commedia~: la caduta di Lucifero e il rovesciamento del mondo," 
^Letture classensi~ 12 (1983), pp. 139-73.  More recently, Zygmunt 
Baranski ("The Mystery of Dante's ^Questio de aqua et terra~," in ^In 
amicizia: Essays in Honour of Giulio Lepschy~, ed. Z.G. Baranski and L. 
Pertile [^The Italianist~ 17 (1997--special supplement)], pp. 146-64) 
also argues for authenticity.

	|127-132.~  Along a passage in the rock through the space contained 
between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the 
underside of the earth above, the travelers follow the sound of a 
stream.  It, many suggest, is the river Lethe, running down into hell 
filled with the sins now forgotten by all who have purged themselves of 
them (^Purg~. XXVIII.127-130).

	|133-138.~  There is no pausing for rest that now seems a waste of 
time, given the nearness of the light.  Looking through a crevice (the 
word in Italian is ^pertugio~, the same word used to describe the 
opening through which Ugolino could see the moon from his cell [^Inf~. 
XXXIII.22]) in the earth's surface, whence, we assume, comes the little 
stream that they are following, Dante is able to see a few stars in the 
firmament above him.

	|139.~  In a single verse the ^cantica~ concludes.  And in this line 
both Virgil and Dante actually step out of hell, and now can see the 
full expanse of the dawn sky, filled with stars.  Both ^Purgatorio~ and 
^Paradiso~ will also end with the word 'stars' (^stelle~), the goals of 
a human sight that is being drawn to God.  There is no doubt as to the 
fact that even ^Inferno~, ending in happiness of this kind, is a 
comedic part of a comedic whole.
