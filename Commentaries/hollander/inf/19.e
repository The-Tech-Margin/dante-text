	|1-6.~  For Simon Magus see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.1).  And 
for the intrinsic and striking distinction between the man named Simon, 
who was a ^magus~ (Acts 8:9), and the apostle Peter, also named Simon 
(^Simon Petrus~ -- John 20:2, 20:6), see Singleton, "^Inferno~ XIX: O 
Simon Mago!" ^Modern Language Notes~ 80 (1965), pp. 92-99, as well as 
Ronald Herzman and William Stephany, "'O miseri seguaci': Sacramental 
Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 (1978), pp. 40, 46.  
Nicholas is seen as the follower of Simon Magus, while Dante presents 
himself as the follower of Simon Peter.

	For studies of the canto as a whole see Kenelm Foster, "The Canto of 
the Damned Popes: ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 87 (1969), pp. 47-68, 
and the third chapter of Mark Musa, ^Advent at the Gates~ (Bloomington, 
IN: Indiana University Press, 1974).

	|16-21.~  Some have argued that this passage is not credible if taken 
literally and, therefore, must be understood as metaphorical.  See Leo 
Spitzer ("Two Dante Notes: I. An Autobiographical Incident in ^Inferno~ 
XIX; II. Libicocco," ^Romanic Review~ 34 [1943], pp. 248-62) and, more 
recently, Susan Noakes ("Dino Compagni and the Vow in San Giovanni: 
^Inferno~ XIX, 16-21," ^Dante Studies~ 86 [1968], pp. 41-63), who 
argues that the public vow of adherence to the French king taken, in 
the Baptistry and thus in proximity to the font, before Charles of 
Valois entered Florence in 1302, is what Dante now confesses he 
'broke.'  The language of the passage is so concrete that it seems 
difficult to credit such an ingenious solution.

	Mazzoni ("Dante's ^battezzatori~ [^Inf~. XIX, 16-21," English outline 
of an unpublished talk presented to the Dante Society of America on the 
occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Society, 
Istituto Culturale Italiano, New York, 24 June1981]) affirms the 
literal meaning of the passage, while leaving in doubt the nature of 
the act that Dante claims to have performed.  Reviewing the commentary 
tradition, he supports the view of most of the early commentators that 
the noun ^battezzatori~ refers to the priests who performed baptismal 
rites.  Mirko Tavoni ("Effrazione battesimale tra i simoniaci [^Inf~. 
XIX 13-21]," ^Rivista di letteratura italiana~ 10 (1992], pp. 457-512) 
gives reasons for believing that it refers to the fonts themselves.  
That question is probably not resolvable, as the noun can have either 
meaning.

	All the early commentators take the incident referred to here as 
actually having occurred, when a child, playing with other children, 
became lodged in one of the smaller baptismal fonts of the Forentine 
baptistry.  Castelvetro (comm. to XIX.13-20) has perhaps the most 
believable explanation (even if he criticizes the author for including 
this detail, which, according to him, adds nothing to the poem): in his 
view the baptismal font and its several little ^pozzetti~ were 
protected by a thin wooden covering in order to protect the holy water 
from sight (and desacralizing droppings?).  It is ^this~ and not the 
marble of the font (which Benvenuto da Imola has Dante breaking with an 
axe brought to him by a bystander [comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.19-21]) that the 
poet broke, thus saving the near-drowned child.  His solemn oath, 
reminiscent of the language describing papal bulls and their seals (see 
^Par~. XI.93, where Pope Innocent gave his approval to the founding of 
St. Francis's order, 'primo sigillo a sua relig,ione' [the first 
seal of his order]), now stakes his authority as Florentine and poet on 
the charitable nature of his act, which others had apparently 
characterized as sacreligious.  Whatever explanation we find most 
acceptable, it seems clear that Dante is referring to an actual event 
that his former fellow-citizens would remember.

	|22-24.~  We shall later learn that Dante here comes face to feet with 
a pope, Nicholas III (^Inf~. XIX.69-72).  The inverted figure, like 
Judas in the central mouth of Lucifer (^Inf~. XXXIV.63), has his head 
within, his legs without.  Dante's use of ^bocca~ (mouth) for the 
opening of the hole into which he descends suggests that eventually 
Nicholas will be eaten and digested by hell itself once the next 
simoniac pope comes to his eternal station.  For both these 
interpretations see Herzman and Stephany ("'O miseri seguaci': 
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]), 
pp. 59, 65.

	|25.~  For the parodic inversion of Pentecostal fire in the punishment 
of sins that involve the perversion of the gift of the Holy Spirit, in 
particular as manifest in the misuse of extraordinary gifts of 
persuasion found among those punished as heresiarchs, sodomites, 
simoniacs, and false counsellors, see Reginald French ("Simony and 
Pentecost," ^Annual Report of the Dante Society~ 82 [1964]), pp. 8-10.  
A similar observation, if one limited to this scene, was made sixty 
years earlier by Carroll (comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.22-30).

	|28-30.~  This sole 'classical' simile in a canto that favors the 
rhetorical device of authorial apostrophe (^Inf~. XIX.1, ^Inf~. XIX.10, 
^Inf~. XIX.115) is muted in comparison with Dante's generally more 
developed similes of this type.  For the oil referred to here as 
indicative, parodically, of the anointing unction that priests offer 
those who suffer, see Herzman and Stephany ("'O miseri seguaci': 
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]), 
pp. 49-51.  Unction is usually associated with the head, not the feet; 
the ironic point is clear.

	|35.~  The further bank of the ^bolgia~ is not as high as the nearer 
one because the slope of the Malebolge cuts away the topmost part of 
each successive pouch.  For this reason Virgil will lead Dante over the 
third ^bolgia~ to the fourth embankment only to climb down into the 
third from this vantage point.

	|37-39.~  Dante's submissiveness to his lord, acknowledging Virgil's 
awareness of his wishes, is surely meant to contrast with Nicholas's 
rebellious offense to his.

	|45.~  For the intriguing concept that the word ^zanca~ actually 
refers not to 'shanks' themselves but to their coverings, Roman 
military 'boots' that enclosed the calf and top of the foot, see Ernest 
Kaulbach, "^Inferno~ XIX, 45: The 'Zanca' of Temporal Power," ^Dante 
Studies~ 86 (1968), pp. 127-35.  He argues that, since in the late 
thirteenth century no one in Rome but the Prefect of the city was 
allowed to wear ^zanche~ within the confines of the city (thus 
reflecting their significance for temporal, and not spiritual, 
authority), the fact that Dante's pope wears them is indicative 
precisely of papal assertion of temporal power.  The pope is thus 
punished for this sin along with simony.  Kaulbach's argument is 
strengthened by the reference to the Donation of Constantine in this 
canto (see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.115-117).  It is, however, weakened 
by the fact that Satan's legs (or Virgil's -- the point is debated) are 
also referred to as ^zanche~ (^Inf~. XXXIV.79 and the note to ^Inf~. 
XXXIV.79).

	|46-47.~  The pope's situation is reminiscent of St. Peter's 
upside-down crucifixion (see Herzman and Stephany, "'O miseri seguaci': 
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], p. 
44), but also refers to the Florentine mode of dispatching convicted 
assassins, 'planting' them upside down in a hole and then suffocating 
them when the hole is filled back up with earth: 'Let the assassin be 
planted upside down, so that he may be put to death.'  Perhaps the 
earliest commentator to make reference to this 'ancient decree' of 
Florence is Rossetti (comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.46-51).

	|48.~  Musa (^Advent at the Gates~ [Bloomington, IN: Indiana 
University Press, 1974], p. 46), draws the reader's attention to 
popularizing phrases that exist only in the negative, e.g., the English 
'he didn't say beans,' paralleled in the Italian phrase 'e non fa 
motto' (he doesn't say a word), used of Brutus in ^Inf~. XXXIV.66).   
Musa's point is that Dante here uses a phrase that we expect to hear 
only in the negative to telling sarcastic effect: this is a strikingly 
insulting way to address a pope.

	|49-51.~  Dante now assumes the role of confessing friar.  The last 
verse of the tercet has caused controversy.  Most of the early 
commentators think the verb ^cessare~ is used intransitively; most 
later ones disagree, believing it is used transitively (as it is at 
^Inf~. XVII.33).  But almost all agree on the basic meaning: the 
assassin calls back the friar in order to delay his death a while.  
Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~ 
[Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967], pp. 263-69, opts for a strikingly 
different solution, one that has had some success among recent 
commentators.  Since ^cessare~, used transitively, ordinarily in Dante 
means 'to avoid,' it does so here as well.  The assassin calls the 
priest back in order to confess, not his own crimes, but those of his 
master in crime, thereby gaining his freedom.  The solution is 
attractive because it avoids the somewhat unusual use of 'cessare' to 
mean 'put off, delay' instead of 'avoid, escape from.'  However, the 
context, in which nothing the sinner can say will sway either Dante or 
God, works against it.  Further, had Dante wanted to make the analogy 
work, he would have had Nicholas 'betray' someone else, one who had led 
him into his crimes.  Instead, he admits his own addiction to simony, 
and then points to others who will practice it ^after~ him.  If these 
nine verses (79-87) are, as many believe, a later addition (see the 
note to ^Inf~. XIX.79-87), it is conceivable that Dante's first version 
of Nicholas's speech might have concluded with just such a betrayal.  
In that case, many who remain unconvinced might embrace Pagliaro's 
thesis.  In our translation we have tried to hedge, using 'stay' in 
such a way as to allow it to be interpreted either as 'put off (for a 
while)' or 'put a stop to.'

	For a new hypothesis, one put forward in the attempt to break through 
to a new solution, see Luca Serianni ("Un paragone dantesco: ^Inferno~, 
XIX, 49-51," in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, ed. Pier Vincenzo 
Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993], pp. 473-76), arguing for 
the view that the assassin calls back the friar in order to save, not 
his earthly life, but his soul.  Since this is what those damned in 
hell may be understood not to have done at their last moment, it seems 
less than a convincing explanation.

	|52-53.~  The first naming of Pope Boniface VIII (Benedetto Caetani) 
in the poem.  Succeeding Celestine V in January of 1295 and dying in 
October of 1303, he greatly strengthened the power of the papacy, while 
also asserting its temporal power in the realm Dante allowed to Empire 
alone.  His support of the Black Guelphs and the French forces in 
Florence earned him Dante's unflagging enmity.  Nicholas's taking Dante 
for Boniface is grimly yet hilariously amusing.  His doubled phrasing 
will be echoed in Virgil's instructions to Dante a few lines later 
(^Inf~. XIX.61-62).

	|54.~  Some have suggested that the condition of future knowledge 
alluded to by Farinata (^Inf~. X.100-108) pertains only to the 
heretics; this passage would seem to indicate clearly that others, as 
well, and perhaps all those in hell, have some sense of the future but 
none of the present.  Nicholas had 'read' in the 'book of the future' 
that Boniface would be on his way to hell as of 1303, and is thus now 
confused, as he expects no one else to pile in on top of him but 
Boniface.

	|57.~  The beautiful Lady is, resolved from metaphor, the Church, 
Christ's 'bride.'

	|69-72.~  Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini) served from 
1277-1280, openly practicing nepotism in favor of his relations.  His 
references to the 'she-bear' and her 'cubs' reflect his family name, 
Orsini (^orsa~ means 'bear' in Italian), one of the most powerful of 
Roman families.

	|79-87.~  Clement is compared to Jason, brother of the high priest 
Onias.  From the king of Syria, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, he bought his 
brother's position and then brought pagan practices to Jerusalem (see 
II Maccabees 4:7-26).  In short, to Dante he seemed a Jewish 'simoniac 
pope,' prefiguring the corrupt practices of Clement.  Dante condemns, 
as Durling points out (^The "Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes 
by R. M. Durling and Ronald Martinez [New York and Oxford: Oxford 
University Press, 1996], p. 300), a number of Clement's actions, 
including 'his role in Philip's destruction of the Templars (^Purg~ 
XX.91-93); the removal of the papal see to Avignon (^Purg~ 
XXXII.157-160); his simony (^Par~. XVII.82); and his betrayal of Henry 
VII (^Par~. XXX.142-148).'

	This is perhaps the crucial passage for those who debate the internal 
dating of the composition of the poem.  First, one should explain its 
literal meaning.  Nicholas has now been 'cooking' for twenty years 
(1280-1300).  The Frenchman Bertrand de Got, who served as Pope Clement 
V from 1305-1314 and who supervised the papacy's removal to Avignon, an 
act that caused much Italian outrage (and notably Dante's [see ^Purg~ 
XXXII.157-160; ^Epistle~ XI.21-26]), will replace Boniface as topmost 
simoniac pope before Boniface spends twenty years in that position of 
punishment, i.e., before 1323.  If the first ^cantica~ was composed, as 
many, but not all, propose, between 1306-07 and 1309-10, Dante here is 
either making a rough (and chancey) prediction that Clement, who 
suffered from ill health, would die sometime before 1323, or he is 
knowingly referring to the death of Clement in 1314.  However, most, 
observing Dante's general practice in 'predicting' only things actually 
known to him, argue that this is a prophecy ^post eventum~, i.e., that 
the passage was written after April of 1314, when Clement died.  If 
that is true, then either the traditional dating of the poem's 
composition is incorrect, and it was written later (and much more 
quickly) than is generally believed (ca. 1313-1321), or Dante inserted 
this passage while he was revising ^Inferno~ in 1315 before circulating 
it.  This is Petrocchi's solution (^Itinerari danteschi~ [Milan: Franco 
Angeli, 1994+2~ (Bari: Laterza, 1969)]) and many follow it.  For an 
opposing view, see Padoan (^Il lungo cammino del "Poema sacro": studi 
danteschi~ [Florence: Olschki, 1993]).  And for a summary of the 
question and bibliography see A. E. Quaglio, 'Commedia, Composizione' 
(ED.1970.2), pp. 81-82.

	That this is the only reference to Clement before well into 
^Purgatorio~ lends support to the idea that this passage is a later 
interpolation.  In a paper written in 1999 Stefano Giannini, a graduate 
student at Johns Hopkins University, examined all the references to 
events occurring after 1300 in ^Inferno~ ("Post-1300 Time-References in 
Dante's ^Inferno~," unpublished paper prepared at Johns Hopkins 7 June 
1999).  His provisional results are as follows: 22 references to events 
occurring between 1300 and 1304; 4 references to events occurring 
between 1306 and 1309 (all between Cantos XXVI and XXIX); this sole 
reference to an event occurring in 1314.  These results would certainly 
seem to support those who maintain that this passage is a later 
interpolation and that ^Inferno~ was essentially completed during the 
first decade of the fourteenth century.  For a different point of view, 
see Michelangelo Picone ("Avignone come tema letterario: Dante e 
Petrarca," ^L'Alighieri~ 20 [2002]), pp. 7-8; he argues that the 
prophetic gesture here (unlike that in ^Inf~. XXXII.148-153, which 
clearly refers to the 'Avignonian captivity'), offers no sense of the 
removal of the papacy to Avignon, and thus represents a moment of 
genuine prophecy on Dante's part, since it therefore must have 
been written before 1309.  This interesting point may be countered by 
the argument that, revising his text after 1314, Dante did not need to 
refer to the infamous transfer of the papal seat, familiar to all in 
Europe.  Furthermore, his phrase describing Clement's outdoing of 
even Boniface in evil, as one 'di pi@u laida opra' (one even fouler 
in his deeds--verse 82) certainly may have been intended to refer to 
nothing more than or other than Clement's worst deed of all, the 
'abduction' of the papacy to France.

	|88-89.~  Dante's coyness here is palpable: of course he is not being 
'too bold' (^troppo folle~) in the eyes of any just observer.  At the 
same time he is clearly aware of the enormity of his 'singing' such a 
'tune' to a pope.  Some attempt to forge a relationship here between 
Dante and Ulysses.  E.g., Barolini, who refers to the adjective ^folle~ 
as a 'Ulyssean word' (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992], p. 79); Durling (^The 
"Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes by R. M. Durling and Ronald 
Martinez [New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996], p. 300), 
who claims that this adjective is used elsewhere in the poem only to 
refer to 'the possible rashness of the voyage of the pilgrim and the 
journey of Ulysses.'  The adjective ^folle~ is used fourteen times in 
all in the ^Comedy~, three times to refer to Dante, twice to Ulysses, 
and nine times to the rashness of others, as a search on 'foll?' in the 
DDP will quickly demonstrate.

	|90-117.~  Dante's great outburst of invective against Nicholas (and 
all simoniac popes) is based on the history of the Church, beginning 
with Christ's calling of Peter, moving to Peter's and the other 
apostles' choosing Matthias by lot to take the place of Judas.  After 
Dante alludes to Nicholas's vile maneuvering against the Angevin king, 
Charles I of Sicily, he returns to the Bible, now to Revelation (for 
discussion see V. Stanley Benfell, "Prophetic Madness: The Bible in 
^Inferno~ XIX," ^Modern Language Notes~ 110 [1995], pp. 145-63), 
interpreted positively as the presentation of the Roman Church as 
keeper of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Ten Commandments.  
(For the relationship between the woman here [Rome as honest wife of 
the Caesars, free of papal constraint] and the whore of ^Purgatorio~ 
XXXII [Rome as the corrupted Church after the Donation of Constantine] 
see Charles Davis ["Canto XIX: Simoniacs," in ^Lectura Dantis: 
"Inferno"~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A. Oldcorn, C. Ross (Berkeley: 
University of California Press, 1998)], p. 271.)  Dante's oration ends 
with a final slam at papal worship of 'the golden calf,' joining the 
final apostrophe of the canto, addressed to Constantine as the source 
of most of Christianity's troubles when he granted the papacy temporal 
authority.

	|115-117.~  The author's apostrophe of the emperor Constantine
(reigned 306-337) holds him responsible for the so-called 'Donation
of Constantine,' by which he granted temporal sovereignty to Pope
Sylvester I (314-335) -- and his successors -- over Italy and the rest
of the western empire.	This document was considered genuine until
Lorenzo Valla, in the fifteenth century, demonstrated that it was a
forgery.  For Dante it was genuine and a cause for excited concern.
(His views on the subject are exposited forcefully in the later
^Monarchia~ [III.x.1-9]).  In his view the emperor was not empowered
to give over his authority; thus the document was truthful, but its
legitimacy compromised.  (This view is widely shared.  However, it is
apparently untrue.  My friend and colleague, John Scott, in an e-mail
of 21 October 2011, set things straight, citing Giovanni Maria Vian, ^La
donazione di Costantino~ [Bologna: il Mulino, 2004]: "La prima denuncia
del falso [venne] nel 1001 dalla cancelleria pontificia, quando tra
l'imperatore e il papa -- il giovanissimo Ottone III e il suo dotto
maestro Silvestro II entrambi non italiani -- regna un'ideale armonia
[...]" [p. 8]. Previously on that page we are informed that "Nei primi
decenni del Quattrocento l'opinione che il ^Constitutum Constantini~ non
fosse autentico era piuttosto diffusa, ma a dimostrare che si trattava
di un falso fu per primo l'umanista tedesco Niccol@o da Cusa ...].")

	We are perhaps meant to understand by these lines that Sylvester, who 
cured Constantine of leprosy and was, as a result, rewarded by him with 
authority over the Roman empire, is the bottom-most pope in this hole, 
the 'first rich Father,' a condition that was to his immediate benefit 
but to the eventual loss of all Christians.

	|118-123.~  These two tercets are dedicated to Dante's audiences' very 
different reaction to his outburst, Nicholas's displeasure at these 
words (the ^note~ [notes] of v. 118 recall the same word used at 
^Inferno~ XVI.126-127: 'le note / di questa comed@ia' [the strains 
of this Comedy]) and Virgil's contentment with his pupil.

	|124-126.~  Virgil's pleasure in Dante is indeed so great that he 
embraces him and carries him back out of the ^bolgia~.

	|128-130.~  Virgil sets Dante down upon the bridge that overlooks the 
fourth ^bolgia~, in which, in the next canto, Dante will observe the 
diviners.
