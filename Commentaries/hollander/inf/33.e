	|1-3.~  The complications of political intrigue lie behind the story 
that we are about to hear.  For a review, in English, see Singleton 
(comm. to XXXIII.17-18).  The main particulars are as follows.  Count 
Ugolino della Gherardesca (^ca~. 1220-1289) was of a Ghibelline family 
of Pisa.  In 1275 he joined with the Guelph Visconti family in order to 
advance his own political ambitions, but failed to do so when his plans 
became known and he was banished.  He returned to Pisa and now joined 
with the Archbishop, Ruggieri degli Ubaldini (nephew of Ottaviano 
degli Ubaldini [Inf. X.120]), a Ghibelline, and conspired with him 
against Judge Nino Visconti, a Guelph, and, in Dante's eyes, a good man 
(we see him, on his way to salvation, in ^Purg~. VIII.53).  In 1288 
Ugolino and Ruggieri managed to force Nino to leave the city, thus 
allowing them a free hand.  At this point, however, Ruggieri decided to 
be rid of Ugolino, and had him accused of 'betraying' Pisa by giving 
some of its outlying castles to the Florentines and the Lucchesi (he 
had in fact been trying to negotiate a political advantage to Pisa in 
these dealings).  With that as an excuse, Ruggieri had Ugolino 
imprisoned in the summer of 1288, along with two sons and two grandsons 
(Dante has made the tale more pathetic by making all four of the 
children young -- but Ugolino was in his sixties when the five of them 
were imprisoned).  They were starved to death in February 1289.

	Ugolino is found in Antenora, and thus was a betrayer of party or 
country.  In what did his sin consist?  Dante refers to the 'betrayal' 
involving the castles in v. 86, but seems to think this was only an 
accusation.  However, his real treacherous behavior, in Dante's eyes, 
may have involved either his betrayal of his own Ghibelline party, or 
of the good forces in Pisa itself in his double-dealing with Judge 
Nino, who also happened to be his grandson.

	Almost all admire the horror of this scene, Ugolino lifting his 
gore-stained mouth from Ruggieri's neck, then wiping it on the hair of 
his enemy's head.  We may reflect that Ugolino is moved to cease his 
vengeful chewing by his hope for further, greater vengeance: Dante's 
recounting of his case against Ruggieri in the world above.

	|4-6.~  Ugolino's first words are nearly universally observed to be a 
citation of the opening of Aeneas's sad speech to Dido in ^Aeneid~ 
II.3-8, a passage also nearly universally cited for the beginning of 
Francesca's second speech to Dante (^Inf~. V.121-123).  Why the 
repetition?  Hollander ("A Note on ^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74: Ugolino's 
Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 [1964]), p. 550, suggests that it 
represents a sort of test for the reader, who now hears another 
'sympathetic sinner' trying to capture the good will of the protagonist 
(and, indeed, of the reader) and is supposed to realize that this 
refrain has been heard before, similarly put to the service of 
exculpating a sinner by that very sinner.

	For a second Virgilian resonance here see ^Aeneid~ I.209, where Aeneas 
hides the grief in his heart from his companions ('premit altum corde 
dolorem'); the echo of these words ('che 'l ^cor~ mi ^preme~') was 
noted by Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) who observes the differing 
contexts.

	|8.~  The phrasing of Ugolino's hoped for fruition of infamy for 
Ruggieri possibly reflects the language of the parable of the sower 
(Luke 8:4-11), where Jesus interprets the seed as the word of God.  In 
their commentary, Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford 
University Press, 1996), p. 531, suggest the importance, for the images 
of fruition used both by Ugolino and Alberigo, of Matthew 7:20, 'by 
their fruits you shall know them.'  Theodore Faunce (Princeton '73) 
many years ago suggested another biblical passage that comments 
adversely upon Ugolino's hope: 'For the fruit of the spirit is in all 
goodness and righteouness and truth' (Ephesians 5:9).

	|9.~  Both Francesca (^Inf~. V.126) and Ugolino weep and speak 
simultaneously, each of them in imitation of Aeneas's imagined hardened 
soldier, who would have to speak through tears if he had the fall of 
Troy to narrate (^Aen~. II.6-8).  And both Francesca and Ugolino are 
accompanied by a companion who does not speak in Dante's presence.

	|11-12.~  Like Farinata (^Inf~. X.25), Ugolino recognizes Dante from 
his Florentine accent.

	|20-21.~  The story of Ugolino's imprisonment and death was familiar 
to all who lived in Tuscany.  What Dante could not have known, Ugolino 
says, was how much he had suffered.  The way in which he says this, on 
the other hand, indicates the sort of egotism that we will experience 
all through his speech.  Here is a man who has experienced death in the 
company of his children; we do not even hear of them at first, since 
his attention is fixed entirely on himself.  See Hollander, "A Note on 
^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74: Ugolino's Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 (1964), 
p. 551.

	|22-24.~  The tower (the edifice remains, without its tower, in the 
Piazza dei Cavallieri in Pisa to this day) would not serve as prison 
many years into the fourteenth century, but it apparently still did so 
when Dante wrote these lines.

	|26-27.~  For the supposed greater truth of morning dreams see note to 
the note to ^Inferno~ XXVI.7.

	|28-36.~  Ugolino's dream turns out to have been completely accurate: 
Ruggieri, out hunting on Mount San Giuliano, is after Ugolino (the 
wolf) and his children (the cubs).  He has set, ahead of the chase, the 
waiting ambushers, the Ghibelline leaders of Pisa, and with his hounds 
he is driving his victims toward them and to their destruction.

	For the canine imagery in Cocytus and especially in this canto, see 
Giorgio Brugnoli, "Le 'cagne conte,'" in ^Filologia e critica dantesca: 
studi offerti a Aldo Vallone~ (Florence: Olschki, 1989), pp. 95-112.

	|37-39.~  Ugolino awakes from the dream to find its reality before his 
eyes, his children hungry in their sleep and crying for their daily 
bread, usually brought them in the morning (see vv. 43-44).

	|40-42.~  Ugolino is angered by the fact that Dante is not weeping.  
The protagonist, unlike most readers, has evidently found a moral 
vantage point from which there seems something wrong with this 
narration.  Since we have seen him weep for other apparently less 
sympathetic figures, his lack of compassion might serve as a clue to us 
about our own reactions.

	In this canto, vv. 5-75, words for weeping and grief (^piangere~, 
^lagrimare~, ^doglia~, ^dolere~, ^dolore~, and ^doloroso~) occur a 
total of thirteen times (see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's 
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 306).  
And see Vittorio Russo, "Il 'dolore' del conte Ugolino," ^Sussidi di 
esegesi dantesca~ (Napoli: Liguori, 1966), pp. 147-81, for a wider 
study of this phenomenon.

	|45.~  Apparently the children have had a dream similar to their 
father's.  The process of the starvation of Ugolino and his children 
roughly coincided with the Lenten season.

	|46-48.~  Ugolino's dream now has a finer point.  He understands at 
once that they are to die, caught by the hunter Ruggieri and his men.  
His first impulse, which will be repeated, is to keep silent.

	|49.~  Ugolino, who has just criticized Dante for being cruel because 
he does not weep, now tells the protagonist that he himself did not 
weep when he perceived the fate of his sons and of himself.  Indeed, he 
turned to stone.  For Hollander ("A Note on ^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74: 
Ugolino's Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 [1964]), pp. 552-55, the key 
passage that stands behind this scene is found in Luke 11:5-13, 
Christ's parable of the importunate friend.  A man is visited by a 
friend at midnight and goes to the house of another friend to seek 
bread in order to feed his guest.  The importuned friend replies, 
'Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in 
bed; I cannot rise and give you.'  Christ comments on the parable, 
insisting that importuning will eventually work: 'If a son shall ask 
for bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?'  
The various details of the parable, in a form that is both parallel and 
antithetic to the action recounted here, find their place in Ugolino's 
narrative: the knocking on the door echoed in the hammer blows nailing 
up the prison, the man in bed with his children behind a locked door, 
and the father who will not give his son a stone when he asks for 
bread.  Ugolino, however, gives his sons exactly that, a stony silence. 
 When we ask ourselves what we would do in that situation, we probably 
know.  We would speak, not be silent (see Steven Botterill, "Rereading 
Lancelot: Dante, Chaucer, and ^Le Chevalier de la Charrette~," 
^Philological Quarterly~ 67 [1988], p. 287); we would weep with our 
children, not show Stoic reserve; and, if we were thirteenth-century 
Italians, we would pray with them after having sought their forgiveness 
for having involved them, innocent, in our political machinations.  The 
opening passage of Luke 11 has a prayer for us, should we require one, 
for it is in that text that Jesus teaches his disciples what we know as 
'the Lord's prayer.'

	That Ugolino himself was involved in the pitiless slaying of the son 
of 'the good Marzucco' (^Purg~. VI.18) is attested by various early 
commentators, e.g., Benvenuto, saying that his source was Giovanni 
Boccaccio (Benvenuto's comm. to ^Purg~. VI.16-18), the Anonimo 
Fiorentino (comm. to ^Purg~. VI.16-18), and John of Serravalle (comm to 
^Purg~. VI.16-18).  Whether the execution (by decapitation) was carried 
out under Ugolino's direct orders or not, it occurred in 1287 when 
Ugolino had returned to Pisa as its co-ruler (with Ruggieri), and 
necessarily would have indicated, in Dante's thoughts, Ugolino's 
complicity.  If Dante wrote this scene with that belief in mind, it 
helps to explain his ironic treatment of Ugolino's appeal for pity.

	|58-63.~  Ugolino, silent, biting his hands from grief, causes the 
children to think that he is hungry and they offer themselves to him 
for food.  They, like their father, can only think literally about 
nourishment, forgetting the symbolic eucharistic value of bread.  
Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff 
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986]), pp. 156-57, believes that 
their offer ^is~ eucharistic and spiritually motivated.  This is the 
last conversation among them.

	|64-69.~  The father, thinking that display of his own sorrow will 
only increase the pain felt by his sons, teaches them his lesson: stoic 
silence in the face of death.  Had Seneca written this canto, perhaps 
we would be justified in thinking Ugolino's reserve a valuable example 
of courage.  The silence is only broken once more, on this fourth day, 
by Gaddo, dying, who asks the question the reader, too, might very well 
ask: 'O father, why won't you help me?'  The drama of paternity that we 
find in this canto is not that proposed, in his beautiful essay, by 
Francesco De Sanctis ("L'Ugolino di Dante," in his ^Opere~, vol. 5 
[Turin: Einaudi, 1967 (1869)], pp. 681-704), but that of a terribly 
failing father.

	The total absence of religious concerns in Dante's portrait of Ugolino 
is in contrast to the tale that circulates in some of the commentaries, 
first in 1333 in the Ottimo (comm. to  XXXIII.1-9), that Ugolino, 
realizing they were all to die, asked for a friar to confess them, and 
was refused.  Had Dante included such a detail, his Ugolino would have 
seemed a much different man.

	|74.~  Only now that it is too late does Ugolino break the silence 
with his cries.  It is the last heart-breaking detail of his failure as 
a father.  The tale that he tells to win Dante's sympathy has also 
failed, as we shall see.

	|75.~  Did Ugolino ingest his children?  For a history of the 
centuries-long debate see Hollander ("Ugolino's Supposed Cannibalism: A 
Bibliographical Note and Discussion," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 6 
[1985], pp. 64-81).  For a strong argument in favor of the notion, see 
Ronald Herzman ("Cannibalism and Communion in ^Inferno~ XXXIII," ^Dante 
Studies~ 98 [1980], pp. 53-78).  To most, the position represented by 
Herzman and others, mainly (in recent years) Americans, seems a not 
convincing interpretation.  In Singleton's view, it is a 'curious 
view,' one 'hardly worth a serious rebuttal' (comm. to XXXIII.75).  
This writer stands with Geoffrey Chaucer's view of the matter in the 
^Monk's Tale~, v. 2455: 'Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf' (and 
he, despairing, also [i.e., as the children had] died from hunger).  
One wishes that Chaucer had used a term for starvation, but that might 
not have rhymed or scanned.  'Digiuno' (fasting) is not the same thing 
as 'hunger.'  And surely Chaucer knew that.

	An observation in the commentary of Guido da Pisa also offers evidence 
that the number of days in the narrative (seven) is significant in this 
regard.  Guido says, 'And lest it seem impossible that one could have 
lived six days without food, heed Macrobius on the ^Dream of Scipio~.  
He says that the life of a man cannot last beyond seven days without 
food' (comm. to XXXIII.37-45).  Pietro di Dante thinks of a biblical 
passage that also involves a seven-day fast.  David fasted for seven 
days when his son by Bathsheba was stricken, and then was convinced by 
the priests to resume eating, lest he perish, upon the death of the 
child (II Samuel 12:15-23).  If Dante, with his so carefully calculated 
seven days to starvation, is aware of this bit of medical lore, Ugolino 
died at the limit of human endurance without nourishment.  Had he 
ingested the flesh of his children, he would have lived longer.  
Further, when the corpses were exhibited outside the tower, after their 
removal, the scandal of the teeth-torn flesh would have made the 
rounds.  No such story did, with the exception of a variant, somewhat 
suspect, in text of the commentary of Jacopo della Lana.  See 
Hollander, "Ugolino's Supposed Cannibalism: A Bibliographical Note and 
Discussion," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 6 (1985), n. 24.  For still 
another review of the question and a return to the cannibalistic 
reading see Fabrizio Franceschini, "Un'interpretazione strutturale di 
^Inf~. XXXIII 75 nel primo Ottocento (Giovanni Carmignani, 1826)," 
^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~, 1 (2001), pp. 128-46.

	For another possible source of Ugolino's narrative and, in particular, 
its final verse, see Andreas Heil ("Ugolino und Andromache: Ein 
Senecazitat bei Dante?" ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 75 [2000], pp. 
57-65), arguing for a series of references to elements in the scene 
between Andromache and Ulysses, in Seneca's tragedy ^Troades~, 
especially Ulysses' speech, lines 578-587, concerning Andromache's 
grief-filled concern for her (and Hector's) son Astyanax.  Line 581, 
'necessitas plus posse quam pietas solet' (necessity tends to have more 
power than filial love), surely sounds close to Dante's 'Poscia, 
pi@u che 'l dolor, pot$e 'l digiuno' (Then fasting had more power 
than grief).  Heil is aware of the problem that we have no sure 
knowledge of Dante's reading in the tragedies of Seneca.  He admits 
that he may have known passages from Seneca from various ^florilegia~, 
but also suggests that the closeness to Seneca's words in this scene 
may point to a first-hand knowledge of the ^Troades~.

	|76-78.~  His tale told, Ugolino resumes his bestial rage against the 
cause of his woes, the skull of Ruggieri, whose evil plots bested 
Ugolino's own machinations.  For the view that Ugolino hides his own 
culpability behind that of others, see Giorgio Barberi Squarotti, 
"L'orazione del conte Ugolino," in ^L'artificio dell'eternit@a~  
(Verona: Fiorini, 1972), pp. 283-332.

	|79-90.~  Romantic readers, who admire Ugolino, do not often read past 
verse 75 with close attention.  Dante's apostrophe of Pisa, 'new 
Thebes,' blames the city, not for killing Ugolino, which it had a 
reason to do (if not perhaps a correct one), but for killing the 
children.  All of Dante's sympathy is lodged with the children, none 
with Ugolino.  And here we are not speaking of the protagonist (who was 
firm enough himself against Ugolino's entreaties for pity), but of the 
author.

	In ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.viii.2-5 Dante had divided Europeans into 
three large linguistic groups, Proven$cal, French, and Italian, by 
their respective ways of saying 'yes,' ^oc~, ^o,il~, and ^s@i~. 
 He thus, at vv. 79-80, refers to the inhabitants of Italy.

	Capraia and Gorgona are islands in the Mediterranean that then 
belonged to Pisa.

	|91-93.~  The transition to Ptolomea is as abrupt as that to Antenora 
had been (^Inf~. XXXII.70).  And once again the determining detail is 
the positioning of the faces of those punished in the area.  These now 
have their faces turned upwards (where those in Antenora looked 
straight ahead and those in Ca,ina had their faces tilted downward).

	Most commentators believe that Ptolomea, where treachery to guests and 
friends is punished, gets its name from Ptolemy, the captain of Jericho 
who, as recorded in (I Maccabees 16:11-17), invited his father-in-law, 
Simon Maccabeus, and his two sons to a banquet and then, once they had 
drunk, slew them.  (There is dispute about the matter, some proposing 
Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt, 51-47 B.C., who murdered Pompey as a favor 
to Julius Caesar [^Phars~. VIII.536-712].)

	|94-99.~  Their upturned visages turn the eye-sockets into cups in 
which the tears of the sinners become small basins of ice.  Fra 
Alberigo will three times ask Dante to clear these for him (^Inf~. 
XXXIII.112-114, 127-128, 148-150).

	|100-105.~  Despite his frozen facial skin, Dante feels a wind, and 
asks Virgil how this can be, since the sun, creator of wind, is absent 
from this place.

	|106-108.~  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, xomm. to vv. 100-108) suggests 
that the wind spirating from Satan, to which Virgil alludes gingerly, 
not wanting to alarm Dante unduly (compare his behavior as they 
approached the giants in ^Inf~. XXXI.29-33), is a perverse imitation of 
the breath of the Holy Spirit referred to in Acts 2:3.

	|109-114.~  The only speaking presence in Ptolomea (identified as Fra 
Alberigo in verse 118) believes that Dante and Virgil are sinners 
destined for Judecca, the 'lowest station' in Inferno.  In Antenora the 
souls seemed to be able to tell that Dante was alive; here, perhaps 
because of their greater physical discomfort and ice-bound blindness, 
their sensory capacities seem more limited than those of the souls 
above them.

	|115-117.~  Dante's 'agreement' with Alberigo is utterly cynical; he 
has no intention of helping this sinner in any way, and says what he 
says only to get the sinner to disclose himself, swearing a misleading 
oath in order to reassure him (of course he is going to the 'bottom of 
the ice,' but not as a sinner for his eternal punishment, but as a very 
privileged visitor).

	|118-120.~  A member of the Jovial Friars (see the note to ^Inf~. 
XXIII.103), Alberigo was was a Guelph from Faenza, and, in 1285, 
invited two of his relatives, with one of whom he had had a dispute, to 
dinner.  When he called out for the fruit course, the pre-arranged 
signal, hired assassins rushed into the room and killed his guests.  
Now, he says, he is having a fruit course of his own, in which he is 
getting more (and worse) than he gave, date for fig (since, in Dante's 
day, dates were more expensive than figs).

	|122-133.~  Here, in answer to the protagonist's question, based in 
his surprise at finding him here, since he had not heard that he had 
died, Alberigo reveals the poet's extraordinary innovation.  Those who 
have broken the guest laws die in their souls as soon as they do so, so 
that their souls go to hell, leaving their bodies alive on earth.  As 
early as Pietro di Dante, some commentators have pointed to a possible 
source in John 13:27, where it is said that, shortly after Judas 
betrayed Jesus at the Last Supper, Satan entered into Judas.

	See M. Fiorilla, "'Et descendant in infernum viventes':
^Inf~. XXXIII, 109-57 e il Salmo 54," ^L'Alighieri~ 27 (2006): 133-39,
who, departing from Dante's similar remark in ^Convivio~ (IV.vii.10-16),
finds a source for this notion (that certain souls go to Hell while
their bodies live on in the world) in Psalm 54:13-16 (55.14-17).

	Atropos is the third of the three Fates (Clotho spins the fabric for 
the skein of our lives, Lachesis lets it out from her distaff, and 
Atropos snips it off at our deaths).

	|134-147.~  To prove his point, Alberigo points out someone he 
believes Dante might know taking his 'winter vacation' here in 
Ptolomea, Branca d'Oria.  He was a Ghibelline nobleman of Genoa who, 
with the help of another family member, treacherously murdered his 
father-in-law, Michel Zanche (see ^Inf~. XXII.88), around 1294.  Thus 
his soul has been down here for six years, while his body is still 
eating, drinking, sleeping, and putting on clothes, as Dante insists.  
History contrived to make Dante's fiction all the more amusing.  
Branca, who was born ca. 1233, lived into his nineties, only dying in 
1325, thus outliving his condemner, Dante.  Perhaps he had the great 
pleasure of reading about his 'wintering' soul as he enjoyed his life 
in Genoa.

	|148-150.~  For the third time Alberigo asks Dante to clear the ice 
from his eyes, and now Dante, having what he wanted from him, simply 
does not do so.  There are those who argue that the protagonist here 
behaves more like a sinner than like a Christian, but by now we should 
be used to his approved form of righteous indignation.  And there is no 
reproof for such behavior from Virgil here.

	|151-157.~  Matching the apostrophe attacking Pisa that ended the 
first part of the canto (vv. 79-90), this one of Genoa concludes the 
visit to Ptolomea, one of the shortest episodes in the ^Inferno~.
