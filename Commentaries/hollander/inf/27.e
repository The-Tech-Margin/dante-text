	|1-2.~  Ulysses' speech ends, his tongue of fire erect (i.e., not 
waving about [^Inf~. XXVI.85-89]) and stilled.

	|3.~  This innocent detail -- Virgil's dismissal of Ulysses -- will 
resurface at v. 21 with the addition of rather striking information 
about the language of Virgil's last words to Ulysses, uttered but not 
recorded here.

	|4-6.~  The next flame-enclosed shade, who will turn out to be a 
modern-day Ulysses, Guido da Montefeltro, was well known enough that he 
never has to be identified in more than indirect ways (vv. 67-78).  
Born ca. 1220, Guido was one of the great Ghibelline captains of the 
last third of the thirteenth century, winning a number of important 
victories for the nonetheless eventually unsuccessful Ghibelline cause. 
 He was reconciled to the Church in 1286, but then took up his 
soldiering against the Guelphs once again, finally desisting only in 
1294.  In 1296 he joined the Franciscan order (v. 67).  However, in the 
following year Pope Boniface VIII cajoled him into re-entering the 
world of military affairs, this time working against the Ghibellines 
(the Colonna family, which held the fortress of Palestrina, Roman 
Praeneste, as detailed in the text [vv. 85-111]).  Guido died in 1298 
in the Franciscan monastery at Assisi.

	While other pairs of preceding cantos contain those who had committed 
the same sin (VII-VIII [the wrathful]; X-XI [heretics]; XV-XVI 
[sodomites]; XXIV-XXV [thieves]), only XXVI and XXVII treat two major 
figures guilty of the same sin, perhaps suggesting how closely Guido 
and Ulysses are related in Dante's imagination.

	|7-15.~  This simile is derived either from various histories (Pietro 
di Dante mentions Orosius and Valerius Maximus [Pietro1, comm. to vv. 
7-12]) or from Ovid (^Ars amatoria~ I.653-656).  The ancient tyrant of 
Agrigento (in Sicily), Phalaris, had the Athenian Perillus construct 
for him a brazen bull in which he could roast his victims alive.  Their 
screams were transformed into what resembled the bellowings of a bull.  
Once the instrument of torture was finished, Phalaris ordered that 
Perillus be its first victim, thus testing his handicraft.  It worked.  
Ovid's moral to the story (^Ars amatoria~ I.655-656) seems to be echoed 
in Dante's verse 8: 'there is no law more just than that the craftsman 
of death should die by his own handicraft.'

	For studies of this simile see Richard Lansing ("Submerged Meanings in 
Dante's Similes [^Inf~. XXVII]," ^Dante Studies~ 94 [1976], pp. 61-69) 
and William Cook and Ronald Herzman ("St. Eustace: A Note on ^Inferno~ 
XXVII," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1976], pp. 137-39), the latter pointing to 
an inverse parallel, found in the ^Golden Legend~, to the martyred St. 
Eustace.

	|16-18.~  These verses make clear for the first time how the mechanics 
of speech of the fraudulent counselors work; their words are formed by 
their tongues, within their fires, and then produced by the tips of 
their flames.  When Guido first appeared (v. 6) he was apparently only 
mumbling about his pain within his flame.

	|19-21.~  Guido's address to Virgil not only insists that the Roman 
poet was speaking his (native -- see ^Inf~. I.68) Lombard, i.e., north 
Italian, dialect, but then offers in evidence his exact words.  What 
are we to understand about the language in which Virgil first addressed 
Ulysses (^Inf~. XXVI.72-75)?  Was it the same as this?  Or is this, as 
seems more likely, the colloquial manner in which he sends him away?  
The entire problem has vexed many a commentator, and no simple 
resolution has as yet emerged.  Now see Francesco Bruni ("^Istra~: una 
falsa ricostruzione dantesca?" in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, ed. 
Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993], pp. 419-28) 
on the problems associated with finding any attested presence of the 
term, in this form, in Dante's Italy and the possibility that it is a 
Dantean coinage.

	|25-27.~  Perhaps because he cannot see clearly from within his flame, 
Guido cannot tell whether Virgil (or Dante, for that matter) is a 
living soul or a dead fellow-sinner, just now come down from Italy to 
spend eternity here.  The reason for Dante's insistence on this detail 
will be made plain when Guido reveals himself only because he does not 
believe that Dante will ever resurface to tell his miserable story.

	|28.~  When Guido died (1298) the peace in Romagna had not yet been 
confirmed, as it was the following year (see Torraca's comm. to 
^Inf~. XXVII.39).  The region of Romagna is situated in the eastern 
north-central part of Italy.

	|33.~  Not only is Guido an Italian (^latino~), he is that Italian 
whom Dante had designated as most noble (^lo nobilissimo nostro 
latino~) in ^Convivio~ IV.xxviii.8.  Commentators have been concerned 
about this apparent contradiction; for an attempt to mitigate it see 
Lino Pertile, "^Inferno~ XXVII.  Il peccato di Guido da Montefeltro," 
^Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti~ 141 (1982-83), 
pp. 171-75.  If, however, Dante had changed his mind about a number of 
his positions in ^Convivio~, as others believe, there is no reason to 
find the contradiction anything less than intentional.  Further, he may 
not have known of Guido's involvement with Boniface when he wrote the 
passage praising him in ^Convivio~.  See the note to ^Inferno~ 
XXVII.106-111.

	Virgil's passing the questioning of Guido (a modern) over to Dante 
reminds us of his insisting on it for Ulysses (an ancient) in the 
previous canto (^Inf~. XXVI.73-75).

	|37-39.~  Dante's reference to Romagna answers Guido's first question: 
there is peace -- of a sort -- there now.

	|40-54.~  Dante now enlightens Guido (and only an expert in the 
political and geographical lore of the region would understand his 
elliptical speech) about the condition of seven cities and fortified 
towns of Romagna, governed by various tyrants: Ravenna, Cervia, 
Forl@i, Rimini, Faenza, Imola, and Cesena.  Guido had 
been in military action in many of them, with mixed results.

	|55-57.~  Having answered some of Guido's concerns (whom he as yet 
does not recognize), Dante asks for a similar favor, offering fame in 
the world as a reward.

	|61-66.~  Guido's response, made familiar to English readers by T. S. 
Eliot as the epigraph to ^The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock~, makes 
it clear that, for him, report among the living would bring infamy, not 
fame.  Since he believes that Dante is a damned soul, and thus unable 
to regain the world of the living, he will speak.  For the ingenious 
argument that Guido knows that Dante is alive, only feigning that he 
does not in order to concoct a self-favoring narrative that Dante will 
carry back to the world, see Joseph Markulin ("Dante's Guido da 
Montefeltro: A Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982], pp. 
25-40).  The first view seems unlikely, because the poet spends so much 
time with the details of Guido's lack of knowledge of Dante's 
condition; the second, because the tale he tells is in fact damning 
enough.

	|67.~  Guido sums up his life in a single line: he went from bad to 
good.  In fact, he went from bad to good to bad again.  Dante may have 
reflected that his own life was exactly the opposite in its movements, 
from good to bad, but then from bad to good.  Guido did not have a 
Beatrice to lead him back to the true path, only a Boniface.

	|70-72.~  Boniface VIII, according to Guido, led him from his life of 
religious retreat back into political machinations.  Like Francesca da 
Rimini, Guido da Montefeltro blames his fall upon another; like her he 
will tell Dante the reasons for it (see ^Inf~. V.119, where Dante asks 
Francesca to tell 'a che e come' (how and by what signs) she came into 
Love's power; Guido will tell Dante 'e come e ^quare~' [Latin 'why,' 
more precisely 'in what respect'] (how and why) the reasons for his 
fall into perdition.

	|75.~  According to contemporary documents, Guido was actually 
referred to as 'the fox.'  His quality of ^astutia~, or 'cunning,' 
further identifies him with Ulysses (see the note to  ^Inf~. 
XXVI.58-63).  For ^astutia~ as an attribute of Guido's 
personality, see Lino Pertile, "^Inferno~ XXVII.  Il peccato di Guido 
da Montefeltro," ^Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed 
Arti~ 141 (1982-83), pp. 166-70.

	|79-81.~  Guido's nautical metaphors clearly relate him, perhaps more 
plainly than before, to Ulysses.  For the curious notice on the part of 
Filippo Villani (in his life of Guido Bonatti) that Guido da 
Montefeltro was 'full of all cunning [^astutia~]' and that he was known 
among the Italians as 'the new Ulysses' see Hollander ("The Tragedy of 
Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 
1980]), p. 142.  This would suggest either that, in Dante's day, Guido 
was actually referred to in this way, or that Filippo, an impassioned 
reader of Dante, is freely interpreting the reason for the 
juxtaposition of these two great figures in ^Inferno~.

	|82-84.~  Guido speaks of his contrition, confession, and satisfaction 
as though they were the merest of conveniences to attain an end.  Do we 
believe, on the strength of this account, that he had actually fooled 
God?

	|85-93.~  Guido's vicious slam of Boniface, with its concomitant 
enthusiasm for the abandoned devotion to crusading, is not in any 
respect at odds with Dante's own thoughts.  Boniface is attacking 
Palestrina and its Christian inhabitants, none of whom had joined the 
Saracens in their re-taking of Acre in 1291, until then the only 
remaining Christian possession in the Holy Land, or gone there only to 
do business with the enemy.  Instead of attacking the infidel (or 
back-sliding Christians) he moves against his co-religionists.  For a 
quite different view, one which holds that Dante was in fact critical 
of earlier papal exhortations to engage in crusading, see Brenda Deen 
Schildgen, "Dante and the Crusades," ^Dante Studies~ 116 (1998), pp. 
95-125.

	Boniface cares nothing for Christians, according to Guido (and Dante). 
 Not only does he not oppose the heathen in order to make war on his 
own, he does not honor his own holy orders, nor those of Guido the 
friar.  The use of the term ^capestro~ (cord) here has implications for 
those who believe that the ^corda~ at ^Inferno~ XVI.106 is a reference 
to Dante's status as a Franciscan.  (See the note to ^Inf~. 
XVI.106-108.)

	|94-97.~  In the fourth century Constantine, suffering from leprosy, 
had Pope Sylvester I brought to him from his cave on Soracte (where he 
was in hiding because of Constantine's persecution of Christians) to 
cure him.  When the pontiff did so, Constantine converted to 
Christianity (and ended up in paradise, according to Dante [^Par~. 
XX.55-60]); but he also out of gratitude gave Sylvester authority over 
the western empire, centered in the city of Rome.  (See the note to 
^Inf~. XIX.115-117.)

	|102.~  Penestrino is modern Palestrina and was ancient Praeneste.  
The Colonna family were in rebellion against Boniface's authority and 
had defended themselves in this fortress.

	|103-105.~  Boniface's claim is utterly false, as Guido will learn.  
His reference to Celestine V here makes it seem all the more likely 
that it is he who is referred to in ^Inferno~ III.59-60 (see the note 
to ^Inf~. III.58-60).

	|106-111.~  Silence as a defensive weapon against this pope was 
probably the only way out; but his imposing insistence was too much for 
Guido, and he makes his bargain.

	A continuing debate follows verse 110.  Did Dante read these words in 
chroniclers who preceded him (e.g., Riccobaldo of Ferrara, Francesco 
Pipino of Bologna, both of whom wrote before 1313, if we are not sure 
exactly when), or did they get them from Dante?  For the key texts in 
the dispute see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. XXVII.67).  Some 
contemporary commentators (e.g., Bosco, introductory note to ^Inf~. 
XXVII) favor the precedence of Riccobaldo's chronicle, perhaps written 
between 1308 and 1313, and believe that Dante's account (and revision 
of his former positive view of Guido) derive from it.

	|112-114.~  Markulin ("Dante's Guido da Montefeltro: A 
Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982], pp. 25-40) considers the 
possibility that Guido has invented the battle between St. Francis and 
the black Cherub (a member of the second highest rank of angels, 
associated with knowledge).  Discomfort with the scene has been abroad 
for a while.  Castelvetro (comm. to verse 114) did not hide his 
annoyance, seeing that Dante had portrayed the soul of Francis as 
having made an error in thinking that Guido was to be saved and thus 
could not possibly have been sent from heaven by God (and was 
consequently wasting his time), for which reasons he criticizes Dante 
for not speaking with greater reverence.

	Guido's son Bonconte will be caught up in a similar struggle between 
devil and angel, with the angel winning (^Purg~. V.104-105).  Such a 
scene may find justification in medieval popularizing art, but 
Castelvetro is right to complain about its theological absurdities.  On 
the other hand, Dante is writing a poem and not a treatise.  That he 
repeats the motif would seem to indicate that we are meant to take it 
'seriously.'  See the note to ^Inf~. XXIII.131.

	|116.~  Perhaps the most discussed issue in these two neighboring 
cantos is developed from this verse.  What precisely is 'fraudulent 
advice' (^consiglio frodolente~)?  Is it the sin that condemns Guido?  
Is Ulysses, in the previous canto, condemned for the same sin?  
Fraudulent counsel is giving someone evil advice (whether or not it is 
effective advice) or acting in such fraudulent ways as to lead others 
into harming themselves.  Since Virgil leaves the sins of the eighth 
and ninth ^bolgia~ unnamed (see ^Inf~. XI.52-60 and note), this is the 
only indication we have for a clear determination of the sin punished 
in these two cantos.  Any other solution seems less satisfactory, if 
there have been many who have been eager to try to find one.  The 
American debate in the last century was initiated by Anna Hatcher's 
claim ("Dante's Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro," ^Dante Studies~ 88 
[1970], pp. 109-17) that Guido's sin was not false counsel; her view 
was countered by James G. Truscott ("Ulysses and Guido," ^Dante 
Studies~ 91 [1973], pp. 47-72), but then affirmed by Markulin ("Dante's 
Guido da Montefeltro: A Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982], 
pp. 25-40).  As the reader has noted, debates about the nature of the 
precise sins referred to in various passages (e.g., ^Inf~. VII, XI, XV 
[see discussions at the notes to ^Inf~. VII.118-126; ^Inf~. XI.76-90; 
and ^Inf~. XV.13-21]) are a fairly frequent feature of Dante studies 
and often involve considerable ingenuity.

	|118-120.~  While Dante, in ^Convivio~ III.xiii.2, clearly states that 
fallen angels cannot philosophize, since love is a basic requirement of 
true philosophizing and they are without love, it is clear that they 
can use logic, one of the tools of philosophy.

	|124.~  This fallen angel does the 'right thing' and stops his descent 
with his victim at Minos.  See the note to ^Inf~. XXI.39.

	|128-132.~  Unlike Ulysses, who ends his speech with a certain 
majesty, Guido insists upon his bitterness, realizing eternally his 
foolishness in his having given over his chance for love and salvation 
when he did the bidding of Boniface.  The canto opens with Ulysses' 
flame calm and steady (vv. 1-2) and ends with that of Guido writhing.
