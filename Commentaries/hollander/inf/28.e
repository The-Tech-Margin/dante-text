	|1-6.~  For Dante's disclaimer of the ability to describe the blood 
and wounds that surpass both words and memory (even were he to revert 
to prose to do so) see Virgil's similar disclaimer in (^Aen~. 
VI.625-627): 'And if I had a hundred tongues and as many mouths, along 
with a voice of iron, I could not put together all the shapes of crime 
nor run through all the catalogue of torments.'  The passage was first 
cited by Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to XXVIII.1-3) and is now a 
commonplace in the commentaries.  It is remembered probably even more 
evidently at ^Paradiso~ XXIII.55-59, as was perhaps first noted by 
Tommaseo (comm. to ^Par~. XXIII.55-57).

	|7-21.~  This elliptical version of a simile, so rich in its catalogue 
of the horrors of war, involves four battles (or series of battles), 
two of them ancient, two modern, roughly as follows:

\<pre\>
500 BC ca.      Aeneas's Trojans triumph in south and central Italy;
216 BC          Romans are defeated by the Carthaginians at Cannae;
1170 ca.        Robert Guiscard's Normans defeat the Saracens;
1266 & 1268     Manfred and then Conradin are defeated by Charles of Anjou.
\</pre\>

In this series of military actions the Roman and/or imperial side first 
wins, then loses disastrously.  The intrinsic view of history here is 
more chaotic than directed.  Absent is Dante's more optimistic view of 
history unfolding as a Roman and Christian manifestation of the spirit 
moving through history to its appointed goal (if this sounds like 
Hegel, it is meant to).  And we might further reflect that winning and 
losing battles has little to do with one's final destination in God's 
plan: Aeneas wins, but is in Limbo (^Inf~. IV.122), Robert Guiscard 
wins and is in heaven (^Par~. XVIII.48), Manfred loses and is on his 
way to heaven (^Purg~. III.112).

	For Dante's relation to martial epic, a genre surely drawn to our 
attention by these scenes of war, see Hollander ("Dante and the Martial 
Epic," ^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989]), pp. 62-91 (tr. ital. "Dante e l'epopea 
marziale," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989], pp. 93-113).  And for the 
related question of Dante's relationship to Guittone d'Arezzo as 'epic 
poet' (as well as rival in love lyric), see the essays by Gorni, 
Antonelli, and Mazzoni in ^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo centenario 
della morte: Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo (22-24 aprile 
1994)~, ed. M. Picone (Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995), pp. 307-83; see 
also Teodolinda Barolini ("Guittone's ^Ora parr@a~, Dante's ^Doglia 
mi reca~, and the ^Commedia~'s Anatomy of Desire," in ^Seminario 
Dantesco Internazionale: Atti del primo convegno tenutosi al Chauncey 
Conference Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z. G. Baranski 
[Florence: Le Lettere, 1997], pp. 3-23).  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~ 
(II.ii.7-8) Dante had listed only Bertran de Born (see the note to 
^Inf~. XXVIII.130-138) as a poet of ^salus~, or 'arms,' that is, a 
writer of 'epic.'  Since his presence is so amply felt in this canto, 
starting with these lines, a redoing of the opening of Bertran's 
canzone 'Si tuit li dol,' as a number of twentieth-century commentators 
have observed, we may surmise that Dante here, possibly for the first 
time, thinks of the epic resonance of his own poem.  And while he seems 
to present martial epic as essentially the expression of the brutality 
of war, in the mode of Bertran, the fact that his poem here involves 
itself in the matter of martial epic may have made him feel that he 
himself had some title as a practitioner in this mode, where in ^De 
vulgari~ he was himself obviously not at all interested in it (there he 
presented himself as a 'poet of rectitude,' not of 'arms').  Mario 
Fubini ("^Inferno~: canto XXVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~, dir. 
Mario Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1962)], pp. 999-1021) 
refers to this as the 'canto delle armi' in which Dante becomes 'il 
Bertram italiano' (p. 1005).  A countering view is presented by 
Mazzotta (^Dante's Vision and the Circle of Knowledge~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1993], pp. 75-95), who sees this canto as 
Dante's 'farewell to arms.'  Once could argue that, since Dante had 
never done poetry of a martial kind before, this is more like his 
'hello.'  Many years ago the director Sam Peckinpaugh was asked in an 
interview on television why there was so much insistent, close-up, 
slow-motion depiction of violence in his film ^The Wild Bunch~.  He 
replied that by so presenting it he had hoped to repel his audience, 
instilling in them a great dislike of such anti-social activity.  Bill 
Russell, the Boston Celtics star center at the time, his interlocutor, 
was convincingly dubious both as to the intended effect and to the 
motives of Mr. Peckinpaugh.  While Dante's position here would also 
seem to look down on 'mere' martial epic, with all its pointless 
slaughter, he nonetheless reveals an aptitude for the genre.

	|9-11.~  Puglia (Apulia) here, most commentators agree, is meant in 
its wider sense, i.e., not only the southeast portion of the Italian 
peninsula, but the region including Lazio.  The Trojans are then Aeneas 
and his men (some believe the reference is to the later Romans).  The 
'long war' is the second Punic War (218-201 B.C.), during which the 
Romans suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Hannibal's 
Carthaginian forces at Cannae (216 B.C.) in Apulia.  Historians relate 
that after the battle an envoy of Hannibal showed the Carthaginian senate the 
vast number of gold rings taken from the fingers of noble Romans killed 
in the battle.

	|12.~  The problem of the extent of Dante's knowledge of Livy remains 
a vexed one.  See Antonio Martina, 'Livio, Tito' (ED.1971.3), for a 
summary and bibliography through 1965 (especially important are the 
studies of Giuseppe Billanovich).  Commentators point out that Dante 
here would rather seem to be following Orosius (or Augustine) than 
Livy, but still appeals to Livy as the most authoritative historian of 
Rome.  His vast compendium, ^Ab urbe condita~, did not come through the 
ages intact; precisely which parts of it were known to Dante is not 
known to us.

	|13-14.~  Robert Guiscard, a Norman, won many victories in Puglia ca. 
1160-80 to consolidate his power as duke of the region, including what 
for Dante was the most important one, that over the Saracens, which 
apparently gained him his place in ^Paradiso~ XVIII.48.

	|15-16.~  The text alludes to Manfred's disastrous loss, occasioned, 
in Dante's view, by the betrayal of his Apulian allies, at the battle 
near Ceperano that was prologue to his final defeat and death at the 
hands of the forces of the French king Charles of Valois at the battle 
of Benevento (1266).  Manfred is the first saved soul found once Dante 
begins his ascent of the mount of purgatory (^Purg~. III.112).

	|17-18.~  Two years after the defeat at Benevento, the Ghibelline 
Norman forces, now under Conradin, the grandson of the emperor 
Frederick II, suffered their final defeat near Tagliacozzo, in the 
Abruzzi, again at the hands of the forces of Charles of Anjou, who, 
after the battle, had Conradin put to death, thus ending the Angevin 
succession in Italy.  Alardo was the French knight $Erard de Val$ery, 
who gave Charles the strategic advice that gained him military 
advantage on the field.

	|19-21.~  This image, suggesting layers of excavated battlefields, 
each containing vast areas of wounded soldiers holding out their 
mutilated limbs, gives us some sense of Dante's view of the end result 
of war, sheer human butchery.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to XXVIII.1-21) 
suggest that this ^bolgia~ brings into mind the image of a huge 
slaughterhouse.

	For the Virgilian resonance (^Aen~. II.361-362) of these lines see, 
again, Tommaseo (comm. to these vv.).  This is Aeneas's response when 
he must tell the terrible carnage during the night of the fall of Troy.

	|22-31.~  This disgusting image of Mohammed derives from Dante's 
conviction that the prophet was in fact a Christian whose schismatic 
behavior took the form of founding (in 630) what Dante considered a 
rival sect rather than a new religion, Islam.  Thus Mohammed reveals 
himself as divided in two.  For the earliest (and varied) responses to 
the presence of Mohammed in the poem, see Paola Locatin, "Maometto 
negli antichi commenti alla ^Commedia~," ^L'Alighieri~ 20 (2002), 
pp. 41-75.

	|32-33.~  Al@i, disciple, cousin, and son-in-law of Mohammed, 
became the fourth leader of the Muslims.  But the issues surrounding 
his succession in 656 divided them into two factions, Sunni and Shiite, 
that continue to this day.

	|35.~  All punished here are described by this verse.  'Scandal,' in 
this sense, means a promulgated doctrine that leads others to stumble 
and lose their way to the truth.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa 
theologica~ II-II, q. 43, a. 1, resp., on the Greek word ^skandalon~, 
or 'stumbling-block.'  Thus all here either cause schism in others or 
themselves lead schismatic groups, the first three religious (Mohammed, 
Al@i, Fra Dolcino), the last five political (Pier da Medicina, 
Malatestino, Curio, Mosca, Bertran de Born).

	|37-40.~  The unseen devil of this ditch joins the cast of devils of 
the Malebolge, the whippers of the first ^bolgia~ and the hookers of 
the fifth.  In this case there seems to be one devil alone, perhaps 
intended to remind the reader of the solitary Cherub, with flaming 
sword, sent to guard the Garden after Adam and Eve had been ejected 
from it (Genesis 3:24).  (See ^Purg~. VIII.25-27, where this passage is 
more clearly alluded to.)  It is only in Malebolge that we find such 
creatures.

	|43-45.~  Mohammed evidently believes that Dante is one of the dead 
sinners.  But how or why he thinks that such as they can loiter in 
hell, doing a bit of sightseeing before they go to judgment, is not 
easily explained.  Virgil's response (v. 49) makes it clear that only 
he, in this pair of visitors, is a dead soul.

	|55-60.~  Disabused of his erring view, Mohammed uses the occasion to 
send a message to his fellow in religious schism, Fra Dolcino.  A 
northerner, from Novara (balancing the southern setting of the opening 
of the canto), Dolcino Tornielli was the head, from ca. 1300, of a 
group known as the Apostolic Brethren (^gli Apostolici~).  This 'order' 
had as its aim the restoration of the simplicity of apostolic times to 
the Christian religion.  Its enemies accused Dolcino of holding 
heretical ideas, such as the community of goods and women (see Oelsner, 
comm. to these verses).  It did not help Dolcino's case that he was 
accompanied by a beautiful woman, Margaret of Trent, reputed to be his 
mistress.  Pope Clement V preached a crusade against the Brethren in 
1305.  In 1307, starved out by their enemies in the high country to 
which they had retreated, the Brethren were captured.  Margaret and 
Dolcino were burned at the stake.

	|61-63.~  Mohammed's placement of his suspended foot is read by some 
as a mere 'realistic detail.'  Rasha Al-Sabah ("^Inferno~ XXVIII: The 
Figure of Muhammad," ^Yale Italian Studies~ 1 [1977], pp. 147-61) 
argues for an iconographic reading, based in a passage in St. Thomas on 
a passage in Proverbs (6:12-19), in which 'a wicked man with lying 
mouth, sewing discord,' has 'feet that are swift in running to 
mischief.'  His posture, one foot suspended, may also refer to the 
Greek term (^skandalon~) for 'stumbling-block,' found at ^Inferno~ 
XXVIII.35.

	|65.~  This bloodied figure, thus sliced by the sword-wielding devil, 
will be revealed as Pier da Medicina at v. 73.  For the reminiscence of 
Virgil's description of the disfigured visage of Deiphobus (^Aen~. 
VI.494-497), similarly deprived of his nose, see Scartazzini (comm. to 
XXVIII.64) and many later commentators.

	|68.~  Pier opens his windpipe to speak, since the devil's cut had 
wounded him there, thus preventing his breath from reaching his mouth.

	|70-75.~  The early commentators are not sure exactly who Pier of 
Medicina (a town between Bologna and Imola) was, but Dante and he 
apparently knew one another.  While the nature of his schismatic 
behavior thus lies in shadow, the fact that his ensuing remarks refer 
to political intrigue would seem to mark him also as a political, 
rather than a religious, schismatic.

	On verses 74-75 see Ignazio Baldelli, "'Lo dolce piano che da Vercelli 
a Marcab@o dichina': ^Inferno~ XXVIII, 74-75," ^Lettere Italiane~ 
47 (1995), pp. 193-202.

	|76-81.~  Pier refers, in his prophecy, which parallels that given by 
Mohammed, initially to two victims of 'schism,' Guido del Cassero and 
Angiolello di Carignano, first identified by Guiniforto in 1440 (comm. 
to XXVIII.76-84), and then to the victimizer, Malatestino Malatesta, 
lord of Rimini.  (He is referred to as 'the younger mastiff' in the 
last canto at ^Inf~. XXVII.46.)  The details are not known to any 
commentators, but apparently Dante knew that these two leaders of the 
city of Fano were tricked by Malatestino into coming to confer with him 
at the town of La Cattolica.  His men caught them in their ship on 
their way (or after they left) and drowned them.

	The passage has caused some dispute.  Malatestino only came into.power 
in Rimini after the death of his father in 1312.  This fact causes such 
as Petrocchi ("Intorno alla pubblicazione dell'^Inferno~ e del 
^Purgatorio~," ^Convivium~ 25 [1957], pp. 659-60) to argue that this is 
a second example of Dante's posterior revision of the text of the first 
^cantica~ (see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.79-87).  However, and as 
Chiavacci Leonardi contends (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ 
[Milan: Mondadori, 1991], p. 845), the present tense for Malatestino's 
rulership is used, not by the poet, but by Pier da Medicina, and he is 
speaking in 1300.  Two other things should also be noted: first, 
Malatestino was ^co-ruler~ of Rimini with his father, Malatesta, in 
1295 or soon thereafter; second, the date of the incident referred to 
has never been established, since no commentator has any information 
about it.  Still further, the reference to Malatestino in the previous 
canto has him functioning with his father in nefarious deeds ca. 1295.  
For at least these reasons there is no cause to believe that Dante is 
here referring to Malatestino's perfidy as occurring in 1312 or later.

	|82-84.~  Unriddled, the passage means that the entire Mediterranean 
Sea never witnessed so great a crime.  For the phrase 'gente argolica,' 
meaning 'Greeks,' a synecdoche based on the part (the denizens of 
Argos) for the whole (Greece) see (^Aen~. II.78), as was noted by 
Torraca in 1905 (comm. to these verses).

	|85-87.~  Malatestino, one-eyed, holds Rimini, the city that Curio (v. 
102) wishes he had never seen (because it was there that he offered the 
advice that condemns him to this punishment).

	|89-90.~  The two men of Fano (v. 76) will have no need of prayer for 
help against the tricky winds off Focara's point because they will be 
dead.

	|91-93.~  Dante, his appetite whetted by Pier's elliptical phrasing at 
v. 87, wants him to expand.

	|96-102.~  Pier opens the tongueless mouth of Curio, seen as a 
schismatic for his advice to Caesar to march on Rome, thus destroying 
the Republic and causing the civil wars.  For Curio in Lucan and Dante, 
see Stull and Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 63 (1991 [1997]), pp. 27-28.

	|103-108.~  The description of Mosca dei Lamberti is one of the most 
affecting in this canto filled with affective moments.  Mosca was among 
those Florentine citizens mentioned by Ciacco (^Inf~. VI.80) as having 
attempted to do good in the divided city; for his crime, of those 
mentioned he is the farthest down in hell.  A fervent Ghibelline, in 
1216 he urged the murder of Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, who, engaged 
to a girl of the Amidei family, married a Donati instead.  The result 
of this killing was the origin of the bitter rivalry between the Amidei 
and the Donati, Ghibellines and Guelphs respectively, and of the civil 
discord that tore Florence apart.  Mosca is thus seen as a modern-day 
Curio, urging the powerful to do what in their hearts they must have 
known was not to be done.

	His words, 'a done deed finds its purpose,' so mercilessly laconic, 
now cause him enough by way of regret that we can sense some 
justification in Ciacco's original characterization of him.

	|109-111.~  Dante is nonetheless stern in his criticism of Mosca, not 
accepting his gesture of penitence, and Mosca is left with his deserved 
heartbreak.  There is no zest for the wicked in this poet.

	|115-117.~  The poet's self-assurance, playful though it certainly is, 
may offend some readers.  He can narrate what is to follow because he 
knows he actually saw the next scene, a shade carrying his severed 
head.  For the motif of the decapitated corpse see Paola Allegretti 
("^Chi poria mai pur con parole sciolte~ [^Inf.~. XXVIII]," ^Tenzone~ 2 
[2001], pp. 9-25), pp. 9-10.

	|130-138.~  Bertran de Born, one of the great poets of war of his or 
any time (and thus greatly admired by Ezra Pound in the last century) 
loved to see destruction of towns and men.  One thinks of Robert 
Duvall's character in Francis Ford Coppolla's film ^Apocalyse Now~, who 
loved the smell of napalm in the morning.  His plangent tone, as he 
opens his remarks to Dante, would have bothered him considerably, had 
he been able to read this scene -- and perhaps Dante thought exactly 
this himself, as he composed them.  It is often pointed out that v. 132 
is a reprise of a passage in the Lamentations of Jeremiah (1:12), 
already cited by Dante in the opening verses of an 'exploded' sonnet in 
(^VN~ VII.3) to express his own solitary sadness in love.  In a sense, 
they are part of Bertran's punishment, the 'tough guy' portrayed as 
self-pitying.

	Bertran was a Gascon nobleman of the second half of the twelfth 
century.  His poetry, which is reflected in several passages in this 
canto, is not the subject of his discourse.  Rather, he condemns 
himself for his implacable schismatic actions at the English court, 
where he supported and encouraged the rebellious plotting of Prince 
Henry against his own father, Henry II, king of the realm.  For a text 
that.1 encapsulates the problem presented in Bertran and all the other 
political schismatics, see Luke 11:17: 'Every kingdom divided against 
itself is brought to desolation' (cited by Marianne Shapiro in "The 
Fictionalization of Bertran de Born [^Inf~. XXVIII]," ^Dante Studies~ 
92 [1974], p. 114).

	For the reference to Ahitophel's similar support and encouragement of 
Absalom's rebellion against ^his~ father, King David, see II Samuel 
15:7-18:15).

	On Bertran's poetry see Michelangelo Picone, "I trovatori di Dante: 
Bertran de Born," ^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~ 19  (1979), 
pp. 71-94.  For its resonance in the verses of this canto see Paola 
Allegretti ("^Chi poria mai pur con parole sciolte~ [^Inf.~. XXVIII]," 
^Tenzone~ 2 [2001], pp. 9-18).

	|142.~  The word ^contrapasso~ is generally understood to be based on 
an Aristotelian term in its Latin translation, ^contrapassum~, used in 
the same sense that the biblical concept of retribution, expressed in 
the Latin ^lex talionis~ (the taking of an eye for an eye, etc.), is 
understood to have.  That is, one does something wrong and receives the 
appropriate punishment for doing it.  Out of the Hebrew and 
Aristotelian concept (the latter refined by Thomas's commentary on 
Aristotle), Dante supposedly developed this idea, which is given a  
name here, but has been operative since we saw the first sinners in 
hell, the neutrals, in Canto III.  For a lengthy and helpful gloss, see 
Singleton (comm. to this verse).  Valerio Lucchesi ("Giustizia divina e 
linguaggio umano.  Metafore e polisemie del contrapasso dantesco," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)], pp. 53-126)  has mounted a complex 
argument attempting to deny this positive understanding of the term by 
Dante on the basis of its instability as a concept that St. Thomas 
actually embraces.  For a thorough review of the entire question and of 
Dante's possible sources for the term (and understanding of them) see 
Peter Armour, "Dante's ^contrapasso~: Context and Texts," ^Italian 
Studies~ 55 (2000), pp. 1-20.
