	|1-3.~ Dante has gone white with cowardice. Seeing this, Virgil tries
to compose his own features. In canto VIII.121 (^Inf~. VIII.121)
Virgil was angry, and this fact leads many commentators to believe that
the color in his face now is still the red flush of anger. On the
other hand, others believe (and over the centuries there are roughly as
many of one opinion as of the other) that Virgil's ^new~ color just now is
the pallor of frustration and shame. Either reading is possible.
Guido da Pisa believed Virgil had gone pale, supporting this view with
a citation of the ^Aeneid~ (I.209-210), where Aeneas, 'sick with care,
feigns hope in his face while stifling the anguish deep in his heart.'
If the poet had this passage in mind, it would seem likely that he
imagined Virgil, like Aeneas feeling defeated but needing to raise the
spirits of whoever depends on him, having turned from florid to pale in
facial color and now trying to compose himself. However, Dante's verb,
^ristrinse~, literally 'restrained' or 'clamped down on,' would be much
more appropriate to controlling anger than ridding oneself of malaise.
Either reading is supportable, but red is probably the better choice,
especially since we then have the dramatic contrast between
white-cheeked Dante and red-faced Virgil.

	|4.~ For the 'improper' or 'false' simile, a comparison in which
the tenor and vehicle would seem to refer to the same entity
('he was struggling as does a man trying to explain a difficult
concept'), see Eric S. Mallin, "The False Simile in Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 (1984): 15-36. See also Richard
Lansing, ^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1977) for a previous and somewhat
different discussion of this phenomenon, as Mallin reports.

	|7-9.~ Virgil's doubt and ensuing confirmation has caused
considerable difficulty, in particular the clause 'tal ne s'offerse'
(v. 8). There has been debate over the validity of this reading in the
Italian text, and over the meaning of this particular choice, accepted
by most as being the most likely. Most commentators are certain that
the ^tal~ ('such' or 'such a one') refers to Beatrice, whether
specifically or in general (e.g., such aid was offered to us [by
Beatrice]). Virgil's general thought in the tercet is, however, probably
clear enough: 'We must win this fight unless (I did not understand what
Beatrice told me).... No, what she said must be true; but I wish the
promised help from heaven would get here.' Musa's remark on the
passage bears repeating (^Advent at the Gates~ [Bloomington, IN:
Indiana University Press, 1974]), p. 73: 'because during his lifetime
[Virgil] could not believe in the coming of Christ, so now he can not
believe in the coming of the angel -- in spite of his having learned
from Beatrice that the Pilgrim's journey is willed in Heaven.' In
other words, Virgil, condemned to hell for not having had faith,
repeats that error even now.

	|10-15.~ A fairly rare example of an interpretive exercise embedded
in the poetic text itself, Dante as glossator of Virgil's words and
presenter of his own understanding as he heard them. What he thought,
then, was perhaps that Virgil was afraid that they would be left in
hell, in which case Dante would have perished.

	|17.~ The 'first circle' is Limbo, where Virgil and the other
virtuous heathens have their eternal resting place, and where, in his
own words, 'without hope we live in longing' (^Inf~. IV.42).

	|19-27.~ Virgil's narrative of his having had his spirit conjured
from the dead by the witch Erichtho may have reassured the protagonist;
it has raised nothing but questions among Dante scholars. Boccaccio
(comm. to ^Inf~. IX.25-27), Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~.
IX.25-27), and Francesco da Buti (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.16-30), in their
respective commentaries, correctly understand that Dante is here
inventing new material, unsanctioned by any classical source. In fact,
this may be the single most outrageous example of the utter liberty
Dante at times employs in his treatment of classical literature. No
such tale exists in any other text before Dante's, nor anything like
it. While many point to the similar statement made by the Sibyl,
hoping to reassure Aeneas that she has been shown by Hecate
(Proserpina) the places of the underworld (^Aen~. VI.562-565), no one
has come close to finding a source for a Virgilian journey to the
depths of hell under the spell of Erichtho. This Thessalian witch
appears in a crucial role in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, the later poet's
rather nasty version of Virgil's more benign Sibyl. In a lengthy
episode in the sixth book (vv. 507-830) of Lucan's poem, a book with
evident parallels to the descent to the underworld in the ^Aeneid~,
replete with Sibyl-like guide in the person of Erichtho, the witch
holds center stage. Serving the curiosity of Sextus Pompeius, son of
the great Pompey, one of the major republican opponents of Caesar in
the civil war, she agrees to foretell the outcome of the war by
practicing her necromantic art on the corpse of a recently slain
soldier. What the soldier tells is hardly pleasant news, but is hardly
complete, either. He does make plain to Sextus that the ghost of his
father will come to him in Sicily (Lucan, ^Phars~. VI.812-813) in order
to reveal still more (but Lucan committed suicide by Nero's order
before finishing the poem, and the scene was not written). It is out
of these materials that Dante has concocted his idiosyncratic tale. To
what end? Surely it besmirches Virgil, whom we first hear of, in
^Inferno~ II, as being given a much different posthumous treatment by
Beatrice, who 'harrowed' him from Limbo for six days of duty in the
Christian afterworld. Now it turns out that this was not the only
time, that he had previously been used for nefarious purpose by
Erichtho. And what is it that she wanted? In Lucan's poem (^Phars~.
VI.586-587) we learn that her greatest desire is to be able to mangle
the corpses of Julius Caesar (the poem is set before the murder of
Caesar -- 44 BC) and of Pompey. Virgil died in 19 BC. As he says in
this narrative, Erichtho called him (like the young soldier in Lucan's
poem, only recently dead) back into his body shortly after he died and
sent him down to the ninth Circle, Judecca (apparently bearing that
name even before Judas committed suicide in 34 AD -- or else Virgil is
merely using the current form of it). Why? Those who have written on
this problem have not developed any hypothesis to account for her
motive. Yet Dante surely would have given her one in the myth that he
was constructing. Or Virgil is simply making up a tall story in order
to give himself authority -- a dubious hypothesis embraced by some.
But for the view that his account rather undermines than girds that
authority see Stefano Prandi, "I gesti di Virgilio," ^Giornale storico
della letteratura italiana~ 172 (1995), pp. 56-57. And for more on
this problem see Sonia Gentili ("La necromanzia di Eritone da Lucano a
Dante," in ^Dante e il "locus inferni": Creazione letteraria e
tradizione interpretativa~, ed. Simona Fo@a e Sonia Gentili (Rome:
Bulzoni, 2000 [= ^Studi (e testi) italiani~ 4 (1999)], pp. 13-43).

	We know from Lucan that Erichtho had an unfulfilled ambition, to
ravage the corpses of Caesar and Pompey. Where are these located in
Dante?	Caesar is in Limbo; of Pompey we hear little (Dante is as spare
in his mention of him as is Virgil), and nothing about his station in
the afterlife.	Since saved pagans always seem to merit Dante's notice
(Ripheus, Cato, Statius, and Trajan) we can probably safely assume
that Pompey is not one of these. If he is then to be considered one
of the damned, where would he be found? Of the four great republican
figures in the civil wars, Cato is in purgatory and on his way to
heaven, Brutus and Cassius are in hell, precisely in the ninth Circle.
Is Pompey there as well? It seems a likely possibility. Lucan has
him translated to the heavens after his murder and deified (^Phars~.
IX.1-18); Dante surely admired his youthful achievements (^Par~. VI.53)
and apparently avoided making him noticeable among the damned.	However,
it is at least possible that he is playing a game with his reader here.
As a co-conspirator of Brutus and Cassius, would Pompey not naturally have
been punished along with them, since he is not, like Cato, miraculously
saved?	With this subtlest of hints, in other words, Dante invites us
to imagine that his version of Erichtho sent Virgil to accomplish the
Pompey part of her unfulfilled purpose. (A student, Sara Van Rheenan,
Princeton '90, has gone so far as to suggest that Pompey was the third
sinner in Satan's jaws before Judas replaced him in 34 AD.)

	Virgil does not tell us whether he actually brought back a spirit from
the depths or not. Dante's invention is probably outrageous enough as
it stands. But we can perhaps glimpse the justification of Erichtho's
wish, her delayed victory over dead Pompey, as well as the strange
fulfillment of Erichtho's and Lucan's promise of a return to the earth
of Pompey's ghost. It seems a notion worth considering. And if that
hypothesis seems overbold, we can retreat to a simpler but even
less likely one, leaving the soul of Pompey in relative obscurity and
peace: Virgil is sent down to bring back either Brutus or Cassius. In
fact some sixty years ago Ernesto Trucchi attempted exactly such an
explanation, arguing, with no further justification, that Virgil was
sent down to bring back Brutus (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.22-30). Gregorio Di
Siena had already suggested that Virgil had been sent down to move
Dido, at first placed in Judecca for betraying Sichaeus [!], from there
to the Circle of lust (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.23). Whatever justification
we seek for this strange tale of Virgil's first visit to the realm of
the damned, we probably should try to find it in the pages of Lucan.

	Boccaccio was the first and perhaps lone discussant (comm. to ^Inf~.
IX.25-27) to think of the only biblical tale that contains similar
elements (and was surely familiar to Dante), the story of Saul's visit
to the witch of Endor, who calls up the spirit of Samuel for Saul; the
latter -- in a scene more powerful than even anything in Lucan --
foretells Saul's death and the defeat of the Israelites at the hands of
the Philistines (I Samuel 28:3-25).

	|27.~ Judecca, the ninth Circle, named for Judas, betrayer, like all
those punished there with him, of a rightful lord and master.

	|28-30.~ His tale told, Virgil's point is clear: 'I have been all the
way down to the bottom of the pit; you can trust in my guidance.' The
'heaven that encircles all' is almost certainly the Crystalline Sphere,
or ^primum mobile~. If the verb ^girare~ here has the sense of 'makes
turn,' and not 'surrounds,' as some believe, the reference then is
surely to the Crystalline Sphere, for it sets all the rest of the
spheres in motion, even though it is itself motionless. As for the
choice between ^girare~ as 'cause to turn' or 'make a circle around,'
all the early commentators who deal with the term think in terms of the
latter. However, from the sixteenth century until halfway into the
twentieth the large majority of commentators chose the former, citing
^Paradiso~ XXVIII.70, where the ^primum mobile~ is described as setting
the other spheres in motion in somewhat similar terms to what might be
expressed here. Currently, following the observation of Porena (comm.
to ^Inf~. IX.25-27) that, since the earth in not in motion in Dante's
astronomy, the verb in this sense cannot apply to 'all,' most
commentators have returned to the earlier understanding. It is
probably of some import that the earliest commentators, probably with a
closer sense of Dante's vocabulary than ours, choose as they do.
Further, Dante only rarely uses ^girare~ in the second sense discussed
here, more usually using the first. There are some four dozen uses of
^girare~ in the poem, and relatively rarely does the verb seem to have
the sense of 'cause a thing to move in a circular path,' e.g., ^Inf~.
XXVI.139; ^Inf~. XXXIV.6; ^Purg~. XIX.62; ^Par~. XXI.81; ^Par~.
XXII.119; ^Par~. XXIV.14. Far more often (some 17 times) the verb is
used as a synonym of ^ire~, 'to go,' but it is not easy always to
disambiguate this use from ^girare~ as 'to move in a circle,' which is
by far the more usual usage in the poem (some 23 times).

	|33.~ There is debate among commentators as to what exactly this
sentence means. It seems more likely that the ^ira~ ('wrath') referred
to is the righteous anger of the forces of God (namely, the angel who
is now approaching) rather than the wrath the travelers will encounter
in the forces defending the City of Dis, as Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~.
IX.30-33) believes, or the 'wrath' they must employ in order to enter
the city (the view of most of the early commentators). In the
nineteenth century first Gregorio Di Siena (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.33,
haltingly, and then, in a cogent exposition, Andrea Scartazzini (comm.
to ^Inf~. IX.33), advanced the view that the 'wrath' in question is
represented by the angel's assault upon the closed city. That seems
the most convincing reading. Among modern discussants, see
Casagrande's strong defense of this angelic hypothesis ("Dante e Filippo
Argenti: riscontri patristici e note di critica testuale," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 51 [1978], pp. 233-35). And for textual confirmation of
this view see v. 106, below, where Virgil and Dante, after the angel's
intervention, enter the city of Dis without further struggle.

	|37.~ The swamp is the river Styx.

	|38-48.~ 'The three Erinyes or Furies, Alecto, Megaera, and
Tisiphone, who dwelt in the depths of Hell and punished men both in this
world and after death' ("Erine," in Toynbee, ^Concise Dante Dictionary~
(Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 [1898]). See Aeneid VI.570-575.  In Virgil, as in
Greek myth, these three sisters are punishers of crimes of blood. Dante
sees them as the handmaids of Proserpina (or Hecate), the queen of hell.
What has not often been pointed out (but see the interesting gloss by
Poletto [comm. vv. 46-48]) is that, while in the ^Aeneid~ each of the three
Furies is named, their names never appear together (Megaera in XII.846,
Alecto in VII.324, and Tisiphone in VI.555, VI.571, and X.761).  Pietro di
Dante (comm. vv. 34-48) cites an anonymous poem for the following passage,
apparently as his father's source: ^Tres agitant mentes Furie, ratione
carentes. / Tunc est |Tesiphone~
^ cum res est pessima mente; / at cum mente
fera dispumat in ore |Megera~^; / re perpetrata tunc est |Alecto~ ^vocata.~

	|51.~ Does the protagonist's fear mark the beginning of his new
cycle of fear, pity, and firmness, the second of five such cycles
in ^Inferno~? For that thesis, see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Princeton, 1969), esp. pp. 303-4, discussed in the note to
^Inf~. II.4-5.  For more on the vacillating presences of these two emotions
in the main character, see also the notes to ^Inf~. IV.19-21 and V.142.

	|52.~ 'Gorgon Medusa; she alone of the three Gorgons was mortal, and
was at first a beautiful maiden, but, in consequence of her having
given birth to two children by Poseidon in one of Athena's temples,
the latter changed her hair into serpents, which gave her head such
a fearful appearance that every one who looked upon it was turned into
stone' (Toynbee, ^Gorg@on). See Ovid, ^Metam.~ IV.769-803 but see the more
detailed account in Lucan, ^Phars.~ IX.624-699.  Dante may be thinking of
the particular moment in Lucan (IX.681-684) at which Athena (her role
played by Virgil in this infernal version of that drama) covers the face
of Medusa with the reptilian strands of her own hair so that Perseus
(in a role corresponding to the protagonist's, if far less violently)
can, guided by Athena's steadier hand, cut off the Gorgon's head
(IX.675-677). When Perseus rises up, escaping from the stony confines of
Libya, carrying that fearsome and blood-dripping head, Lucan refers to him
as ^aliger~ (^wing@ed), the Latin version of the poet's ^nom de famille~. For
Dante's awareness of this pun on his own family's name, Alighieri, see
the notes to ^Inf.~ XXVI.1-3; ^Purg.~ IX.28-30, X.121-129; ^Par.~ XV.81. In
this tamer version of that encounter, the hero survives, but cannot
yet be said to triumph.  The Furies' threat to bring out their biggest
defensive weapon remains unfulfilled only, we may assume, because of
the rapid deployment of God's own siege-breaker, the angelic intercessor.

	|54.~ The Furies lament that, when Theseus came to the nether regions
with Perithous in order to rescue Proserpina (see ^Aen~. VI.392-397),
they only imprisoned him, rather than putting him to death, since that
left him alive to be rescued by Hercules.

	|55-57.~ The Gorgon, or Medusa's decapitated head, was, merely looked upon,
powerful enough to turn a human onlooker to stone. Cf. the note to v. 52.

	|58-63.~ Vv. 61-63 contain the second address to the reader in the
poem (see note to ^Inf~. VIII.94-96). This one has caused more
difficulty than any other, and 'solutions' are so abundant that it is
fair to say that none has won general consent, from the first
commentators' exertions until today. (For a discussion see Amilcare
Iannucci, "Dottrina e allegoria in ^Inferno~ VIII, 67 - IX, 105," in
^Dante e le forme dell'allegoresi~, ed. M. Picone [Ravenna:
Longo, 1987], pp. 99-124.) Opinions are divided, first of all, on
whether the passage points back in the text, either primarily to Medusa
(seen as despair, heresy, the hardened will, etc.) or to the Furies
(seen as sin itself, or the three main categories of sin punished in
hell [incontinence, violence, fraud], or remorse, etc.), or to a
combination of these. Those who believe that the passage invites the
reader rather to look ^forward~ than back are in accord that it refers
to the avenging intruder who is about to appear in order to open the
locked gates of Dis; but there is great debate over exactly what the
one 'sent from heaven' (^Inf~. IX.85) signifies (see discussion in the
note to ^Inf~. IX.85). Surely it seems more natural for the reference
to point backwards to something already said. And indeed something
noteworthy and perhaps puzzling has just occurred: Virgil has covered
Dante's eye-covering hands with his own hands as well. If ^this~
passage (vv. 58-60) is the one that contains a hidden doctrine (and few
commentators believe it is, but see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969)] pp. 239-46),
perhaps what it suggests is that stoic restraint is not enough to keep
a sinner safe from dangerous temptation (i.e., Dante, had she appeared,
^would have~ looked upon Medusa and been turned to stone, just as
Ulysses ^would have~ listened to the Sirens and been destroyed by them
had he not been restrained by other forces).

	|63.~ Why are these verses 'strange'? It seems possible that
they are meant to indicate that we must abandon our habit of
reading literally, 'historically,' as we have become used to
doing once the travelers arrived in hell.  That is, we must
read these particular verses as though they were in a more usual
fiction and thus allegorize them in order to grasp their point.
Where many commentators think that this tercet offers the key
to reading the entire work 'allegorically,' others, the present
writer included, understand their reference as being local and
limited, perhaps even to vv. 58-60.

	|64-72.~ This splendidly energetic simile is perhaps built out of
elements found in two similes in the ^Aeneid~ (II.416-419 and
XII.451-455). In the first of these the Trojan forces mount an
impetuous counter-attack upon the Greek invaders of their city; in the
second the forces of Aeneas begin the eventually victorious final
attack upon the armies of Turnus. The celestial messenger, though only
one in number, has the force of a great army; victory is seconds away.

	|73.~ Now Virgil can allow Dante to use his eyes once more: Medusa is
apparently no longer a threat.

	|76-78.~ A number of commentators and translators have the frogs in
this simile going to the bottom of the pond; they go to land (^a la
terra~), as Dante says they do, and as any intelligent frog will do
when a snake enters the water. This simile probably derives from Ovid,
^Metamorphoses~ VI.370-381.

	|81.~ The angel walks upon the water in imitation of Christ (Matthew
14:25).

	|82-83.~ The angel resembles Mercury, as he is described by Statius
(^Thebaid~ II.1-11), coming back up from the foul air of the underworld
with his caduceus in hand. For a study of the various classical
sources for this scene see David Quint's article ("Epic Tradition and
^Inferno~ IX," ^Dante Studies~ 93 [1975], pp. 201-7).

	|85.~ That this agent of good is 'sent from heaven' indicates
clearly enough that he is an angel, although debate over his identity
still continues. See Silvio Pasquazi, 'Messo celeste' (ED.1971.3),
pp.  919-21, making a strong case for his angelic status and giving
a summary of the debate. Pasquazi also argues for one traditional
further identification, making the ^messo~ specifically the archangel
Michael, who led the forces of the good angels against the rebellious
ones in the war in heaven (Apoc. 12:7-9) -- see the note to ^Inf~.
VII.10-12 -- exactly the forces he now must combat once more in the
netherworld. (Pasquazi's final argument, that Michael dwells in Limbo,
is probably simply unacceptable.) Over the centuries there has been
a continuing argument between those who believe that the ^messo~ is
Mercury and those who believe that he is an angel, and, in some cases,
specifically Michael. It seems highly likely that Dante here gives us
an archangel Michael 'dressed up' as Mercury, a fused identity that is
not problematic in any way, given Dante's practice of combining pagan
and Christian materials.

For a recent discussion that again confirms the most likely hypothesis,
that this creature is indeed an angel from heaven, see Massimo
Seriacopi ("Un riscontro testuale inedito per 'dal ciel messo'
(^Inferno~ IX 85)," Publications of the Carla Rossi Academy Press
[\<a href=\"\"http://www.cra.phoenixfound.it/epubbf.htm\"\"\>http://www.cra.phoenixfound.it/epubbf.htm\</a\>], 1999).
For a return to the
central hypothesis of Pasquazi (Michael as Mercury), see Susanna Barsella
("The Mercurial ^integumentum~ of the heavenly messenger [^Inferno~
IX 79-103]," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4 [2003], pp. 371-95).

	|86-87.~ Virgil's command that Dante bow down before the angel
removes just about any doubt about the ^messo~'s divine status.

	|89-90.~ The angel's opening of the barred gates with his ^verghetta~
('wand') is almost surely, even if there is no sign of recognition in
the commentary tradition, modeled on Mercury's similar opening of the
gates of Herse's chamber with his ^verga~, i.e., his caduceus (Ovid,
^Metam~. II.819). See Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in
^Inferno~ XX," in his ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), p.
181n., and Barsella, "The Mercurial ^integumentum~ of the heavenly
messenger (^Inferno~ IX 79-103)," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4
(2003), p. 386.

	|91.~ The 'outcasts of heaven' are undoubtedly the rebellious angels
referred to in ^Inferno~ VIII.82-83, 'more than a thousand angels
fallen from Heaven.' See also the reference, a few lines earlier in
this canto (^Inf~. IX.79), to 'a thousand lost souls' who guard the
city of Dis, that is, these very angels.

	|93-99.~ The angel makes clear, in his address to his fallen
brethren, that resistance to the will of God is utterly useless. His
reference to the chaining of Cerberus by Hercules reflects ^Aeneid~
VI.392-396. Dante has now been associated with two classical heroes,
Theseus (^Inf~. IX.54) and Hercules. His powers, however, reside not
in himself but in his heaven-ordained mission.

	|100-103.~ The angel's impassive attitude tells us something about
the nature of the inhabitants of hell that we sometimes forget: from God's
perspective there is nothing worthy of attention in their plight. The
angel only wants to get out of this place as quickly as he can in order
to return to eternal bliss, so much so that he has not even a word of
greeting or support for the two travelers.

	|106.~ That Virgil and Dante now enter 'without further struggle'
helps affirm that (^Inf~. IX.33, Virgil's remark that 'now we cannot
enter without wrath,' does not refer to the warring disposition of the
travelers, but to that of the angel. This whole passage, from the last
verse of ^Inferno~ VII (^Inf~. VII.130) to now, the moment of
successful entry of the walled city of Dis, narrates a military
campaign: Virgil and Dante approach by sea in Phlegyas's military
transport ship; the forces ranged against them signal their coming and
prepare to do battle, closing the gates and assuming defensive
positions on the battlements; they wheel up their main weapons, the
Furies, who prepare to unleash their secret weapon, Medusa; the
invading forces then deploy ^their~ secret weapon, the heavenly
battering-ram that opens the gates and, in a trice, wins the battle.

	|107-111.~ The protagonist shows his usual touristic interest
in seeing the new 'sights' within this 'fortezza.' The word the poet
chooses reminds us that we here behold a different aspect of hell. Once we
see the even more imposing structures awaiting the travelers (Malebolge
and the walled city of Cocytus), we have some sense of the import of the
first 'built environment' of hell that we experience after that imposing
gate described in the third canto, a sign that the sins punished within
it are more offensive to God than those above.

	|112-115.~ Dante's references to two famous ancient Roman cemeteries,
at Arles in France and Pola in Istria, build the scene for us: these
grave sites are not mounds in the ground but sarchophagi, raised
monuments of stone that contain the remains of the dead.

	|118-123.~ We will eventually be apprised of the heretical nature
of the beliefs of the inhabitants of these tombs, whom we can hear but
cannot see. We will have a similar experience when we look upon the
flames of the false counselors in cantos XXVI and XXVII, also unseen in
their flames, yet entirely audible.  And see the note to ^Inf.~ XIX.25,
for discussion of the parodic inversion of Pentecostal fire in the
punishment of sins that involve the perversion of the gift of the Holy
Spirit.  One thinks of these heretics, the sodomites (cantos XV and XVI),
and the false counselors.  All these three ^loci~ contain sinners who use
their intelligence in such ways as to beguile others into believing what
they should not believe.

	|127-131.~ Virgil explains to Dante that this sixth Circle of hell
encloses many different heretical sects, each of which is punished in a
separate sepulchre, and some of which are punished with more, others
with less, severity.

	Why is heresy punished within the walls of Dis, where all the sins
punished are sins of will, not those of appetite? It is interesting to
see how often early commentators associate heresy with obstinacy or
obduracy; their word is the Latin ^pertinax~. Some of them may be
reflecting St. Thomas's definition (^S.T~. II-II, q. 5, a. 3): if a man
'is not ^pertinacious~ in his disbelief, he is in that case no heretic,
but only a man in error.' See, among others, the commentaries of
Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.127 and to ^Inf~. IX.110-133), Benvenuto
(comm. to ^Inf~. IX.112-116 and to ^Inf~. IX.127-129), Francesco da
Buti (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.106-123 and to ^Inf~. X.31-39), John of
Serravalle (comm. to ^Inf~. X.13-15); Daniello (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.133
[citing Thomas]) and, among the moderns, Poletto (comm. to ^Inf~.
X.28-30), Carroll (comm. to ^Inf~. IX.132).

	|132.~ The turnings to the right here and at ^Inferno~ XVII.32 have
caused puzzlement and some ingenuity. In hell, whenever the direction
of their movement is mentioned, Dante and Virgil elsewhere always head
to the left. Only on these two occasions do they move rightward.
These two rightward turnings occur just before the entrance to the
sixth Circle, in which heresy is punished, and before the exit from the
realm of Violence, the seventh Circle. Some have welcomed the
Scartazzini/Vandelli hypothesis (see that commentary to this passage)
that both heresy and fraud are alike in their deformations of truth.
But this explanation fails to observe that treachery, punished in the
ninth and last Circle, also deforms the truth, and that the second
rightward turning takes place ^before~ the travelers enter the realm of
fraud, in any case. Other less simple explanations have other
difficulties associated with them. This is another instance in which
the commentary tradition has not resolved Dante's plan, if indeed there
was one. It is possible that the rightward movement at ^Inferno~
XVII.32 is only the necessary result of having to leave their circling
movement in order to move toward Geryon, even if some maintain (e.g.,
Rossetti [comm. to ^Inf~. XVII.31-33]) that there is an allegorical
meaning both in turning to the right to face fraud from 'the right
side,' as it were, and in walking ten steps that reflect the ten
^bolge~ of Fraud. In any case, either of these explanations reduces
the likelihood that there is a 'program' linking ^Inferno~ IX.132 and
XVII.32. And then the only 'program' would be one involving the sin of
heresy. For some reason Dante decided that its specialness, or perhaps
extraneousness to the Aristotelian/Ciceronian divisions of vice, called
for the retrograde and special movement. But for a literal explanation
of even this turning to the right, see Andreoli (comm. to ^Inf~.
IX.132): 'Di cosiffatta eccezione io credo non si possa dare altra
ragione che questa, che avendo dovuto i Poeti fare una grande aggirata
(c. VIII, 79) per isbarcare alla porta di Dite, nell'entrarvi poi si
trovassero aver gi@a percorso pi@u della solita nona parte del
cerchio; e che perci@o questa volta, per trovare il punto prefisso
alla loro traversata nel cerchio seguente, essi invece di procedere a
sinistra avessero dovuto retrocedere a destra.' And see the note to
^Inf.~ XVII.28-33.

	|133.~ For the logistics of this little scene, see Chiavacci Leonardi
(comm. ^ad loc.~): '^li alti spaldi~: le alte mura di difesa della citt@a;
^spaldi~ erano propriamente i ballatoi che correvano in cima alle mura;
qui per sineddoche indicano genericamente le mura. Dante e Virgilio
camminano quindi, come si dir@a in X 2, nello stretto spazio di terreno
tra le mura e le tombe.'
