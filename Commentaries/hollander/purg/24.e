	|1-3.~  The conversation between Forese and Dante continues.  We have
not heard Virgil's voice since the fifteenth verse of the last canto.
We will not hear it again until the next canto (XXV.17).  This is his
longest silence since he entered the poem in its first canto (see the
note to ^Inf~. XXX.37-41).  He would seem to have been moved aside in
response to Dante's interest in the encounter with Forese and concern
with exploring the nature of his own most particular poetic practice,
the subject at the core of this canto.

	|4.~  For the phrase 'things dead twice over' see the Epistle of Jude.
The context is worth noting.  Jude is declaiming against those who
have infiltrated the ranks of the true believers, those 'ungodly men'
(^homines... impii~ -- Jude 4) who are compared to, in succession, the
unbelieving Israelites, the fallen angels, the sinners of Sodom and
Gomorrah, as well as those great sinners Cain, Balaam (Numbers 22-25
and 31:16), and Korah (Numbers 16).  The presence of these ungodly ones
is then portrayed (Jude 12) as a blemish upon the feasts of Christians
gathered in charity.  Interlopers, they are described as 'feeding
themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about
by the winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead
(^bis mortuae~), plucked out by the roots.'  Several commentators refer
to this passage, but only Poletto (comm. to vv. 4-6) does so with some
attention to the context, also graciously giving credit to the
commentary of Antonio Cesari (^Bellezze della "Divina Commedia"~
[Verona: P. Libanti, 1824-26]) for the earliest citation.  The
^contrapasso~ here is thus more related to gluttony than at first may
seem apparent, calling attention to an arid feasting that has no regard
for the condition of the soul.  These penitents thus purge themselves
as though in memory of Jude's gluttonous 'ungodly men.'

	|8-9.~  Once again (see the note to ^Purg~. XXI.103-114) we see that
Statius is portrayed as putting off his Christian zeal in order to give
himself to affectionate admiration of Virgil.

	|10.~  Dante asks after Forese's sister, Piccarda, whom we shall meet
as the first presence of ^Paradiso~ (see the note to ^Par~. III.46-49).
The Donati family, like others in the poem, is variously dispersed in
the afterworld.  Later in this canto (verse 84) we will hear of
Forese's brother, Corso, who is destined for hell.  In ante-purgatory
we met a member of another similarly dispersed family, Buonconte da
Montefeltro (^Purg~. V.88), son of the damned Guido (^Inf~. XXVII.67).

	|13-15.~  Forese's touching words of praise for his sister, already
joyous in the presence of God in the Empyrean (the Christian version of
Mt. Olympus, home of the gods in classical mythology) brought the
following misogynist comment from Benvenuto (comm. to these verses):
'And that is great praise, for it is a rare thing to find in the same
woman harmony between comely form and chaste behavior.'

	Piccarda, who was dragged from her life as a nun into matrimony
against her will, eventually puts us in mind of Pia de' Tolomei
(^Purg~. V.133-136), who also was forced into a marriage she did not
welcome.  And both of them may send our thoughts back to Francesca da
Rimini, similarly mistreated (^Inf~. V.100-107).  The first three women
present in each of the three ^cantiche~ have this experience in common.
The damned Francesca insists on the impending damnation of her
husband, Gianciotto (but see the note to ^Inf~. V.107), while Forese,
on the way to salvation, speaks glowingly of his already saved sister.

	|16-18.~  'Here' surely refers to this terrace (see the note to
^Purg~. XXII.49-51).  Since there is no prohibition of naming names on
any other terrace, commentators worry about Forese's motive in speaking
this way.  Most currently agree that he is using exaggerated
understatement (the trope ^litotes~) to make his point: i.e., on this
terrace one ^must~ use names to identify the penitents because they are
unrecognizable (as was Forese to Dante at ^Purg~. XXIII.43-48) as a
result of their emaciation.

	|19-20.~  Bonagiunta Orbicciani degli Overardi da Lucca (1220?-1297?),
notary and writer of lyric poems, composed mainly in imitation of the
Proven$cal poets.  He was involved in polemic against the poetry of
Guido Guinizzelli and was attacked by Dante in his treatise on
vernacular eloquence (^Dve~ I.xiii.1) for writing in a dialectical
rather than the lofty ('curial') vernacular.  Some three dozen of his
poems survive and a group of these have been re-edited and re-presented
by Gianfranco Contini (editor, ^Poeti del Duecento~, 2 vols.
[Milan-Naples: Ricciardi, 1960], vol. I, pp. 257-82).  See Claudio
Giunta (^La poesia italiana nell'et@a di Dante: la linea
Bonagiunta-Guinizzelli~ [Bologna: Il Mulino, 1998]) and Carlo Paolazzi
(^La maniera mutata: Il "dolce stil novo" tra Scrittura e "Ars
poetica"~ [Milan: ^Vita e Pensiero~, Pubblicazioni dell'Universit@a
Cattolica, 1998]) for the poetic relationship between Bonagiunta and
Guinizzelli and its significance for Dante.

	|21-24.~  Simon de Brie, who 'married' Holy Church as Pope Martin IV
(1281-85), was French.  He was not born in Tours, but had served as
treasurer of the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours.  He briefly served
as chancellor of France before becoming a cardinal in 1261.  And his
French connection was further apparent when Charles of Anjou was
instrumental in securing the papacy for him.  His gluttonous affection
for eels from Lake Bolsena caused him, according to Jacopo della Lana
(comm. to vv. 19-24), to have them, still alive, drowned in white wine
from Liguria (the town of Vernazza) and then roasted.  The commentator
also reports that, as pope, coming from meetings dealing with Church
business he would cry out, 'O Lord God, how many ills must we bear for
Your holy Church!  Let us have a drink!' and head for table to console
himself.

	Not only did this gluttonous pope support French political designs in
Italy, he was the man who promoted Benedetto Caetani to the rank of
cardinal, thus greatly facilitating his eventual elevation as Pope
Boniface VIII (a promotion that Dante could not have regarded with
equanimity, given his personal sufferings at the hands of this pope
[see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.52-53]).  In the light of such things, why
did Dante decide that Martin was among the saved?  Trucchi (comm. to
vv. 19-24) suggests that, as the successor to the nepotistic and venal
Nicholas III (see ^Inf~. XIX.69-72), Martin put an end, for a time, to
the practice of simony in the papacy.  It is for that reason, in his
opinion, that Dante overlooked his other flagrant sins to save him.

	|26-27.~  The act of naming being particularly necessary on this
terrace (see the note to vv. 16-18), it brings pleasure (Dante again
employs ^litotes~: it does not cause scowls) to those who are named and
thus may hope for relieving prayer from the world, once Dante returns
to it.  It hardly needs to be pointed out that many of the sinners in
hell were less pleased at being recognized.

	|29.~  'Ubaldino degli Ubaldini of La Pila (castle in the Mugello, or
upper valley of the Sieve, tributary of the Arno, north of Florence),
member of the powerful Ghibelline family of that name.  Ubaldino, who
was one of those who voted for the destruction of Florence (^Inf~.
X.92), and was a member of the Consiglio Generale, after the battle of
Montaperti (Sept. 4, 1260), was brother of the famous Cardinal
Ottaviano degli Ubaldini (^Inf~. X.120), uncle of Ugolino d'Azzo
(^Purg~. XIV.105), and father of the Archbishop Ruggieri of Pisa
(^Inf~. XXXIII.14); he died in 1291' (Toynbee, "Pila, Ubaldin dalla"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|29-30.~  Bonifazio has been 'identified by modern commentators with
Bonifazio dei Fieschi of Genoa, Archbishop of Ravenna, 1274-1295....
The ancient pastoral staff of the Archbishops of Ravenna, which is
still preserved, bears at the top an ornament shaped like a chess
"rook" [rather than the conventional curved crosier], hence the term
^rocco~ used by Dante.  Bonifazio... is known to have been immensely
wealthy, but there is no record of his having been addicted to
gluttony' (Toynbee, "Bonifazio[2]" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	While some debate whether or not the reference to the archbishop's
pastoral care is meant to be taken ironically, it seems difficult, in
light of the descriptions of the other penitent gluttons, to take it
any other way.  The flock he is envisioned as leading would seem to be
less the faithful of Ravenna than his guests to dinner.

	|31-33.~  'Marchese (or Marchesino) degli Orgogliosi of Forl@i...
was Podest@a of Faenza in 1296' (Toynbee, "Marchese[4]" [^Concise
Dante Dictionary~]).  Embellishing an incident he probably first heard
from his teacher, Benvenuto da Imola, John of Serravalle (comm. to
these verses) recounts it this way: 'One day [Marchese] asked of his
servant, "What do the people say of me?  What is my reputation among
them?"  And the servant answered, "O my lord, they say that you are
noble and wise," etc.  And so he spoke again to his servant, saying,
"Now tell me the truth, what do they really say?"  In reply the servant
said, "Since you wish it, I will tell you the truth; people say you are
a great drinker of wine."  At which [Marchese] responded, "These people
speak truthfully; but they really ought to add that I am always thirsty
-- and that is a fact, for I thirst continually."'  Bonagiunta was also
a lover of the grape, according to Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 34-39), who
characterised him as 'a deft contriver of rhymes and a ready imbiber of
wines.'

	|34-36.~  Dante's attention was drawn to Bonagiunta da Lucca because,
he says, Bonagiunta seemed to know him.  We may reflect that Dante the
poet's interest in Bonagiunta centered in his desire to stage, clued by
the utterance of this lesser poet, his own ^ars poetica~, as we shall
shortly understand.  Including Dante, the interaction among those
speaking or being noticed in this canto involves two poets, two
religious figures, and two politicians.  And then there are the two
classical poets who are not even mentioned once in this very 'modern'
canto (it is notable that Pope Martin, dead only fifteen years, is the
senior ghost among the five gluttons is this group).

	|37-39.~  For Dante's use of the verb ^mormorare~ (murmur), see the
note to ^Purgatorio~ X.100-102.  This passage has long been
problematic.  Does Bonagiunta refer to his fellow Lucchesi in an
unfavorable way, calling them ^gentucca~ or ^gentuccia~ (a deprecating
way of referring to his people, or ^gente~)?  Or is he mentioning a
kindly woman of that name who will be welcoming to Dante when, in his
exile, he will come to Lucca?  In this case he would be referring to
the ^femmina~ referred to in vv. 43-45.  Beginning with Francesco da
Buti (comm. to vv. 28-39), who states that Gentucca was the name of a
woman from Rossimpelo, most commentators believe that the reference is
to someone who was benevolent to Dante in Lucca during a stay there.
We have, however, no confirming evidence for this sojourn in Lucca (see
Michele Messina, "Lucca" [ED.1971.3]), which, if it took place,
probably did so in 1308-9, and certainly no hard facts establishing her
identity.  Nonetheless, this remains the best hypothesis.  Still others
have attempted to make a case for Gentucca as a woman with whom Dante
had some sort of sexual liaison, an interpretation that seems
venturesome at best.  On the entire question see Giorgio Varanini,
"Gentucca" (ED.1971.3).  For more recent consideration of the question,
see Cono Mangieri ("Gentucca dantesca e dintorni," ^Italian Quarterly~
125-126 [1995], pp. 5-25), arguing, in a bold hypothesis, that Gentucca
was an illegitimate daughter of the poet.

	|40-42.~  Dante encourages Bonagiunta, for whom speech is made
difficult by the pain he feels in his mouth, the orifice by which he
offended in gluttony, to speak more plainly.

	|43-48.~  If this woman is, as some contemporary students of the
question suggest, Gentucca di Ciucchino Morla, she was the wife of
Buonaccorso Fondora.  In that case she wore the black wimple, worn by
wives, not the white, reserved for widows.  Nino Visconti's widow,
Giovanna, according to him, made the mistake of remarrying badly,
putting off the white wimple (^Purg~. VIII.74).  However, we cannot be
sure whether Bonagiunta is referring to an as yet unmarried woman, or
to a married one whose husband, soon to die, is still alive.  In any
case, this woman will make Lucca seem pleasant to Dante, no matter how
others may blame it (as Dante himself had done in ^Inf~. XXI.40-42).

	|49-51.~  Having recognized Dante earlier (vv. 35-36), Bonagiunta now
presses him about the nature of his poetry.  Is he the poet who drew
forth from within himself the new poems that began with the ^canzone~
'Ladies that have intelligence of love'?  This is the first long poem
of the three that help to give structure to the ^Vita nuova~,
announcing the beginning of its second stage, in which Dante chooses to
give over the style of 'complaint,' borrowed from Cavalcanti, in order
to turn to the style of praise, with its debt to Guinizzelli.  Dante
composed this poem around 1289.  From this remark, we learn at least
one important thing.  Whatever the determining features of Dante's new
poetry, it was different -- at least according to him, using Bonagiunta
as his mouthpiece -- from ^all~ poetry written before it, including
Dante's own.  This precision evades many who discuss the problem, who
continue to allow poems by Dante and other poets written before ^Donne
ch'avete~ to share its status.  It seems clear that Dante's absolute
and precise purpose is to rewrite the history of Italian lyric,
including that of his own poems, so that it fits his current program.

	|52-54.~  There is perhaps no more debated tercet in this poem than
this one, and perhaps none that has more far-reaching implications for
our general understanding of Dante's stance as a poet.  Does he refer
to Amore as the god of Love? or as the name of the true God in His
Third Person, the Holy Spirit?  Dantists are deeply (and fiercely)
divided by this issue.  The bibliography of work devoted to it is
immense.  Readers with Italian will want to refer to three papers that
were composed for the Third International Dante Seminar (Florence,
2000) by members of the panel concerning the currently vexed question
of Dante's attitude toward Cavalcanti and its relationship to his view
of his own poetic as this is given voice here (see three contributions
to the volume ^Dante: da Firenze all'aldil@a.  Atti del terzo
Seminario dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2001]: Roberto Antonelli, "Cavalcanti e Dante: al di qua del
Paradiso," pp. 289-302; Robert Durling, "'Mio figlio ov'@e?'
[^Inferno~ X, 60]," pp. 303-29; and Lino Leonardi, "Cavalcanti, Dante e
il nuovo stile," pp. 331-54).  For the views of this writer, which are
at some variance especially from those of the first and third of these,
see Hollander ("Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992],
pp. 201-31, and "Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the ^Comedy~," in
^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario dantesco
internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence: Cesati,
1999],  pp. 263-81).  In the most recent of these two studies, the case
is made for our understanding that Dante indeed presents himself as
writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, a view that causes
understandable distress, but which is fundamental, in one line of
thought, to a better comprehension of his purposes.  Similar views are
to be found in Selene Sarteschi ("^Purgatorio~ XXIV 49-53: Dante e il
'Dolce stil novo'.  Verifica di una continuit@a ideologica," in her
^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002
(1995)]), pp. 97-137.  For a curious blending of (1) an old and (2) a
new view, see Carlo Paolazzi (^La maniera mutata: Il "dolce stil novo"
tra Scrittura e "Ars poetica"~ [Milan: ^Vita e Pensiero~, Pubblicazioni
dell'Universit@a Cattolica, 1998]), who attempts (1) to resuscitate
an actual 'school' of ^stilnovisti~, including the major figures
Guinizzelli, Cavalcanti, Dante, and Cino da Pistoia, all of whom are
related, according to Paolazzi, by (2) significant borrowings from
concepts found in Horace's ^Ars poetica~ and from the language of
Scripture.  A major impediment to accepting such a view is the fact
that Dante's text explicitly and without possible exception (unless one
were to argue that Bonagiunta simply does not know whereof he speaks --
a difficult position to support) says that the ^dolce stil novo~ began
with 'Donne ch'avete,' ca. 1289, thus omitting at least Guinizzelli
from 'membership.'  In addition, Dante's treatment of Cavalcanti in the
^Comedy~ makes any such evaluation more than merely dubious, as Danilo
Bonanno agrees (^La perdita e il ritorno. Presenze cavalcantiane
nell'ultimo Dante~ [Pisa: Edizioni ETS, 1999]), pp. 50-52.  On the
other hand, that Dante and Cino were, according to Dante, fellow
'stilnovisti' seems more than likely.  For an attempt to make the
school even more inclusive than a surely questionable Romantic view had
done, see Gorni ("Paralipomeni a Lippo," ^Studi di filologia italiana~
47 [1989]), pp. 27-29; in a similar inclusive vein see Pasquini (^Dante
e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno
Mondadori, 2001]), pp. 33-36.  The cause of much of the problem as it
is misconstrued by Dante's critics is that they try to establish what
really happened in the history of Italian poetry, while Dante himself
puts forward only what he decided had really happened.

	|55-63.~  Bonagiunta's response may be paraphrased as follows: 'Now I
understand the nature of the knot that held back the Notary [Giacomo da
Lentini], Guittone [d'Arezzo], and me from the sweet new style that at
this very moment I am hearing!  Now I clearly understand how your pens
[plural] followed strictly after the words of the "dictator," something
that ours did not; and in that lies the entire difference between your
[Dante's] "new style" and ours.'  He falls silent, as though, it seems,
satisfied with his utterance.

	What exactly does Dante mean by the phrase 'sweet new style'?  This is
surely one of the key questions presented in the poem, and not one of
the easiest.  Further, who else wrote in that 'style'?  And what is the
significance of the fact that Bonagiunta says that he hears it ^now~
(in listening to Dante here in purgatory? in current Tuscan poems
composed on earth? [but how would he ^hear~ these?])?  What follows is
a series of hypotheses that sketch out this writer's views of the major
aspects of a difficult question.

	(1) The passage, probably written ca. 1311-12, marks the first time
that the beguiling phrase 'dolce stil novo' had ever been used in the
vernacular that we call 'Italian.'  That it was meant to refer to or to
identify an actual 'school' of poets that existed before the date of
its inscription in Dante's text may not be assumed (see Emilio Bigi
["Genesi di un concetto storiografico: 'dolce stil novo,'" ^Giornale
storico della letteratura italiana~ 132 (1955), pp. 333-71] and Guido
Favati [^Inchiesta sul Dolce Stil Nuovo~ (Florence: Le Monnier,1975)],
although it frequently is.

	(2) On the other hand, the author's (or Bonagiunta's) plural 'vostre'
should be seen as including not only himself, but also Cino da Pistoia
(the one fellow poet who Dante believed had understood the theological
significance of his Beatrice), if perhaps no one else (see Hollander
["Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 (1992), pp. 201-31]
and Furio Brugnolo ["Cino (e Onesto) dentro e fuori la ^Commedia~," in
^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo (Padua:
Editoriale Programma, 1993), pp. 369-86]).  For reasons to believe that
Cino himself, as evidenced in his poem of tribute, 'Su per la costa,'
written after Dante's death, believed that Dante's plurality of ^penne~
included him, see Luciano Rossi ("Il ^nodo~ di Bonagiunta e le ^penne~
degli stilnovisti: ancora sul XXIV del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Fictio
poetica: Studi italiani e ispanici in onore di Georges G,untert~, ed.
Katherina Maier-Troxler and Costantino Maeder [Florence: Cesati,
1998]), pp. 49-50.

	(3) The significance of the poetic stance struck in the phrase should
be understood in theological terms.  Dante is not presenting himself as
a usual love poet, but as one who serves as God's scribe in recording
the result of God's love for him through the agency of Beatrice.
Benvenuto, so insensitive (and even hostile) to Dante's claims for a
theological basis for his writing, has a wonderfully angry gloss to vv.
52-54: 'inspires me': you should not understand: with the love of
divine grace, ^as certain people falsely interpret~ (italics added),
but indeed with lascivious love.'  It is interesting that Benvenuto
feels he must oppose those who are reading the poem theologically in
his own day.  We do not have any record of such an understanding of
these lines; it is heartening to know that it existed.  John of
Serravalle (comm. to verse 58) follows his master in thinking Amor here
is but the 'god' presiding over the world's oldest indoor sport.  Dante
and others had previously written in a 'sweet' style; but only he, now,
in his ^Comedy~, writes in this 'sweet new style' that creates a
theologized poetry that is like almost no one else's (see Mazzotta
[^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1979)], pp. 197-210; Zygmunt Baranski ["Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
(Florence: Cesati, 2001)]), pp. 392-94.

	(4) The word 'style' here has a broader connotation than it usually
does in discourse about poetry, indicating not only a way of writing,
but a subject for writing, as was apparent when his new style of praise
in ^Vita nuova~ was presented as requiring new 'matter' (see Hollander,
"Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the ^Comedy~," in ^Dante: mito e poesia.
Atti del secondo Seminario dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and
T. Crivelli [Florence: Cesati, 1999],  pp. 271-72; Aversano ["Sulla
poetica dantesca nel canto XXIV del ^Purgatorio~," ^L'Alighieri~ 16
(2000)], p. 131: the poem is 'sweet artistically because it is new
poetically.')  The 'new style' not only sounds different, it ^is~
different (but see the differing view of Lino Leonardi ["Cavalcanti,
Dante e il nuovo stile," in ^Dante: da Firenze all'aldil@a.  Atti
del terzo Seminario dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone
(Florence: Cesati, 2001)]), p. 334.  The very phrasing of the element
that sets, in Bonagiunta's understanding (vv. 58-59), this 'style'
apart from all others -- copying out exactly what was spoken by the
'dictator' -- points not at all to style, but rather to content.

	(5) We should probably also understand that the phrase 'dolce stil
novo' refers to some of Dante's earlier poetry (only the ^canzone~
'Donne ch'avete intelletto d'amore' for certain), some of Cino's poems
(at least and perhaps only the ^canzone~ upon the death of Beatrice,
'Avegna ched el m'aggia pi@u per tempo'), and to Dante's ^Comedy~,
thus presenting the author's claims for a theological grounding of his
poem's inspiration as being joined to certain of his earlier poems that
he felt either had, or could be construed as having, the same
character.  This is the crux of a continuing disagreement with those
who argue that the ^Comedy~ is a poem that goes ^beyond~ the ^stil
novo~ (e.g., Pertile ["Dante's ^Comedy~: Beyond the ^Stilnovo~,"
^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~ 13 (1993), pp. 47-77] or Malato [^Dante~
(Rome: Salerno, 1999)], pp. 105-22), rather than being a continuation
of it.  While privileging a theological reading (if not firmly), Warren
Ginsberg (^Dante's Aesthetics of Being~ [Ann Arbor: University of
Michigan Press, 1999)]), p. 88, like Pertile, is of the opinion that
the ^Comedy~'s style 'is a new style, which differs from the ^stil
novo~.'  In short, while Dante and others (Guido Cavalcanti perhaps the
most capable among them) had previously written in a 'sweet' style,
Dante alone developed, on the model of Guinizzelli's lyrics, poems of
praise of a theologized lady, Beatrice (see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.112).
For discussion of a
specifically Christian reformulation of traditional images of the god
of Love in the fourth stanza of the poem that Dante authorizes us to
think of as the first poem of the 'sweet new style,' see Vincent Moleta
("'Voi le vedete Amor pinto nel viso' [^V.N.~, XIX, 12]: The Roots of
Dante's Metaphor," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992], pp. 57-75).  For a
review of the entire question of Dante's relations with Guido and of
the debate over their nature, see Enrico Fenzi (^La canzone d'amore di
Guido Cavalcanti e i suoi antichi commenti~ [Genoa: il Melangolo,
1999], pp. 9-70).  See also Enrico Malato (^Dante e Guido Cavalcanti: il
dissidio per la "Vita nuova" e il <disdegno> di Guido~ [Rome: Salerno,

polemica," ^Rassegna europea di letteratura italiana~ 15 [2000], pp.
9-35).

	|56.~  In a single line Bonagiunta crosses off the list of illustrious
precursors two of the great poetic figures that preceded Dante, Giacomo
da Lentini (died ca. 1250) and Guittone d'Arezzo (ca. 1230-94).
Giacomo was the first major Italian practitioner of lyric, and is
looked upon as the inventor of the sonnet and as the founder of the
so-called Sicilian School, the first group of writers of lyric in
Italian, taking their models from the writers of lyric in Proven$cal.
Dante is later still harder on Guittone (see ^Purg~. XXVI.124-126 and
note), who, as Dante came to poetry in the 1280s, was perhaps the
pre-eminent Tuscan poet.

	|61-62.~   Letterio Cassata ("Un'ipotesi per ^Pg~ 24, 61-62," ^Critica
del testo~ 4 [2001]), p. 307, paraphrases these lines as follows: 'e
chi vuole accingersi a procedere pi@u in l@a non @e
pi@u in grado di vedere il divario dall'uno all'altro stile' (and
he who would prepare himself to go more deeply into the matter is no
longer in a position to distinguish the difference between the one
style and the other).  It is a difficult text to be sure of.

	|64-74.~  The two similes, piled one upon the other, return to a
technique not observed in some time: a comparison based on an antique
source coupled with a completely 'vernacular' and 'ordinary' one.  See
^Inferno~ XXIV.1-15, where ancient and contemporary elements are
combined in a single simile, and ^Inferno~ XXVI.25-39, where local
Tuscan agriculture and Elijah's ascent to heaven are the contrasting
elements in two neighboring similes.

	The first of this pair derives, fairly obviously to today's reader,
instructed by the notes in the text, from Lucan (^Phars~. V.711-716), a
description of cranes fleeing winter's cold to winter on the Nile.
Nonetheless, for all the certainty in recent commentators that this is
a reminiscence of Lucan, it was only with Torraca (comm. to vv. 73-75)
that it seems first to have been observed.  Lucan's passage is
revisited even more plainly at ^Paradiso~ XVIII.73-78.

	|75.~  Forese's remark is perhaps the high point in the fraternal
affection found in purgatory, as he looks forward to Dante's death as
the necessary precondition for their next meeting in the afterlife.

	|76-81.~  Notable is Dante's calm assurance that he will be saved.
This may seem prideful, but is rather the natural result, or so he
would have us believe, of his having been chosen for such an experience
of the afterworld.  God, he would ask us to imagine, would not have
selected as His scribe one destined to die in sin.

	Porena (comm. to vv. 79-81) suggests that the world-weary tone of the
protagonist reflects less the Dante of the year 1300, at the peak of
his political success, than the exiled poet of ca. 1310 (the date that
Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 77-78] suggest for the composition of this
part of the poem).

	|82-90.~  Corso Donati, brother of Forese, was, in Dante's eyes, the
Black Guelph who bore 'the greatest blame' for Florence's problems (and
for his own) because of his alliance with Pope Boniface VIII, the
'beast' who will drag him to hell -- as Dante will see before much time
passes.  In fact, through the magic of post-event prophecy (Corso was
killed on 6 October 1308), Forese is able to promise the protagonist
this happy vengeance.

	Corso had supervised the murderous taking of the city by the Black
Guelphs after Charles of Valois had led his French troops into Florence
in November 1301.  In a political reversal that is not totally unlike
Dante's own, he was condemned to death by the priors for trying to take
power into his own hands in a supposed arrangement involving the Tuscan
Ghibelline leader Uguccione della Faggiuola, to whose daughter he was
married.

	While the 'beast' in Forese's account is clearly metaphorical, Corso
apparently did die while trying to escape, either in a fall from his
horse or by being lanced by one of his captors once he had fallen -- or
even as he was hanging from a stirrup, dragged along the ground.

	|94-99.~  The military simile fits the tone of the death scene of
Corso that has just been narrated by his brother.  Here, by way of
returning to the rigors of his penance, Forese is allowed to assume the
role of the cavalryman who goes out to make the first contact of
battle.  Virgil and Statius, described by a word perhaps never seen
before in Italian, 'marshals,' are left behind, but are calmly
directing the battle, as it were.  As for Dante, that retired
cavalryman (see the note to ^Inf~. XXI.95), it is not clear what role
he plays, but he is a subordinate to these two marshals, those great
poets who led other humans into knowledge and virtue through their
works.

	|100-102.~ Forese has moved quickly along the terrace,
far ahead of Dante, Virgil, and Statius. The protagonist's eyes remain
fixed on Forese's departing form, as his thoughts remain fixed on his
riddling prophesy (vv. 82-87).

	|103-105.~  Moving along the terrace with his eyes fixed on Forese,
Dante does not at first see the tree that his own movement forward has
brought him to.  The second tree of this terrace has caused less
puzzlement than the first one (^Purg~. XXII.131-135); the succeeding
verses (116-117) answer most questions that one might have (see the
note to vv. 115-117): this tree is an offshoot of the Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil.

	Adolfo Jenni ("Il Canto XXIII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove letture
dantesche~, vol. V [Florence: Le Monnier, 1972)]), pp. 12-13, argues
that the sight of the water from above causing the leaves to shine
makes the penitent gluttons even hungrier.  As was the case with the
first tree, this one is also apparently watered from above (see ^Purg~.
XXII.137-138).

	|106-111.~  This simile possibly reflects a passage from ^Convivio~
(^Conv~. IV.xii.16) in which Dante speaks of the natural love of human
souls for God, their maker, which is easily drawn off course: 'Thus we
see little children setting their desire first of all on an apple, and
then, growing older, desiring to possess a little bird, and then still
later desiring to possess fine clothes, then a horse, and then a woman,
and then modest wealth, then greater riches, and then still more' (tr.
Lansing).  The central elements of this image (a man catching the
hungry attention of a child by holding up an apple) are deployed again
in ^Purgatorio~ XXVII.45.

	|112-114.~  The penitents (as will be the poets) are urged to turn
aside, apparently by the same voice from within the tree that will warn
off the poets (and since the names of exemplary figures are recited by
this voice, we probably correctly assume it speaks to all, triggered by
its sense that someone is approaching, that is, not only in response to
these special visitors).  They are 'enlightened' (in the sense that
their first opinion, that the fruit of this tree is desirable, is
changed) when they realize that this tree is a branch from that beneath
which humankind first fell into sin, and thus willingly move away.

	|115-117.~  Once again an unseen and unidentified divinely authorized
voice speaks from within the foliage of a tree (see ^Purg~.
XXII.140-154).  This is an offshoot of the tree of which Eve (and then
Adam, who had also been warned not to [see the note to ^Purg~.
XXII.140-141]) ate the fruit.  Benvenuto's gloss (to vv. 115-120) is
admirable: this act of 'gluttony' is seen as the first sin, even though
Adam himself will later (^Par~. XXVI.115-117) be clear that its cause
was not really appetite for food but the desire to trespass for its own
sake (as St. Augustine understood in his later redoing of the scene in
his recounting of his youthful escapade involving the theft of a
farmer's pears [^Confessions~ II.iv: 'our real pleasure was in doing
something forbidden' -- tr. Pine-Coffin]): the first disobedience is
thus the very desire to disobey (see ^Par~. XXIX.55-57 for Satan's
pride as the primal sin).  Benvenuto is more alert to Dante's strategy
here than many a more recent commentator,  understanding that the image
of eating is germane to Dante's description of Gluttony, despite the
larger theological meaning of the primal act of sin.

	Porena (comm. to vv. 116-117) is one of those who unaccountably
believe that there must be still other trees upon this terrace.  If,
indeed, Dante is referring to the two most significant trees in the
original garden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
and Evil (Genesis 2:8), it would seem to be unlikely that he would have
wanted us to imagine there might be others scattered along the terrace.
Porena denies that the first speaking tree (^Purg~. XXII.141) is an
offshoot of the Tree of Life, but believes that it, too, is derived
from the Tree of Knowledge, an opinion that may seem difficult to
justify.

	Bosco/Reggio raise a question in their commentary (to verse 115):  Why
was the first tree (^Purg~. XXII.139) approachable, while this one is
not?  Would it not seem reasonable that the fruit of the Tree of Life
should be precisely what purgation is preparing penitents to receive?
At the same time, it would also seem reasonable that they should
prepare for their reward by ceremonially avoiding the site of
humanity's original sin.

	|121-126.~  The voice reminds the travelers (and the penitents, we
assume) first of the 'Centaurs, mythical race, half horses and half
men, said to have been offspring of Ixion, King of the Lapithae, and a
cloud in the shape of Hera [Juno]' (Toynbee, "Centauri" [^Concise Dante
Dictionary~]).  The Centaurs fought with the Lapiths and Theseus at the
wedding feast for Piritho,us (the friend of Theseus and their
half-brother) and his bride Hippodamia.  The Centaurs attempt to rape
the bride and bridesmaids but are prevented by Theseus and others.  The
final 300 lines of the scene, which served as Dante's source, in Ovid
(^Metam~. XII.210-535) represent a kind of tumultuous and comic redoing
of the battle scenes in the ^Iliad~ (and in the ^Aeneid~), with plenty
of body parts and blood.

	For the double nature of the Centaurs (beast and man at once), see
^Inferno~ XII.84.

	The Hebrews selected by Gideon to make war upon the Midianites were
those who lifted water to their mouths in their cupped hands, as
opposed to those who cast themselves down to a stream to drink directly
with their mouths (see Judges 7:2-8).  The ones remembered here are not
the three hundred whom he chose to fight, but the 9,700 who were sent
back to their tents.  These were 'slack' in that they gave in totally
to their desire to drink, while the 300 displayed a more controlled
demeanor, more fitting to those who would require composure even in the
heat of battle.

	|133-134.~  This voice, we shortly come to understand, comes from the
angel of Temperance.

	|137-138.~  Singleton (comm. to vv. 137-139) points out that the
description of this angel is indebted to John's Revelation (Apoc.
1:9-20).  The passage, prologue to John's vision, tells how the apostle
was ordered to write it by Jesus, a scene described in terms that at
times closely resemble these.

	|145-150.~  The last of the similes in a canto rich with them compares
the waft of air from the angel's wing felt by Dante on his brow to the
sweet-smelling breeze of May.  Tommaseo (general note to this canto)
suggested a source in Virgil's fourth ^Georgic~ (IV.415): 'Haec ait et
liquidum ambrosiae diffundit odorem' (She spoke, giving off the flowing
fragrance of ambrosia).  Cyrene is encouraging her despondent son,
Aristaeus, to learn his fate from Proteus.

	|151-154.~  Dante now 'finishes' the Beatitude (Matthew 5:6) begun in
^Purgatorio~ XXII.4-6, 'Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt iustitiam,
quoniam ipsi saturabuntur' (Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied).  In the first
context, applying to those who 'thirst' for riches, only ^sitiunt~ was
heard, while here we have the echo only of the word for hunger,
^esuriunt~.
