Dante's simile here, perfect in form, masks its formal 
vacuity: 'as is the sun in a certain position, so was it then' (e.g., 
'as a commentator shakes his head in complaint, so did he shake his 
head'). Dante enjoys using this sort of comparison. See the note to 
<i>Inferno</i> XXX.136-141, in which reference is made to the study of this 
phenomenon (sometimes referred to as 'false simile' or as 
'pseudo-simile') by Eric Mallin (&ldquo;The False Simile in Dante's 
<i>Commedia</i>,&rdquo; <i>Dante Studies</i> 102 [1984], pp. 15-36).

Using his usual four coordinates, each 90<sup>o</sup> apart from the next 
(Jerusalem, Spain , India, the antipodes), Dante, like clocks on the 
wall in an air terminal, tells us the global condition of the time. It 
is 6pm now on the mountain. At the start of the <i>cantica</i> a similar 
passage described dawn (<i>Purg.</i> II.1-9), with the sun's position with 
regard to all these coordinates 180<sup>o</sup> distant from where it is now.

This angel has a unique function, since he, like the warder 
at the gate below, supervises a border beyond which purgation is not 
performed; however, unlike the warder, he functions within the 
territory of his terrace and his task is not replicated by an angel on 
any other terrace. He supervises what seems to be a form of final 
expiation and acceptance that mirrors Christ's baptism by fire (Matthew 
3:11), as promised by John the Baptist: the Lord whom he serves will 
baptize 'with the Holy Ghost and with fire.' Absent as far as one can 
tell from the commentary tradition, this citation was suggested by an 
undergraduate at Princeton (Joseph Taylor '70) many years ago. The 
angel seems to be addressing 'blessèd souls,' 
whether <i>in re</i> (Statius) or <i>in potentia</i> (Dante); Virgil, of course, 
is excluded from blessedness.

Most recent commentators believe that Dante here refers to a 
corpse being laid in a grave, i.e., he felt as dead as a man being 
placed in his grave (i.e., 'I became so terrified that I looked like a 
dead man': Benvenuto's reading (comm. to vv. 7-15). Others, beginning 
with Lombardi (comm. to verse 15), argue that this <i>fossa</i> (pit, grave 
[it can mean either; in its last appearance at <i>Purg.</i> XVIII.121 it 
meant 'grave']) refers to the deeper and narrower pit that is used to 
bury a criminal alive and to which Dante has earlier referred (<i>Inf.</i> 
XIX.46-47). However, this form of punishment, <i>propagginazione,</i> 
involves suffocating a criminal by covering him with earth after he has 
been placed upside down in a pit, a posture that does not seem germane 
to this passage. Perhaps for this reason most (but not all) recent 
discussants read the line as we do.

Exactly what Dante's physical posture here is has been 
variously understood. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) review a 
number of these discussions and make the sensible suggestion that Dante 
is holding his hands toward the fire, feeling its heat on them and 
attempting to keep the rest of his body as far as possible from the 
flame behind those extended hands, while he bends his head toward it, 
peering into it. Those who argue that Dante has joined his hands do 
not deal with the fact that the other three times in the <i>Comedy</i> when 
he uses a form of this past participle of <i>commettere</i> (to commit) it 
never means 'join together,' as most take it to mean here. (See <i>Inf.</i> 
VII.62 and <i>Inf.</i> XIX.47, as well as <i>Purg.</i> X.57.) In other words, he 
has 'committed' his hands to the fire, i.e., stretched them out toward 
it.

The currently most favored reading of these lines is already 
found in Tozer (comm. to vv. 16-18): 'Burning was a mode of punishment 
at Florence at this period, and Dante himself had been condemned to be 
burnt alive at the time of his banishment.' In short, Dante, having 
seen human beings burned alive in the public square, and having been 
promised exactly such treatment should he ever attempt to return to 
Florence from his exile, is understandably frozen by fear. For him, a 
man in the flesh, the danger of the fire seems, naturally enough, far 
greater than it must have to those who were there in spirit only. 
They, to be sure, suffer mental anguish as they purge their sin of lust 
in the flames; Dante understandably imagines that the fire will work 
quite differently upon him.

In a wonderfully wrought sequence, Virgil has given,

In Ovid's story (<i>Metam</i>. IV.55-166), the myth that accounts 
for why the fruit of the mulberry tree is red, Pyramus and Thisbe are 
neighbors in the Babylon of Queen Semiramis (see <i>Inf.</i> V.58). They 
are in love. Since their parents forbid them to marry, they speak to 
one another lovingly through a little gap in the common wall of their 
houses. They conspire to meet one night at the tomb of Ninus, the dead 
king, former husband of Semiramis. Thisbe arrives first but, as luck 
would have it, a lioness, fresh from the kill and covered in the blood 
of the cattle she had slain, seeking a fountain to slake her thirst, 
frightened Thisbe away. The beast, returning from her drink and 
finding the cloak that fleeing Thisbe had dropped on the ground, soils 
that garment with her bloody maw. Pyramus, arriving late for his 
assignation, finds the bloodied cloth and assumes the worst. Blaming 
himself for Thisbe's putative death, he kills himself with his sword. 
His spurting blood colors the white fruit of the mulberry red. 
Returning, Thisbe finds the body of her beloved. In anguish she calls 
out his name and her own, and he opens his eyes and recognizes her just 
before he dies. In turn, she uses the sword of Pyramus to take her own 
life.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
The simile that Dante contrives from this material gives the name of 
Beatrice the same role as that of Thisbe. Virgil speaks her name just 
as Thisbe had spoken her own. In Dante's case it revives the will to 
continue toward salvation in a lover who has felt he was at the verge 
of death, while in the case of Pyramus there is no larger sense of 
redemption, only a moment of tragic recognition. Why does Dante 
construct this similetic moment out of such antithetic material? His 
love for Beatrice leads to life, Pyramus's love for Thisbe, to death. 
When we hear Dante's name on the lips of Beatrice (<i>Purg.</i> XXX.55), we 
are in a better position to see the complex relations between these two 
acts of naming here and two kinds of love.

On the relations between the mulberry and the Tree of the Knowledge of 
Good and Evil from which Eve and then Adam ate, as well as the cross on 
which Christ died and hung like bloodied fruit, see Christian Moevs

<i>Imagining Heaven in the Middle Ages: A Book of Essays</i>, ed. Jan Swango

Fergusson (<i>Dante's Drama of the Mind</i> [Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1953]), p. 167, makes a case for the importance of the reference 
to Christ's blood in line 2 of the opening simile of the canto to this 
later motif. And see Moevs (p. 229) for a potential citation here of a 
passage in Augustine's <i>De ordine</i> (I.3), when the still unconverted 
catechumen is angered when he hears a young poet named (appropriately 
enough) Licentius reciting a poem about Pyramus and Thisbe. Licentius, 
Augustine says, may be 'erecting between [himself] and reality a wall 
more impenetrable than [the one his verses] are trying to rear between 
the lovers.' For Pyramus and Thisbe in the tradition of Romance 
vernacular prior to Dante see Gianfranco Contini (<i>Un' idea di Dante</i>

We had previously known that Dante was following the two 
other poets (see <i>Purg.</i> XXVI.16-18) and now we learn that Statius has 
been nearest him, with Virgil in the lead. As Bosco/Reggio point out 
(comm. to verse 47), Virgil's tactic here is reminiscent of his staying 
behind Dante to protect him from Geryon's sting (<i>Inf.</i> XVII.83-84). 
Here, however, one might add, Virgil is not worried about protecting 
Dante, but by the possibility that he would try to flee back through 
the flames. And thus Statius is deployed as a rearguard, not against 
any enemy, but against the questionable will of the protagonist. 
Further, Virgil, by making Dante come closer, arranges things so that 
it is easier to control him.

While one wants to be cautious about such things, Virgil's 
naming of Beatrice here represents the ninth time that her name has 
appeared in the poem and the last time before she names herself 
(<i>Purg.</i> XXX.73). Since Dante likes to use the rhythm of 9 plus 1 to 
represent the movement from good to best (<i>Vita nuova</i>: nine 
appearances of Beatrice to Dante on earth, in one form or another, 
surmounted by a tenth and heavenly vision; <i>Paradiso</i>: nine heavenly 
spheres surmounted by the perfection of the Empyrean [see Hollander 
(&ldquo;<i>Vita Nuova</i>: Dante's Perceptions of Beatrice,&rdquo; <i>Dante Studies</i> 92 
[1974], pp. 1-18)]), it is at least conceivable that there is such a 
program at work for the appearances of the names of Beatrice in this 
part of the poem. As Frederick Locke (&ldquo;Dante's Miraculous Enneads,&rdquo; 
<i>Dante Studies</i> 85 [1967], pp. 59-70) pointed out, Beatrice's name 
appears 63 times in the <i>Comedy</i>, and that number is a 'nine' (6 plus 3 = 
9). It is possible that Dante was counting his uses of her name and 
deliberately chose to have it appear exactly nine times before she 
revealed herself to Dante. The pattern would have been more pleasing 
had Virgil spoken that name each of those nine times; however, once it 
is Dante himself who speaks it, in his conversation with Forese. 
Beatrice's name appears as follows in the first sixty-three cantos of 
the poem: <i>Inf.</i> II.70, <i>Inf.</i> II.103, <i>Purg.</i> VI.46, <i>Purg.</i> XV.77, 
<i>Purg.</i> XVIII.48, <i>Purg.</i> XVIII.73, <i>Purg.</i> XXIII.128 (spoken by 
Dante), <i>Purg.</i> XXVII.36, and here.

The scene we expect, as the protagonist completes his ritual 
purging on a terrace, is the removal of one (in this case the seventh 
and last) P from his forehead. Apparently the poet decided to avoid 
representing this climactic moment, allowing it either to be intrinsic, 
or else perhaps allowing us to believe that the fire itself cleansed 
the protagonist of his predisposition toward lust. But this is the 
moment (not before the entrance to the fire, as some believe) at which 
the ritual act should be performed, just before the upward movement to 
the next area of the mountain, as it has been on the other terraces 
(see an associated discussion of the angels' recitations of the 
Beatitudes in the note to <i>Purg.</i> XV.38-39).
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
Trucchi (comm. to vv. 10-15) counts the angels who serve God's ends in

remarks): the Christian Mercury who brings the living dead to the 
mountain (<i>Purg.</i> II.43), the angelic warder at the gate (<i>Purg.</i> 
IX.104), the seven who are associated with the virtues opposed to the 
vices repented at the end of the experience of each terrace, and now 
this one.

This final angel of purgatory (in paradise we see Gabriel circling the

As, among the early commentators, only he who speaks from the 
pages of the Codice Cassinese pointed out, the passage reflects the 
words that Christ will speak to the just at the Day of Judgment: 'Then 
shall the King say unto them on his right hand, &ldquo;Come, blessèd of 
my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the 
[time of the] foundation of the world&rdquo;' (Matthew 25:34). In the 
twentieth century notice began again to be paid to this absolutely 
relevant text. As Singleton reports (comm. to this verse), Ernest 
Hatch Wilkins (&ldquo;Dante and the Mosaics of his <i>Bel San Giovanni</i>,&rdquo; 
<i>Speculum</i> 2 [1927]), p. 5, pointed out that a mosaic in the Florentine 
Baptistery showed a gate guarded by an angel who welcomes a newly 
arrived soul, while a second angel leads a group of the saved and 
carries a banner that is inscribed 'Come, blessèd of my Father, 
possess what has been prepared.' Dante's second and singing angel 
would certainly seem to be modeled on that second angel and his words. 
And that there are two angels on this terrace may reflect his memory of 
the mosaic.

The angel's words, as many now note, are a sort of 
paraphrase of John 12:35: 'Walk while you have the light, that darkness

been the first commentator to notice the correlation. That it should 
have waited so long to be observed is comprehensible, since it is not a 
literal citation so much as a recasting of John's thought. This second 
angel, exactly like the first on this terrace, first speaks in Latin 
and then in the vernacular. See, again, the note to <i>Purgatorio</i>

Dante's playfulness is for some reason particularly evident 
in his similes, which often and deliberately have 'something wrong' in 
them, incomplete grammatical relations, mixtures of styles, and other 
apparent 'defects.' Here, on the other hand, we have a perfectly 
developed and complex 'classical' simile: 'Just as... and just as... 
so.' Anyone examining the passage closely is likely to perceive that 
there are things 'wrong' here as well. Let us consider the components 
of the simile:
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
<pre>
<i>Dante (singular) Virgil and Statius (plural)</i>
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
76-81 goats (plural) shepherd (singular)

82-84 flock (plural) herdsman (singular)
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
85-87 goat (singular) shepherds (plural)
</pre>
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
Several things are worth remarking. This simile is mainly 
unadulterated vernacular pastoral with a few Latinate words (and 
perhaps a phrase from Virgil at line 77 from <i>Georgics</i> IV.10, 
according to Daniello [comm. to vv. 76-81] and many of those who 
followed him). But why does Dante not get his singulars and plurals 
straight in the first two elements, only to correct them in the third? 
Why does he include the second element at all, since he excludes it 
from his summarizing and concluding third element? And why, as Torraca 
(comm. to vv. 76-78) wondered, is the shepherd standing up (if leaning 
on his stick) while Virgil and Statius are lying down? Is that why, 
Torraca continued to wonder, Dante included the second element, in 
which the herdsman is at least closer to lying down? The purpose of 
these questions is to focus attention on how much Dante expects of his 
reader. These little touches, reminding us of his artistic freedom, 
make us aware of that.

The phrase <i>rapide e proterve</i> in verse 77 (which we have 
translated as 'quick and reckless'), according to some commentators, 
beginning with Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 76-87), means 'rapaces et 
temerariae' (rapacious and bold). Others have objected to the first of 
these terms, more fitting to the description of the appetite of a wolf, 
as being inapplicable to goats. On the other hand, if we understood 
the word to mean 'voracious,' there would be no such problem. We, 
however, believe that Dante is referring to the way a free-roaming goat 
moves, rather than to the way it eats, but have no quarrel with those 
who follow Benvenuto.

The stars look bigger and brighter because Dante is higher 
up and closer to them than he has ever been in his life. There may be 
a moral atmosphere at work here as well, in that he has lost the 
obscuring mantle of sin that is our normal lot (see <i>Purg.</i> XXX.3), and 
that also would make them seem brighter. For exactly such a twofold

'Cytherea' is a proper noun formed from the epithet used of the 
'maritime' Venus, the lustful goddess born of the spume of the sea near 
the island Cythera. Dante here presents her as morning star, as she 
was seen at the opening of the <i>cantica.</i> However, and as has been 
pointed out in recent years with increasing insistence, in 1300 Venus 
was the evening star at this period of the year, and the morning star 
only in 1301. See the discussion in Graziella Federici Vescovini 
(&ldquo;Dante e l'astronomia del suo tempo,&rdquo; <i>Letteratura italiana antica</i> 3

the three dreams in <i>Purgatorio</i> (see <i>Purg.</i> IX.13-33 and <i>Purg.</i> 
XIX.1-33). Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban in Genesis, were 
understood by Christian interpreters to represent, respectively, the 
active life and the contemplative life (and thus Rachel's staring into 
the mirror is not to be taken as narcissistic self-admiration but 
contemplation in a positive sense). It is clear that Dante is making 
use of that tradition here. However, he is also making use of biblical 
typology in his treatment of Leah, who is related to Eve in her as yet 
unfallen condition in that she is doing what Adam and Eve were told 
to do, 'ut <i>operaretur</i> et custodiret illum' (to dress [the garden] and 
keep it -- Genesis 2:15). Dante's verb in the last line of Leah's 
speech, which concludes the dream, remembers the biblical verb in his 
<i>ovrare</i>, the working in this garden that points back to the tasks of 
that one before the Fall (see Hollander, <i>Allegory in Dante's 
&ldquo;Commedia&rdquo;</i> [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 153). 
For the balanced relationships between the pair Leah and Rachel and a 
second pair, Matelda and Beatrice, the two central female presences in 
the earthly paradise, see Paola Pacchioni (&ldquo;Lia e Rachele, Matelda e 
Beatrice,&rdquo; <i>L'Alighieri</i> 18 [2001], pp. 47-74).

It is probably also fair to say that the text intrinsically presents 
Dante as a new Jacob: 'As Jacob toiled for seven years in order to gain 
the hand of Rachel, only to be given that of Leah (Genesis 29:10f.), so 
Dante has toiled up seven terraces of purgation with the promise of 
Beatrice, only to find Matelda' (Hollander, <i>Allegory in Dante's 
&ldquo;Commedia&rdquo;</i> [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 151-52). 
Giovanni Pascoli (<i>La mirabile visione</i> [Bologna: Zanichelli, 1923 
(1902)]), p. 462, had much earlier suggested that Dante, 'the new 
Aeneas,' was also the 'new Jacob.' Pascoli was followed, without their 
apparent knowledge, by Singleton (<i>Journey to Beatrice</i> [Cambridge: 
Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), p. 108, and by T. K. Swing 
(<i>The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl</i> [Westminster: The Newman Press, 
1962]), p. 95. The Italian tradition has for a long time insisted only 
on the 'allegorical' equation here, Leah as the active life, Rachel as 
the contemplative. A figural understanding (i.e., one developed from 
'historical allegory,' as in the interpretation of the Bible itself), 
has mainly been absent. But see Momigliano (comm. to these verses) who 
almost resolves the problem in this way. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 
91-108) offer a long and confessedly 'perplexed' attempt to account for 
the resulting supposedly double (and thus inadmissible) valence of 
Beatrice as both 'theology' and 'the contemplative life.' For another 
reading of this dream see Zygmunt Baranski (&ldquo;Dante's Three Reflective 
Dreams,&rdquo; <i>Quaderni d'italianistica</i> 10 [1989]), pp. 219-24.

Awakening, the protagonist (and Statius, but Virgil only 
problematically so) is associated with travelers who are getting nearer 
home. It is quite clear that 'home' now is at the very least the 
garden of Eden, and perhaps the true paradise that lies above. There 
are no thoughts of Florence here. In these lines the true pilgrimage 
becomes a journey from God, into the world, and back to God. It is 
interesting to compare the beautiful and sad opening of the eighth 
canto of this <i>cantica</i>, with its traveler whose thoughts are on 
friends left behind in the world. This pilgrim/traveler has apparently 
learned a good deal on the mountain.

Since the garden of Eden seems to be just slightly below the 
level to which the travelers have now climbed (see <i>Purg.</i> XXVIII.4), 
this topmost step of the stair is the highest point on earth attained 
by Dante, and by Virgil as well, but he has no further rising to do.

Virgil's final speech in the poem may be clarified by a 
summarizing paraphrase. (1) I have brought you, with intellect and 
skill, through flames temporal (purgatory) and eternal (hell) and have 
reached the limit of my powers; (2) from now on follow your own 
inclination as your guide, since you are free; (3) see the sun and the 
freely growing vegetation here; until Beatrice, whose weeping eyes sent 
me to you, comes glad-eyed into your presence, you may choose to sit or 
wander; (4) no more do I speak or gesture; your will is free, upright, 
and whole; do its pleasure -- and thus do I crown and miter you over 
yourself.

If Dante's will is as good as Virgil will shortly say it is, 
he can take pleasure as his guide because he will only want that which

It is perhaps useful to consider an attempt to see how the 
poem may be divided into four large units, as follows:
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
<pre>
<i>Dante's development locus guide</i>
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
I. correction of the will <i>Inf</i>. I-XXXIV Virgil
II. perfection of the will <i>Purg</i>. I-XXIX Virgil
III. correction of the intellect <i>Purg</i>. XXX-<i>Par</i>. XXX Beatrice
IV. perfection of the intellect <i>Par</i>. XXX-end Bernard

See Hollander (&ldquo;The Invocations of the <i>Commedia</i>,&rdquo; <i>Yearbook of 
Italian Studies</i> 3 [1976], pp. 235-40). And for the possible 
contribution of St. Bernard to this schema, see the note to <i>Paradiso</i> 
XXXIII.127-132.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
It is at this moment that Virgil gives over the instructional task 
that has been his since <i>Inferno</i> I, presiding over the correction and 
perfection of Dante's will. A less developed version of this schema is 
found in Singleton (<i>Journey to Beatrice</i> [Cambridge: Harvard 
University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 11-12, where Virgil is seen as 
leading Dante to 'a condition of rectitude in the will,' while the goal 
to which Beatrice leads him 'is one in which intellect is primary.'

The precise meaning and reference of this concluding verse has 
been the subject of much discussion. The meta-literary sense that he 
has of the canto as a whole leads Picone (&ldquo;<i>Purgatorio</i> XXVII: 
passaggio rituale e <i>translatio</i> poetica,&rdquo; <i>Medioevo romanzo</i> 12 
[1987]), pp. 400-1, to allegorize the crown and miter that Virgil 
awards Dante as (1) the triumphant laurel of the modern poet and (2) 
the Christian truth that he can add to Virgil's store of pagan wisdom 
and poetic technique. As Remo Fasani (&ldquo;Canto XXVII,&rdquo; in <i>Lectura 
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio</i>, ed. Georges Güntert and Michelangelo 
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 432, points out, although the 
modern discussion has tended to treat the terms as synonyms, as long 
ago as in the commentaries of the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 139-142) and of 
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 124-142), they were understood as 
separate entities. To the Ottimo they signified 'rector and shepherd'; 
to Francesco, laurel crown ('<i>corono</i>; di laurea, come poeta') and 
bishop's miter ('come vescovo e guidatore dell'anima tua a l'eterna 
salute' [as bishop and guide over your own soul, bound for eternal 
salvation]), two very different sorts of adornment for Dante's head. 
Fasani opts for the crown as sign of Dante's active life, his temporal 
(and decidedly imperial) political mission, and sees the miter as an 
image of his contemplative life, the poet's spiritual mission.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
In the recent and continuing argument there are those who argue, as 
did Contini (<i>Un' idea di Dante</i> [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), pp. 188-89, 
citing Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) who had come upon a 
description of the coronation of the emperor Otto IV in 1209 in which 
he was crowned <i>and</i> mitered in a study by one Father Ponta, collected 
in his <i>Opere su Dante</i>, published in 1845, pp. 189 and 193, that for 
Virgil to grant ecclesiastical authority is totally foreign to anything 
we have read in this poem. In an entirely similar mode, Singleton 
(<i>Journey to Beatrice</i> [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 
(1958)]), pp. 64-69, cites (not Ponta or Scartazzini or Contini) Ernst 
Kantorowicz (<i>The King's Two Bodies</i> [Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1957]), pp. 491-92, for the use of the miter in the crowning of 
the temporal ruler. This series of interesting attempts to make 
Virgil's last words in the poem tautological does, however, leave one 
less than easily convinced; the word 'miter' is removed from an 
ecclesiastical context only with difficulty.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
Virgil can make Dante neither an emperor nor a bishop (and surely not 
a pope). He is metaphorically crowning Dante for now having, in his 
will, the ability to rule himself morally, as the world, were it only 
better governed, would be ruled by two powers, emperor and pope. Dante 
is now said by Virgil to be in complete command of the powers of his 
will, a microcosmic image of the world made just (improbable as Dante 
would have thought such a happy state) under its two prime authorities.
