	|1-3.~  Dante and Oderisi are continuing their movement forward in 
humility, purging their pride in their differing ways until such time 
as Virgil will insist on Dante's pursuing other instruction.  Strictly 
speaking, in ancient Greece a 'pedagogue' was a slave whose task it was 
to guide children to school and supervise their conduct generally (but 
not to teach them); in ancient Rome the slave was frequently a Greek 
and had similar responsibilities, but also introduced the children to 
the beginning study of Greek.  Dante's word, ^pedagogo~, here in one of 
its first appearances in the Italian vernacular, according to the 
^Grande Dizionario~, has a brief but important role (occurring twice) 
in a single biblical passage, Paul's Epistle to the Galatians 3:24-25 
(Longfellow [comm. to verse 3] seems to have been the first to note the 
possible connection).  In that passage Paul imagines us as having once 
been, under the Old Testament, guided by the ^paedagogus~ (the Law) but 
as now being taught by Christ, and thus as no longer requiring such 
guidance.  This Dantean hapax (a word occurring only once in a given 
universe of words) may reflect that biblical near-hapax.  (Perhaps it 
should be noted that, two cantos farther on [^Purg~. XIV.85], Dante 
fairly evidently cites another passage in Galatians [Gal. 6.8] -- see 
Moore [^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical 
Authors in Dante~ (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]), p. 332].  If he 
does, its use here involves a certain apparently gratuitous downgrading 
of Virgil's admonitions, so frequently before us in this canto.  Their 
frequency is observed by Giulio Marzot ["^Purgatorio~ Canto XII," in 
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967), pp. 405-33], 
in whose opinion this canto is 'il canto delle ammonizioni' [p. 422].)

	For the yoke that binds these two 'oxen' see the commentary of Fallani 
(comm. to this passage) and Scott's ^lectura~ ("Canto XII," in ^Lectura 
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo 
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 174: 'For my yoke is easy and my 
burden light' (Matthew 11:29-30) -- the words of Christ preaching to 
potential followers.

	|4-6.~  Virgil's metaphor is probably developed, as Bosco/Reggio 
(1978) insist, on ^Aeneid~ III.520: 'velorum pandimus alas' (we spread 
the wings of our sails), a passage cited by many commentators at 
^Inferno~ XXVI.125, 'de' remi facemmo ali' (we turned our oars to 
wings).

	Petrocchi, in his reading of the line, overturns the previously 
favored opinion that Dante's text read ^vele~ (sails), but has the 
disadvantage of forcing the poet into a very mixed metaphor, 'wings and 
oars.'  We would have followed the older reading, 'sails and oars.'

	|7-9.~  The protagonist walks erect, as Ovid describes humans doing so 
as to be distinguished from brutes (^Metam~. I.84-86).  Benvenuto 
(comm. to vv. 4-9) cites Ovid's words and mentions the additional 
authority of Cicero, Sallust, and Juvenal on this matter.

	The word ^scemi~, which we have translated as 'shrunken,' has caused 
some discomfort.  What exactly does it mean?  Marcello Aurigemma ("Il 
Canto XII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV 
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1970]), pp. 109-10, claims that Oderisi's dour 
prophecy of Dante's future ills (XI.140-141) leaves the protagonist 
feeling ^monco~ (incomplete) until such time as that disaster will 
finally confront him.  He is following the nearly unanimous view found 
in the earliest commentators.  However, since the time of Landino 
(1481) the more usual interpretation relates Dante's interior moral 
posture rather to his responses to Pride, whether in pity for the souls 
he now sees or in recognition of his own (former) pridefulness ^--~ the 
most usual version of that position today, expressed in the form that 
currently rules by Torraca in 1905 (comm. to these verses), noting the 
'heavy swelling' (^Purg~. XI.119) of pride that Dante is getting under 
control.  As a result, his thoughts are ^scemi~ in that they are 
lacking in pride.  In other words, even if he has finally straightened 
up and begun walking as a confident human being, his thoughts remain 
bowed under the burden of the recognition of his pridefulness.

	|12.~  Dante's new incredible lightness of being matches Virgil's 
usual state as soul unencumbered by body; getting his pride under 
control, the protagonist experiences the greatest and quickest 
spiritual growth we will observe in him during his ascent of the 
mountain.

	|13-15.~  Now that Dante has experienced and embraced the positive 
exemplars of Humility, Virgil wants to confirm his new state by making 
him experience the negative exemplars of Pride in order to seal his 
'conversion' to humility.  For exemplarity in the middle ages and in 
Dante see Delcorno (^Exemplum e letteratura tra medioevo e 
rinascimento~ [Bologna: Il Mulino, 1989]), esp. Ch. VI, "Dante e 
Peraldo," pp. 195-227.  And for his discussion of the exemplars in this 
canto as deriving in part from William Peraldus's ^Summa vitiorum~, see 
pp. 210-14; Delcorno shows that Dante's list of six biblical exemplars 
of Pride is related to Peraldus's first seven in his list of twelve 
biblical exemplars.  Dante shares five of his six with Peraldus, 
substituting (for Adam) Nimrod (a choice, one might add, that 
underlines the poet's understandable concern with language -- see the 
note to ^Inf~. XXXI.67).  Then, in typical Dantean fashion, he adds six 
pagan exemplars to his shortened and revised version of Peraldus's 
list.  For perhaps the first modern recognition of the importance of 
Peraldus's listing and description of the vices for Dante, see Wenzel 
("Dante's Rationale for the Seven Deadly Sins [^Purgatorio~ XVII]," 
^Modern Language Review~ 60 [1965], pp. 529-33), pointing out that 
Pietro di Dante's commentary to ^Purgatorio~ XVII relies strictly and 
extensively upon Peraldus's phrasing (wherever he found his version of 
Peraldus's text) for his description of the seven mortal sins (comms. 
to vv. 97-99; 100-102; 112-114; 115-117; 118-123).

	For consideration of the history of the classification of the capital 
vices see Morton W. Bloomfield (^The Seven Deadly Sins~ [East Lansing: 
Michigan State College Press, 1952]); for Dante's classifications see 
Edward Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Second Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ 
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1899)], pp. 152-208).

	|16-24.~  The figured pavement upon which the travelers walk is 
compared in simile to the gravestones set into church floors bearing 
the indications of the dead person's profession, family, or other 
identifying trait, as well as his or her likeness.

	|22-24.~  As was the case with God's art found in the intaglios upon 
the mountainside, here too divine art knows no human equal (cf. ^Purg~. 
X.32-33).

	|25-63.~  Reading down the left-hand margin of the verses, we find a 
series of repeated letters beginning a series of tercets.  They spell 
out a word.  Lia Baldelli, "acrostico" (ED.1970.1, p. 44), points out 
that perception of Dante's deployment of this technique escaped the 
attention of the early commentators; it was only in 1898 that Antonio 
Medin noticed the presence of the acrostic in these lines, the word VOM 
[or UOM, ^uomo~, or 'man'], while the presence of a similar acrostic, 
found at ^Paradiso~ XIX.115-141, yielding LVE [or LUE, 'plague'], was 
only noted by Francesco Flamini in 1903.  Most now accept the fact, 
despite a perhaps understandable modern distaste for such contrivance, 
that these two acrostics were deliberately constructed by the author 
(see, for more on Dante's acrostic proclivities, John Scott ["Canto 
XII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert 
and Michelangelo Picone (Florence: Cesati, 2001), p. 176 and n.].  
Spurred by these findings, others have tried to establish a wider 
pattern of such things, e.g., Deroy ("Un acrostico nella preghiera di 
San Bernardo," in ^Miscellanea dantesca~ [Utrecht: Het Spectrum, 1965], 
pp. 103-13): ^Paradiso~ XXXIII.19-33 (IOSEP [for Joseph, the earthly 
father of Jesus]); Berk ("Some Sibylline Verses in ^Purgatorio~ X and 
XII,"  ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972], pp. 59-76): ^Purgatorio~ X.67-75 (DIQ 
= DIO, to contrast with VOM = UOM in ^this~ passage); Kay ("Dante's 
Acrostic Allegations: ^Inf~. XI-XII," ^L'Alighieri~ 21 [1980], pp. 
29-30): acrostics are everywhere, e.g., (Kay's first example) ^Inferno~ 
XVIII.1-7 (LNQ = ^L~uca^N~o in ^Q~uarto = ^De bello civili~ IV.12-16); 
and Taylor ("From ^superbo Il,i@on~ to ^umile Italia~": The 
Acrostic of ^Paradiso~ 19," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 7 [1987], pp. 
47-65): ^Paradiso~ XIX.128-129 (adding two letters [IM] to LUE = LUEIM, 
an anagram for UMILE, 'humble').  For a withering sceptical response to 
these ingenious efforts see Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine 
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1992]), pp. 308-10.   Nonetheless, Kay's article offers a useful 
compendium (p. 26) of treatments of acrostics in various encyclopedias 
and dictionaries of classical and medieval learning.

	For a discussion of negative critical reactions to the acrostic on 
aesthetic grounds, as well as of its function in its context here, see 
Marcello Aurigemma ("Il Canto XII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove letture 
dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1970]), pp. 113-19.

	|25-27.~  Naturally, the first exemplar of the sin of pride is Satan, 
its avatar (see the note to ^Inf~. XXXI.28-33 for his association with 
those other emblems of Pride, the giants who stormed Olympus).  He is 
intrinsically opposed to the first exemplar of humility, the Virgin 
Mary, as is evident.  When Dante drew near to the end of his poem 
(^Par~. XXXIII.2), he underlined this with a verse in description of 
Mary, 'umile e alta pi@u che creatura' (humble and exalted more 
than any creature), reflecting his description of (the unnamed) Lucifer 
here, who was more noble when he was created than any other creature.  
Trucchi (comm. to this passage) observes Dante's borrowing from the 
Bible, his 'folgoreggiando scender' (fall like lightning from the sky) 
echoing the similar phrase in Luke 10:18: 'Satanam, sicut fulgur de 
coelo cadentem' ([I beheld] Satan as lightning fall from heaven).

	|28-30.~  We finally catch a glimpse of Briareus, so important an 
absence in the amusing business that occupies Dante and Virgil in 
^Inferno~ XXXI.97-105 (and see the corresponding note), when Virgil 
denies Dante the sight of this giant, whom he has described, in his 
^Aeneid~, as having fifty heads and one hundred arms.  Dante makes him, 
from what we can see, an 'ordinary' giant, a pagan version of Lucifer 
for his presumption in challenging Jove.  Briareus is mentioned in the 
three major martial epics that Dante knew and used, ^Aeneid~ X.565, 
^Thebaid~ II.596, ^Pharsalia~ IV.596.

	|31-33.~  Uniquely among the twelve sets of exemplars, the 
non-exemplary figures are the ones named (Apollo by his epithet 
Thymbraeus, Minerva by her second name [Pallas], and Mars), those who 
witnessed the defeat of the unnamed, exemplary giants (including 
Briareus), undone by the thunderbolts of Jove, their father.  These 
exemplars are, in a wonderfully appropriate 'punishment,' present only 
as ^disiecta membra~, the scattered remains of the outsized human 
creatures they once were.  Because of the relationship between these 
two non-biblical scenes, they are described one after the other.  
However, we cannot be certain whether all six biblical and all six 
classical scenes are paired in parallel rows or whether, in this and 
the following examples, the order within the pairs is switched from the 
first occurrence, as indeed seems to be the case.  The reason for such 
an arrangement would seem to have been in order to head the list with 
Lucifer, but then to have the general pattern be based on a pagan 
followed by a biblical exemplar.

	|34-36.~  For Nimrod, see the note to ^Inferno~ XXXI.70-81.  He is 
accompanied by those who helped build the Tower of Babel on the plains 
of Shinar.  And see Genesis 10:8-10; 11:1-4.  Described as looking as 
if he were bewildered by the adjective ^smarrito~, used a dozen times 
in the ^Commedia~, and most often to refer to the protagonist's 
condition of being lost, bewildered, or astray, Nimrod may eventually 
reflect the poet if he felt that he had tried to storm Olympus by 
writing this poem, a mere Babelic outpouring of language if it is not 
redeemed by God's grace.  Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": 
Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992]), 
pp. 51, 115, 283, argues that Nimrod, Ulysses, and Phaeton are ^--~ 
uniquely ^--~ figures who appear or are mentioned in all three 
^cantiche~ and are also associated with the theme of transgression; but 
see Stull and Hollander ("The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)]), pp. 47-48, pointing out that 
Plato, Julius Caesar, and the inordinately non-transgressive Lavinia 
all fulfill Barolini's criteria for this category.  Nonetheless, Guy P. 
Raffa (^Divine Dialectic: Dante's Incarnational Poetry~ [Toronto: 
Toronto University Press, 2000]), p. 58, apparently unaware of the 
facts in question, accepts Barolini's argument.  For a survey of hapax 
in the ^Commedia~, see Hollander ("An Index of Hapax Legomena in 
Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988], pp. 81-110).

	|37-39.~  Niobe was the wife of Amphion, king of Thebes, and mother of 
seven sons and seven daughters.  When she boasted that she was a better 
mother than Latona, who had but two offspring (even though these were 
Apollo and Diana), in the Ovidian world it is clear what will happen 
next: the two arrow-shooting siblings wipe out the children of Niobe 
who, turned to stone, nonetheless bewails their loss with eternal tears 
that flow perpetually as mountain streams (^Metam~. VI.148-312).

	|40-42.~  Niobe's biblical counterpart is King Saul.  Relieved of his 
kingship by Samuel for failing to keep God's commands, Saul fought 
against the Philistines at Gilboa.  Mortally wounded and fearful of 
being captured by the enemy, he fell upon his sword (I Samuel 31:1-4).  
David's subsequent curse on the surrounding mountains, the witnesses of 
this scene (II Samuel 1:21), asks that neither rain nor dew reach this 
place in Samaria.

	This exemplar of a prideful suicide throws into sharp relief the far 
different suicide of Cato the Younger, with reference to which 
^Purgatorio~ opens.

	|43-45.~  Arachne's presumption took the form of a challenge to 
Minerva in weaving.  She (in this like Ovid himself? [^Metam~. 
VI.5-145]) produced a brilliant representation of the love affairs of 
the gods.  Minerva, sensing herself unable to better this work of art, 
destroyed it, and Arachne determined to do away with herself.  Minerva 
saved her life and turned the rope by which she was hanging herself 
into filament for this weaver turned spider.  See Barolini ("Arachne, 
Argus, and St. John: Transgressive Art in Dante and Ovid," 
^Mediaevalia~ 13 [1987]), pp. 213-16, for the view that Arachne serves 
as a prideful stand-in for Ulysses (and potentially for Dante himself).

	|46-48.~  Rehoboam, a son of Solomon, was chosen to become king of 
Israel.  His pride was manifest in the way he scornfully refused to 
lessen the tribute demanded of his people, at which ten of the twelve 
tribes of Israel rebelled.  When his representative, Aduram, was slain 
by the rebellious Israelites, Rehoboam ran away with unseemly haste, 
even though he was not being pursued (see I Kings 12:1-18).

	|49-51.~  In Statius's ^Thebaid~ (IV.187-213), Alcmaeon, son of 
Amphiaraus, the seer (who is, in a certain sense, a stand-in for 
Statius himself [see the note to ^Inf~. XX.31-39]), is left with the 
task of avenging his father's death.  This came about after his wife, 
the mother of Alcmaeon, Eriphyle, betrayed his whereabouts to Polynices 
for the price of a necklace, with the result that Amphiaraus (see 
^Inf~. XX.31-36), who had foreseen the dreadful end of the civil war in 
Thebes and had hidden himself in order to escape his own death in it, 
ended up fighting and dying in the war.  He pledged his son to avenge 
him, which indeed he did do by slaying his own mother.  That the 
necklace, made by no less an artisan than Vulcan, had belonged to the 
goddess Harmonia marked Eriphyle's pride in thinking herself worthy of 
wearing it.  As was the case for Lucifer, the first exemplary figure in 
this listing, Eriphyle is not named.

	|52-54.~  'Sennacherib, King of Assyria, B.C. 705-681; after a reign 
of twenty-four years, in the course of which he twice "went up against" 
Hezekiah, king of Judah, and besieged Jerusalem, he was assassinated, 
while at worship, by his two sons (II Kings 19:37)' (Toynbee, 
"Sennacherib" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  The Vulgate (II Kings 
19:28) associates his anti-Jewish behavior with ^superbia~ (pride).

	|55-57.~  In Paulus Orosius's ^Historiae adversus paganos~ (II.vii.6) 
Dante could have read of Cyrus the Elder, founder and king of the 
Persian Empire ca. 560 B.C.  He died in battle against the Massagetae, 
in Scythia (529 B.C.), when he was ambushed by the queen of his 
enemies, Tomyris, who not only killed him, but had his decapitated head 
put into a vessel containing human blood and, according to Orosius, 
uttered words that closely resemble what Dante reports she said.

	|58-60.~  A victim of Hebrew decapitation at the hands of Judith was 
the Assyrian general Holofernes (see Judith 13:1-13).  'The leavings of 
that slaughter' are evidently the members of his decapitated body.

	This last pair of classical/biblical parallels is painfully exact, 
with vainglorious military males opposed by skillful women who cut 
their heads off.

	|61-63.~  The final example serves as a sort of summary for the entire 
acrostic.  For the medieval tradition that Troy was indeed prideful see 
Scott ("Canto XII," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. 
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), pp. 
182-83.  Dante's phrasing probably reflects ^Aeneid~ III.2-3, 'superbum 
/ Ilium,' with the phrase to be read in a moralizing ('proud Troy') 
rather than an architectural ('lofty-towered Troy') manner.  See the 
note to ^Inferno~ I.75, discussing an earlier incidence of the same 
phenomenon.

	|64-69.~  Once again, concluding an ekphrastic presentation of some 
length (cf. ^Purg~. X.94-99), the poet intervenes, now to praise the 
extraordinary mimetic quality of God's art, so precise in its 
representation that even an eyewitness of the original events saw them 
no more clearly than did Dante as he walked the Terrace of Pride.

	|70-72.~  In ^Purgatorio~ X.121-129, in the wake of ekphrastic poetry, 
Dante addresses the prideful sinners among his readers; he now does a 
similar turn here, using the rhetorical trope of ^antiphrasis~, i.e., 
expressing the opposite of what one says by means of a sarcastic tone 
of voice.

	|77.~  The phrase 'Drizza la testa' was last heard, addressed to Dante 
by Virgil as it is here, in ^Inferno~ XX.31, when the guide wanted his 
pupil to take cognizance of Amphiaraus (see the note to vv. 49-51).

	|78.~  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 76-78) was perhaps the first to cite the 
similar incitement, offered by the Sibyl to Aeneas, found at ^Aeneid~ 
VI.37 ('non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula poscit' [this hour demands 
other sights than these]).

	|79-80.~  Singleton suggests (comm. to verse 80) that, since this is 
the only angel actually to move toward Dante, his gesture is meant to 
suggest humility.  However, as Simone Marchesi has pointed out, 
responding to a draft of these notes, the Angel of Mercy even more 
certainly seems to approach Dante (^Purg~. XV.27-30).

	|81.~  The last signal of the time of day occurred at ^Purgatorio~ 
X.13-16, where we learned that it was sometime after 9am.  Here, in 
metaphoric language that presents the hours of the morning as the 
handmaids of the day, serving her highness one at a time and in 
succession, we learn that it is noon.  Thus the time spent on this 
terrace is surprisingly short, a maximum of less than three hours and 
as little as two.  

	|85.~  For the notion that Virgil's admonitions offer a major thematic 
component of this canto, see Giulio Marzot, "^Purgatorio~ Canto XII," 
in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967), p. 422, 
referring to this as 'il canto delle ammonizioni' (the canto of 
admonition).

	|90.~  That the angel comes as the morning star, Venus, otherwise 
known as Lucifer (as Benvenuto suggested (comm. to vv. 88-90), sets him 
off in a polar relationship to Satan, the first exemplar of prideful 
behavior in the figured pavement.

	|94-96.~  Who speaks these words, the angel of Humility or the poet?  
The debate has been active for years.  Marcello Aurigemma ("Il Canto 
XII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: 
Le Monnier, 1970]), pp. 123-25, after reviewing various arguments, opts 
for the notion that it is Dante who speaks.  The closeness of the 
sentiment expressed here to that found at ^Purgatorio~ X.121-129 (with 
its 'angelic butterfly' at verse 125), which issues from the poet's 
mouth, would seem to support the idea that it is the poet who speaks 
here as well.  Nonetheless, we have followed Petrocchi's punctuation, 
and it does not allow for the attribution of these lines to the poet.  
The main arguments for doing so are that for Dante to allude so clearly 
to his own special election is, even for him, a bit bold; further, the 
lack of indication of a second and new speaker and the abruptness that 
would result from such a shift both argue for Petrocchi's view; still 
further, only the angel could state as a fact that so few are chosen to 
rise this far.  On the other hand, no other angel makes comments about 
humankind that are as harsh as these, since the seven angels of 
purgatory are celebrating the continuing ascent of this special visitor 
to the mountain.  Perhaps the fullest, fairest, and most helpful gloss 
to the passage is found in Poletto's commentary (1894) to these verses, 
and he, after careful debate, comes down on the side of the attribution 
of these words to the angel.

	|98.~  The angel's wing-clap has had a result that will only become 
known at vv. 121-126: one of the P's on Dante's brow has been removed.  
This is perhaps another reason to believe that Dante has not spoken the 
last words, which might seem more self-congratulatory than humble.

	|100-108.~  The simile is redolent of the Florence left behind by the 
exiled poet.  The site of the church of San Miniato al Monte, which is 
set above and across the Arno from the city, afforded then (as it does 
now) one of the surpassingly beautiful views of Florence.  The 
Rubaconte bridge (now known as the Ponte alle Grazie) was named for its 
builder in 1237, the podest@a Rubaconte da Mandello da Milano, 
according to Giovanni Villani's ^Cronica~ (VI.26).

	The phrase 'the justly governed city' is obviously ironic.  For 
Dante's only use of this word see the last (and incomplete) sentence in 
^De vulgari eloquentia~ (II.xiv.2) where poets are seen as either 
writing in praise or in blame of their subjects, i.e. (among other 
categories), either ^gratulanter~ or ^yronice~.

	The poet remembers the 'good old days' when 'registers and measures 
could be trusted,' i.e., before the civil authorities became corrupt, 
when they kept proper records and gave proper amounts of salt (without 
withholding some for their own profit).  Documentation of these illicit 
activities may be found in ample detail in Singleton's commentary to 
vv. 104-105.

	|110.~  The ritual occurring here, involving an adaptation of a 
Beatitude spoken by Jesus, will recur on the next six terraces as well. 
 The Sermon on the Mount seems to include eight beatitudes (Matthew 
5:3-10).  For discussion of Dante's use of them, see Federigo 
Tollemache, "beatitudini evangeliche" (ED.1970.1). Tollemache points 
out that St. Thomas, whose discussion of the Beatitudes (^ST~ I.ii.69.3 
ad 5) seems to govern Dante's treatment of them, says there are seven, 
with 'Blessed are the meek' (Matthew 5:5 [5:4 in the Vulgate]) omitted, 
while those that 'hunger and thirst after righteousness' are remembered 
on separate terraces.  Thomas considers 'those who are persecuted for 
righteousness' sake' to refer to ^all~ of the first seven categories.  
Here the reference is to the first: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'  For a discussion of the program 
of the Beatitudes in ^Purgatorio~ see Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi 
("Le beatitudini e la struttura poetica del ^Purgatorio~," ^Giornale 
storico della letteratura italiana~ 161 [1984], pp. 1-29).

	|111.~  The plural here is taken by the commentators as a singular, a 
stylistic liberty allowed for speech (perhaps because the words uttered 
are more than one).  On all the terraces the fitting angel speaks his 
blessing unaccompanied.  (For the program of angelic utterance in this 
^cantica~ see the note to ^Purg~. XV.38-39).

	|112-114.~  This tercet is an evident return to the thematic 
opposition of ^musica diaboli~ and heavenly music (so present in 
purgatory once the gate is reached and entered in Canto IX).  See the 
note to ^Inferno~ XXI.136-139.

	|121-123.~  It is a Christian commonplace, followed by Dante, that 
Pride is the root sin, notwithstanding the Pauline claim that 'radix 
malorum est cupiditas' (avarice is the root of all evil -- I Timothy 
6:10).  Clearly Dante holds to the former notion, as we are here told 
that the removal of the P of Pride erases most of the indented marks 
made by each of the other six P's.  For the question as to whether or 
not Dante uniquely has a P upon his forehead see the notes to 
^Purgatorio~ IX.112 and XXI.22-24.

	|127-136.~  Anyone who has played the version of poker known as 
'hatband' will immediately understand this concluding simile, the 
lighthearted tone of which culminates only logically in Virgil's smile. 
 Having subdued his pride (and he knows how afflicted he is by this sin 
-- see ^Purg~. XIII.133-138), the protagonist feels lighter, better, 
as though his trip through purgation were half finished already.  And 
thus this canto ends with a lighter and happier feeling than any that 
precedes it, offering a sort of foretaste of Edenic innocence.

	What has escaped readers of the simile is, however, exactly what 
concrete situation the poet had in mind.  Micaela Janan suggested in 
1981, in a graduate seminar on ^Purgatorio~ at Princeton, that the 
scene is modeled upon one in Statius (^Theb~. VI.760-791).  In the 
games (modeled on those in ^Aeneid~ V) before the battle for Thebes, 
Alcidamas nicks the forehead of Capaneus with a blow.  Capaneus hears 
the onlookers's murmuring, but only realizes, when by accident he 
touches his wound, that he is bleeding.  This seems a possible, if not 
a certain, source.  On the other hand, Dante's commentators are 
maddeningly imprecise in their responses to the passage.  However, 
Portirelli (comm. to vv. 127-135) does suggest that what is at stake is 
an object put on one's head by friends as a joke.  Scartazzini (comm. 
to verse 128), following Buti (1385), thinks the object might be a 
feather.  Porena comm. to vv. 128-129) repeats these two possible 
interpretations.  It would seem reasonable to believe that Dante had 
something specific in mind (e.g., bird droppings), but we have not 
succeeded in identifying the image in his thought.
