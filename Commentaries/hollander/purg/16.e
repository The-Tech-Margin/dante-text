	|1-7.~  This fiftieth canto of the ^Divina Commedia~ is literally its 
darkest; light finally glimmers only two lines from its conclusion (in 
verse 143) and its action is played completely in the smoke of Wrath.  
Technically, the numerical midpoint of the poem occurs between Cantos 
XVI and XVII, the latter of which also happens to be the middle canto 
of ^Purgatorio~.  Thus, as the poet prepares the entire poem and the 
^cantica~ to reach their centers, it seems fitting that he first 
indicates the ^Comedy~'s origin in hell: ^Buio d'inferno~ (Gloom of 
hell).

	The sky is 'barren' (literally 'poor,' or 'impoverished') in that it 
is 'deprived of its precious jewels,' its stars (according to Benvenuto 
da Imola [comm. to vv. 1-6]), mainly found in the eighth sphere, but 
with one 'planet' found in each of the first seven), are hidden behind 
layers of clouds.

	The envious are made to repent by being denied their sight; the 
wrathful are being denied objects of sight because they were blinded by 
their anger for their enemies.

	|8-9.~  It seems that here Virgil has the power of sight, while the 
protagonist, like the penitents soon to be present, is effectively 
blind in the smoke.  Is this a deliberate recasting of the situation in 
^Purgatorio~ XV.115-138, where Dante can behold the ecstatic visions 
apparently denied to Virgil?  Once again, Virgil's state would be 
marked off as different from that of saved souls.

	The smoke that expresses the sin of Wrath on this terrace is referred 
to five times (XV.142; XVI.5, 25, 35, 142) and marks the last time in 
the poem that the noun ^fummo~ is used to describe a place.  It clearly 
seems to be related to the smoke that marked the Circle of Anger in 
Inferno, where it is used three times, once (^Inf~. IX.75) with an 
adjective, ^acerbo~ (harsh), that seems to join it to the smoke we 
enter here.  For the relationship between infernal anger and the 
purgation of Wrath see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.19-39.

	|10-15.~  The simile presents an image of Dante walking behind Virgil 
with his hand upon the shoulder of his guide, otherwise present to him 
only as a voice.  The image prepares us for what will happen once Marco 
Lombardo is his interlocutor: all he (and we) will be aware of is a 
voice, close to an ideal situation for a poet to contrive in order to 
gain undeflected attention on behalf of a presentation of moral 
philosophy.

	|19-21.~  We are presumably meant to understand that ^all~ the 
penitents pray on each of the previous terraces (see ^Purg~. XI.1-24; 
^Purg~. XIII.49-51) and on this one as well.  The pattern of communal 
liturgical prayer will be broken, for good reason, only by the 
slothful: ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.103-105.

	Fallani (comm. to verse 19) discusses the prayer, instituted as part 
of the Mass by Pope Sergius I in the seventh century, comprised, once 
it became a part of the liturgy, of a single line that is then twice 
repeated: 'Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis' (Lamb 
of God who carry off the sins of the world, have mercy on us); in the 
third iteration the last phrase ('miserere nobis') gives place to the 
words 'dona nobis pacem' (grant us peace), a particularly apt phrase 
for these penitents of Wrath, beseeching the serenity to which Virgil 
referred in ^Purgatorio~ XV.131, 'the waters of peace.'

	|25-27.~  The speaker can sense that the visitor is moving the smoke 
that he walks through and thus must be present in the flesh; for this 
reason, as he correctly assumes, the new arrival is still timebound.  
The souls on the mountain have their own temporality, but one in which 
all of time is but a necessary prolegomenon to eternity, when real life 
begins for them.  Thus for them the months of the calendar are real but 
meaningless.

	|31-36.~  Dante's ^captatio~, his attempt to gain his listener's 
goodwill (see the note to ^Inf~. II.58) celebrates the as yet unknown 
speaker's freedom from the flesh; his (rational) soul will soon be as 
it was when God breathed it into him (see ^Purg~. XXV.70-75).  The 
protagonist goes on to offer, in good rhetorical fashion, a reward for 
his auditor's collaboration.  His insistence that this spirit follow 
him is predicated upon necessity: Dante's eyes are closed because his 
mortal flesh cannot bear the harshness of the smoke, with the result 
that he cannot see his interlocutor.  The spirit, unlike Virgil, 
evidently cannot see in the darkness and therefore is only able to 
follow Dante's voice.

	|37-38.~  The image of the flesh as swaddling clothes, the protective 
cloth in which infants are wrapped, places emphasis on the soul as 
being the precious part of us, our bodies merely the wrapping that 
should keep it until it is ready for its better life.

	|41-42.~  This is the rather coy way that Dante refers to St. Paul's 
ascent to Heaven (II Corinthians 12:4) as being the last before his 
own.  For Dante, that somewhat strange word ('modern') is not a 
positive one.  (The ^Grande Dizionario~ indicates this as the first 
recorded use of the word in Italian.)  For Dante, in the battle between 
ancients and moderns, at least when it is waged on moral grounds, 
ancients are better.  For the three subsequent uses of the word see 
^Purgatorio~ XXVI.113, ^Paradiso~ XVI.33, ^Paradiso~ XXI.131.

	|46.~  Marco the Lombard: to the many previous attempts to identify 
Marco (see Singleton's commentary to this verse) we must now add that 
of Giorgio Cracco ("Tra Marco e Marco: un cronista veneziano dietro al 
canto XVI del ^Purgatorio~?" in AA. VV., ^Viridarium floridum: Studi di 
storia veneta offerti dagli allievi a Paolo Sambin~, a cura di M.C. 
Billanovich, G. Cracco, A. Rigon [Padua: Antenore, 1984], pp. 3-23.), 
who points out that a Venetian living in Lombardy wrote, ca. 1292, a 
(still unpublished) chronicle of the provinces of Venice.  He names 
himself simply as 'Marco' and his text contains a number of concerns 
and phrases that coincide with Dante's.  That Dante allows him as 
limited identification as he does may indicate that he felt Marco's 
fame was great enough that his Christian name alone was sufficient to 
identify him.

	|47-48.~  Marco's words make him seem a perfect courtier: worldly, but 
a lover of the good, and a user of soldier's language (that of 
bowmanship).  Poletto (comm. to vv. 46-49) also points out that his 
qualities would seem to mirror those of Ulysses -- or at least those 
that Ulysses lends himself, his 'fervor... to gain experience of the 
world and learn about man's vices, and his worth' (^Inf~. XXVI.97-99).

	|51.~  Strangely enough, some commentators have taken the adverbial 
preposition ^s@u~ (above) to refer to the world at the antipodes 
(e.g., John of Serravalle [comm. to vv. 49-51]) and one (Tommaseo 
[comm. to vv. 49-51]), to the earthly paradise.  However, it seems 
unmistakably clear that Marco, having learned of Dante's destination 
(verse 41), is the first spirit to ask him to pray for him once he is 
in Heaven.  This request might seem to imply either that he is of a 
particularly holy disposition or that he believes that no one on earth 
whom Dante might meet loves anything that transcends the earthly (verse 
48).  But see Guido Guinizzelli's similar request (^Purg~. 
XXVI.127-130).

	|53-63.~  Dante is bursting with a doubt, now made double by Marco's 
words: if the world is so thoroughly evil, wherein lies the cause?  
Dante wants to be informed so that he may pass the knowledge on to 
others, some of whom believe the cause is found on earth, while others 
think it is situated in the heavens.  Is his doubt now 'double' because 
he has heard from Guido del Duca (XIV.37-42) that all in the valley of 
the Arno flee virtue?  That is Benvenuto's reasonable hypothesis (comm. 
to vv. 52-57), one that has many followers.  Wanting to know the 
'cause' of evil (and his word, ^malizia~ [malice], is the word used in 
^Inf.~ XI.22 to define the sins of the hardened will [see the note to 
^Inf~. XI.22-27], those punished within the City of Dis), the 
protagonist triggers the heaviest use of this noun (^cagione~) in the 
poem; it occurs four times in 44 lines, at vv. 61, 67, 83, and 104, 
thus underlining the centrality of this concern, to understand the root 
of human sinfulness, essential to the understanding of the concept of 
free will, as the next passage (Marco's rejoinder) and the next canto, 
when Virgil discourses on the nature of love, will both make plain.

	|64-66.~  Marco's earlier view of human depravity is obviously now 
deepened by the knowledge that most humans are not very bright, either, 
if even this specially selected mortal can ask such a stupid question.

	|67-129.~  Marco's speech, the only object of possible attention in 
the darkness, twenty-one ^terzine~ of moral philosophy, may be 
paraphrased as follows: If the heavens moved all things, there would be 
no free will; even if they did, you would still have the power to 
resist and conquer (67-78); to a greater power and better nature than 
the celestial heavens you, free, are subject, and that creates the mind 
[the rational soul] in you, which has nothing to do with those 
revolving spheres (79-83); let me expand: God lovingly created the 
(rational) soul in each of you; at its birth, since it was made by Him, 
even if it is a ^tabula rasa~, it loves; and it loves anything at all 
if it is not guided or restrained; therefore, a leader and laws are 
necessary (84-96); laws exist, but who administers them? no one, 
because the pope is involved in temporal affairs and thus gives the 
wrong example that is much imitated (97-102); thus you can see that bad 
guidance and not corrupt human nature accounts for the wickedness of 
the world; Rome, which once made the world good, used then to have two 
suns which lit each path, secular and sacred (103-108); now, since the 
regal and pastoral functions have been conjoined, ill ensues -- by 
their fruits shall you know them (109-114); in northern Italy, which 
once was the home of courtesy and valor before the Church opposed 
Frederick II, there are now but three good men, all of them old 
(115-126); thus you must make it known that the Church of Rome is 
befouled and befouling, arrogating unto itself both governments 
(127-129).

	|67-78.~  Marco's immediate and angry response (but his anger is meant 
to be taken as virtuous, as the righteous indignation of the just) lays 
the issue bare.  'The fault is in the stars' was an earlier day's way 
of claiming 'the dog [or computer] ate my homework' or 'the devil made 
me do it.'  The celestial spheres, forming our tendencies, do incline 
us to various sensuous and sensual activities, but we are not forced to 
follow our appetites, since we have our will to direct our appetites.  
The concept of free will does not receive its full exposition until 
Beatrice's discourse upon it in ^Paradiso~ V.19-84, a moment marked by 
heavy seriousness because this concept lies at the very core of any 
Christian moral assertion.  In Platonic (and Aristotelian) terms, our 
sensitive soul, which responds to such stimuli, is (or should be) 
governed by our rational soul.

	|79-81.~  The great Christian paradox of our free submission to God's 
will stands before the reader here.  Singleton (comm. to verse 80) 
suggests the relevance of Jesus' reference to himself as a yoke to be 
borne by his followers (Matthew 11:29) and Dante's own paradoxical 
formulation, 'iugum libertatis' (the yoke of liberty) in his epistle 
(^Epistle~ VI.5) to the Florentines who were in opposition to the 
emperor (Henry VII) in the autumn of 1310.  God, the greater force and 
better nature, creates the third (rational) soul in us which is ^not~ 
bound by celestial influences.

	|82-84.~  Concluding the grand design of his argument, Marco 
triumphantly puts forward his ^ergo~: any fault that we find when we 
examine human activity lies in us, not in our stars.  And now he will 
expatiate on this paradigmatic equation.

	|85-90.~  The image of the female child (its gender matching that of 
the word ^anima~ [soul]) heedless in her playfulness picks up the train 
of such images of youthful ebullience from the last canto, where the 
sun was disporting himself like a little boy (see the note to ^Purg~. 
XV.1-6).  The rational soul, as yet unknowing, turns to anything that 
delights it without measuring the worth of that delight.

	|91-93.~  This 'ladder' of physically attractive objects, beginning 
with trifling goods, was earlier described by Dante in ^Convivio~ 
IV.xii.14-18, as was apparently first noted by Scartazzini (comm. to 
verse 90), when we begin, as children, longing for an apple, a little 
bird, pretty garments, then a horse, a mistress, riches, then greater 
riches, and finally enormous wealth.  So does the corrupt human soul 
move from childhood to its 'maturity' -- unless such appetites are 
controlled.

	|94-96.~  The 'ruler' that Marco (not to mention Dante) seems to have 
in mind would not appear to be anything but secular.  Some commentators 
recognize how radical an idea this is, while several of them (e.g., 
Benvenuto, Lombardi) simply assume that Dante must here be speaking of 
a religious leader.  But the language is clear: the poet is speaking of 
an emperor who, guiding our race as its leader (the ^guida~ [guide] of 
verse 93) and upholding the laws (the ^fren~ [rein] of that verse), 
will allow us to see at least the tower of the 'true city.'  The 
question of whether this is meant to be understood as the City of God 
on earth or in Heaven, or indeed of an ideal secular city, draws some 
dispute.  Whatever the solution of that part of the riddle, the 
forceful and (at least potentially) disturbing fact is that Dante, in 
search of moral leadership for mankind (rather than for individual 
humans), here looks to the state rather than to the Church.

	|97-99.~  This tercet explains the vigorous and unusual Ghibelline 
turn in the preceding verses.  The laws, left us by Justinian, exist 
but are not enforced.  And this blame is laid upon the Church for 
keeping the emperor from power, since the pope may indeed ruminate, but 
does not distinguish between ecclesiastical and secular power.  Tozer 
(comm. to verse 99) explains the reference as follows: 'The terms here 
used refer to the tests by which beasts were determined to be clean 
under the Mosaic law, i.e., that they should chew the cud and divide 
the hoof (Lev. 11:3).  As applied to the Heads of the Church, the 
allegorical meaning of "chewing the cud" seems to be the acquisition of 
wisdom by pondering on sources of knowledge; but in respect of 
"dividing the hoof" the symbolism is twofold....  First, it signifies 
the practice of good morals,... and it is applied in this sense in vv. 
100-105, where it is explained that it was the unprincipled conduct of 
the Roman Court which had demoralized the world.  Secondly, the 
dividing of the hoof represents the separation of the temporal and 
spiritual powers, which principle the popes had ignored.  This 
interpretation is found in vv. 127-129, where the Church of Rome is 
spoken of as a beast of burden, which falls in the mud in consequence 
of its not distinguishing between these two spheres of government, the 
reference obviously being to the support given to such animals in 
slippery ground by the divided hoof.  The two allegorical applications 
are not wholly unconnected with one another, because it was greed of 
worldly gains which led to the appropriation of the temporal power by 
the Papacy.'

	|100-102.~  The reason that Dante here hopes only for temporal moral 
leadership is now completely clear: the current papacy leads mankind 
only in the example of unbridled appetite.  Thus the Church, which is 
not to interfere with the City of Man on Earth (Augustine's negative 
phrase turned to a Dantean positive), cannot show the way to the City 
of God, either, and that task is turned over, in Dante's asseverations 
here, to the emperor.  It is perhaps impossible to believe that he 
would have written such lines without having Henry VII in mind as the 
one who must accomplish these tasks of leadership.  If Dante is writing 
between 1310 and 1313, it is more than likely that he did.

	|106-108.~  The culminating image in Marco's discourse returns to the 
'good old days' when the early Church and the empire each performed 
their functions separately.

	Dante is here, within the confines of a single tercet, entering 
polemically into one of the great political/theological debates of his 
time, the relative authority of emperor and pope.  Against the 
hierocrats, who warmly supported papal claims to supremacy, Dante 
argues, on the basis of a revision in the hierocrats' central and 
polemical metaphor (pope as 'sun,' emperor as subordinate 'moon'), that 
the two authorities are both supreme and have their authority 
independent of one another, both being established by the direct will 
of God.  Singleton (comm. to verse 106) remembers, in this context, 
Dante's earlier and later precisions (^Conv~. IV.v.3-8; ^Mon~. 
I.xvi.1-2) that when Christ was born under the rule of Augustus the 
world experienced a moment of perfection, what St. Paul calls 
^plenitudinem temporis~ (the fullness of time -- Galatians 4:4).  Dante 
will later develop the metaphor of the 'two suns' in a key chapter of 
^Monarchia~ (III.iv).  (For the date of ^Monarchia~ see the brief 
summary of the debate in Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ (New 
Haven: Yale University Press, 2001)], pp. 150-51.  Most currently 
interested in the problem believe that the work was composed ca. 1317, 
i.e., after the death of Henry VII, and after Dante had composed the 
early cantos of his ^Paradiso~, since in ^Monarchia~ I.xii.6 he says 
'sicut in Paradiso Comoedie iam dixi' [as I have said in the ^Paradiso~ 
of my ^Comedy~], referring to ^Paradiso~ V.19-24).  Scott [^Dante's 
Political Purgatory~ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 
1996)], p. 155, thinks both these passages were written after Pope 
Clement's 'betrayal' of Henry VII, 1312-1313.)

	On the entire subject of the authority of the emperor see the still 
essential work of Ernst Kantorowicz (^The King's Two Bodies~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957]).

	For a passage in St. Gregory Nazianzus's ^De vita sua~ that may have 
caught Dante's attention see Giovanni Farris's article ("I 'due soli' 
[^Pg~. XVI 107] ed una fonte patristica," ^Critica letteraria~ 4 
[1976], pp. 211-16): 'Non autem Natura dedit duo lumina solis / Sed 
Romas dedit illa duas, quae totius orbis / Lampades existunt, Romam 
veteremque novamque: / Hoc inter sese tantum discrimen habentes, / Quod 
videt hanc Phoebus splendere, sed Hesperus illam.'

	|109-114.~  Dante laments the fact that now the Church's pastoral 
crook has taken into itself the imperial sword; his image, though of 
inanimate things, makes the resultant object seem a horrific animate 
hybrid, as does the reference to Matthew 7:16 or 7:20: 'by their fruits 
you shall know them' (words spoken by Jesus to impugn false teachers).

	|115-120.~  Dante's geographical reference is to the northeastern 
sector of Italy, not the territories associated with the presence of 
the emperor Frederick, but Marco's home ground.  For Dante, Frederick 
was the last emperor to take his role as emperor of all Europe 
seriously (see ^Conv~. IV.iii.6, as Pietrobono [comm. to verse 117] 
suggests, where he is described as 'the last emperor of the Romans').  
It may seem strange that Dante should here support the kingship of 
Frederick II, seen among the heretics in hell (^Inf~. X.119).  The 
issue, however, is not Frederick's personal worth, but his rights and 
privileges as emperor.  These were grounds for contention between 
Frederick and the Church throughout his reign (1212-1250).

	|121-126.~  Marco's three ^vecchi~, all still alive in 1300, offer a 
Lombard counterpart to Cacciaguida's forty Florentine families from the 
'good old days' in that city that are listed in ^Paradiso~ XVI: Currado 
da Palazzo, from Brescia; Gherardo da Camino, from Padua; and Guido da 
Castello, from Reggio Emilia.  All three of them had Guelph 
affiliations.  Dante praises the last two in ^Convivio~ when he is 
discussing true nobility (^Conv~. IV.xiv.12; IV.xvi.6).

	|127-129.~  Marco's antipapal charge to Dante will be echoed and 
amplified in that given him by Beatrice in ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.103-105.

	|131-132.~  Dante shows his agreement with Marco's analysis of the 
church/state problem in contemporary Christendom in ancient Hebrew 
terms: the family of Levi, because they were, like the sons of Aaron, 
in a priestly function for Israel, were denied any right to inherit 
land because of their priestly privileges.  See Numbers 18:20-32.

	|133-140.~  The protagonist's ignorance of Gherardo's virtues offers 
Marco (and the poet) a chance to replay the theme of the moment, that 
things are not what they used to be.  The early commentators are 
uncertain whether or not the mention of Gaia is meant to be to her 
praise or blame.  Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 140) and Benvenuto 
(comm. to vv. 139-140) say she was well known as a loose woman.  
However, Benvenuto's self-proclaimed student, John of Serravalle, who 
generally supports his ^maestro~'s opinions, has only good to speak of 
her (and even claims that she wrote vernacular poetry -- [comm. to 
vv.139-141]).  Most modern commentators argue that, since the argument 
at hand is that the old times bore at least some notable virtue while 
the present day is leaden in that respect, it would only make sense for 
Gaia's name to represent a descent from virtue.  The meaning of the 
clause 's'io nol togliessi da sua figlia Gaia' (unless / I were to take 
one [a nickname] from his daughter, Gaia) is, however, problematic.  
According to Torraca (comm. to vv. 139-149) his sobriquet would then be 
'il gaio' (the merry) in recognition of his courtly actions and style 
of being; there is probably no better positive reading of the verse 
than this one.  If we wish to insist on the logically more promising 
negative force of this line, the same descriptive phrase (now only 
meaning 'the father of Gaia') would have the effect of showing how the 
virtues of the father were not found in the daughter.  While the logic 
of this entire sequence calls for such a reading, the feeling in the 
line would seem to support Torraca's currently unfavored reading.  As 
several commentators suggest, until such time as some clearer evidence 
for Dante's opinion of Gaia is unearthed, it is impossible to be sure 
of the tone of the reference, wholehearted or ironic.  The only two 
other uses of the word ^gaio~ in the poem are, however, totally 
positive: see ^Paradiso~ XV.60 and XXVI.102.  Nonetheless, in verse 121 
Dante has Marco refer to only three old men still alive in Lombardy who 
are good.  Since Gaia did not die until 1311, would she not have to be 
considered a ^fourth~ good Lombard (and thus not to be included)?  Or, 
as a woman, is she not allowed inclusion in the paltry list of the 
virtuous?

	|141-145.~  Having walked through the smoke, they have now reached its 
'edge,' and so may soon regain the light of the sun.  Thus we learn 
that Marco and his colleagues in repenting Wrath all must measure their 
pace so as not to walk either too slowly or too quickly in the smoke, 
which is moving clockwise along the terrace.  The smoke does not come 
upon them, as it did Dante and Virgil; they inhabit it.  Marco now 
retreats from the light, having walked too quickly in order to keep 
pace with his new companions.
