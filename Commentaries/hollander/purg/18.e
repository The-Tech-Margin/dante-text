	|1.~  This canto continues the flow of the last with no demarcation in 
the text itself of a terminus or of a new beginning.  As Bosco points 
out in his introductory note to the two cantos, they form a unit 
developed on a chiastic pattern:

\<pre\>
XVII.1-69    (narrative)
                        XVII.70-139 (instruction)
                        XVIII.1-75  (instruction)
XVIII.76-145 (narrative)
\</pre\>

Further, these two cantos form a larger unit with ^Purgatorio~ XVI, 
which is similarly divided into two large blocks of material: 1-63 
(narrative) and 64-145 (Marco's instruction).  In this way the 
numerical center of the ^Commedia~, cantos 49-51, is made more 
noticeable.  (For the midpoint with respect to the number of lines in 
the poem, see the note to ^Purg~. XVII.118-119.)

	Pier Giorgio Ricci ("Il Canto XVIII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove 
letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1970]), p. 252, 
suggests that Dante spreads Virgil's full canto's worth (145 verses) of 
speechifying over two cantos so as not to strain the reader's patience.

	|2-3.~  Virgil's 'Scholastic' credentials seem strong.  See Giuseppe 
Tarozzi's appreciation (^Il canto XVIII del "Purgatorio"~ ["Lectura 
Dantis Orsanmichele"] [Florence: Sansoni, 1901]), p. 7: Virgil 'here 
represents the idealized figure of the medieval docent.'  A close 
analysis of his discourse in the preceding canto, such as may be found, 
in English, in Singleton's commentary, reveals a line of argument that 
is closely based on Thomistic texts.  In keeping with such discourse 
and for the first time since ^Inferno~ XVI.48, Virgil is saluted by his 
pupil as 'professor' (^dottore~).  For the other terms used to describe 
Virgil's role as guide in the poem, see the note to ^Inferno~ II.140.  
(Virgil is referred to as ^dottore~ elsewhere as follows: ^Inf.~  V.70, 
^Inf.~  V.123, ^Inf.~  XVI.13, ^Inf.~  XVI.48, ^Purg.~ XXI.22, ^Purg.~ 
XXI.131, ^Purg.~ XXIV.14).

	In fact, Virgil has rarely been referred to or addressed by Dante with 
such fervent admiration as here and shortly later in this canto, when 
he will be 'padre verace' (true father  --  7), 'Maestro' (Master -- 
10), and then 'father' again (13).  See the note to vv. 17-18.

	|4.~  In this and the next canto the protagonist's forward movement in 
understanding is underlined by the adjective ^nuovo~ (new): used here 
for his new 'thirst,' at verse 141 for his 'new thought' in reaction to 
the departure of the penitents in Sloth, and at ^Purg~. XIX.56, in his 
reference to the new dream he has just had on this terrace.

	|8.~   Dante's 'timid wish' should probably be considered related to 
intellectual sloth (see ^Purg~. XVII.130, ^lento amore~ [laggard 
love]).  How could Dante have considered himself 'timid' in seeking the 
truth?  Had he involved himself in a less than urgent affection for the 
good, the charge would seem appropriate.  Since it is the author who 
makes the charge, it might seem that he himself believed that he did 
not always display the zeal necessary for loving well.

	|13-15.~  Why, one might ask, after Virgil's long speech in the last 
canto, should Dante want Virgil to 'expound' love when he seems just 
now to have finished (with suitable fanfare) doing precisely that?  
What the protagonist means is 'expatiate upon,' 'explain more 
precisely,' the argument just now presented.  The word ^dimostrare~ is 
here, in fact, a verb based on the Latin noun ^demonstratio~, as used 
to refer to the development of proofs by means of syllogistic 
demonstration.  See ^Paradiso~ XXIV.96.

	|17-18.~  Virgil's words reflect Matthew 15:14, where Jesus says that 
the Pharisees are blind guides of the blind who follow them, adding 
that guide and flock shall all end up falling into a ditch.

	In ^Convivio~ I.xi.4 Dante cites this passage, directing its barb 
against 'those wicked Italians who praise the vernacular of others 
while disparaging their own' (^Conv~. I.xi.1) and who are therefore 
likewise headed toward disaster.  As Francesco Mazzoni argues ("Latini, 
Brunetto" [ED.1971.3], p. 580b), in this connection it is difficult not 
to think of Dante's fellow Florentine Brunetto Latini, who wrote his 
encyclopedic ^Tresor~ in French rather than in his native vernacular 
(see Andr$e P$ezard [^Dante sous la pluie de feu~ (Paris: Vrin, 1950)] 
for extensive development of this idea).  Also to be considered are the 
words, written shortly before or shortly after this passage (on the 
problems of dating ^Dve~ and ^Conv.~ see Hollander [^Dante: A Life in 
Works~ (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001)], pp. 54-55), in ^De 
vulgari eloquentia~ I.xiii.1, when Dante 'exiles' Brunetto from the 
illustrious and courtly vernacular that he is championing, relegating 
him to the ash heap of the municipal vernacular, the 'street talk' that 
is to be avoided by serious poets.  In what seems to have been a change 
of heart, Brunetto, in the fifteenth canto of ^Inferno~, will be 
treated generously as Dante's vernacular 'teacher' (^Inf.~  XV.85), 
just as Virgil was his first Latin guide.  It seems clear that these 
two are joined only by Guido Guinizzelli as explicitly paternal figures 
of writerly authority for the Tuscan poet.

	Dante refers to, whether as protagonist or as poet, various 'fathers' 
in the course of the poem (this is to exclude 'fathers' addressed by 
other characters).  Of those listed below, those numbered 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 
are only addressed or referred to once; all the others have at least 
two other paternal moments for Dante, except for St. Bernard, who has 
only one other; Virgil leads all 'fathers' with a dozen other 
occurrences.  Of these twelve 'fathers,' seven are addressed, those 
numbered 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.  The parenthetic reference is to the 
first appearance of each 'father.'

   (1) Virgil (^Inf~. VIII.110)
   (2) Brunetto Latini (^Inf~. XV.83)
   (3) Cato of Utica (^Purg~. I.33)
   (4) Guido Guinizzelli (^Purg~. XXVI.97)
   (5) God (addressed as 'good Apollo,' ^Par~. I.28)
   (6) St. Francis (^Par~. XI.85)
   (7) Cacciaguida (^Par~. XVI.16)
   (8) St. Benedict (^Par~. XXII.58)
   (9) the sun (^Par~. XXII.116)
   (10) St. Peter (^Par~. XXIV.62)
   (11) Adam (^Par~. XXVI.92)
   (12) St. Bernard (^Par~. XXXI.63)

Frank Ordiway's lengthy article, "Brunetto and Dante," completed in 
draft ca. 1992 but still under revision, offers detailed analysis of 
the program of Dante's 'fathers' in the poem.  See, for his first 
treatment of this material, his doctoral dissertation (^Dante, Chaucer, 
and the Poetics of the Past~ [unpublished doctoral dissertation, 
Princeton University, 1990]).

	|19-21.~  Virgil, responding to Dante's request, carries his analysis 
of the loving human mind to the next level, the role of the rational 
soul in determining human choice and, therefore, action.  This tercet 
establishes the subject of Virgil's difficult clarification (vv. 
22-39): how mind (the rational soul, created directly by God and 
instilled in the embryo last [see ^Purg~. XXV.67-75]) reacts 
appetitively to external things.

	|22-27.~   The ^apprensiva~ (power of perception), already implicitly 
referred to in Dante's apostrophe of the ^imaginativa~ (faculty of 
imagination) in ^Purgatorio~ XVII.13-15, is the faculty of perception 
that reacts to the capturing of an image (referred to here as an 
^intenzione~) of external reality in the ^imaginazione~ or ^fantasia~ 
(see the note to verse 13-18).  The mind, as opposed to the 'natural 
desire' of the senses (see ^Purg~. XVII.93 for this distinction), which 
is always errorless, is responsible for its choices and may err.  If 
its perception inclines toward what it contemplates, that is what we 
call love.

	For a discussion of this passage in light of the Aristotelian and 
Arabic roots of Dante's word ^intenzione~, see the entry for that term 
by Tullio Gregory (ED.1971.3), pp. 480b-481b.

	|28-33.~  Desire, love in action, now continues by extending toward 
its goal and remaining in this state as long as it takes pleasure in 
its appetition.  (For fire as an example of 'natural desire,' see the 
note to ^Purg~. XVII.91-92.)  Thus here Dante is comparing intellectual 
desire to natural desire, but also insisting on the distance between 
them.  Natural desire can never be culpable (e.g., fire always 
'desires' to rise -- that is its natural inclination).  There is 
perhaps no moment in the poem of greater danger to its essential 
philosophical position.  Is human desire -- for money, food, or sexual 
pleasure -- not as 'natural' as this?  Does anyone ^not~ desire these 
things?  Dante's attempt to persuade us, as he may well have realized, 
reflects that of another ^dottore~ and ^maestro~, Jesus.  He, as the 
Gospels amply testify, also spoke frequently, in his parables, in terms 
of human desires that all could understand, e.g., of money, 
agriculture, marriage.  In all cases the listener is encouraged, even 
impelled, to understand that such pleasures, as great as they may be, 
will seem as nothing compared to the joys of Heaven.

	Padoan ("^Purgatorio~ Canto XVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ 
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1964)]), pp. 668-70, suggests that Dante's 
definition of love in this canto intrinsically corrects Francesca's 
claims for the ineluctable nature of passionate love (^Inf~. V.103).

	Dante was surely right to let his language here reflect an essentially 
sexual view of love.  Consider the last verse of this part of the 
passage, 'fin che la cosa amata il fa gioire' (as long as it enjoys the 
thing it loves [for this understanding of the conjunction ^fin che~ see 
Francesco Mazzoni, cited by Bosco/Reggio in their commentary on this 
passage; in opposition, reading 'until it attains the thing it loves' 
as being more Thomistic, see Alfred A. Triolo (^Purgatorio~ XVIII," in 
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. 
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, 
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 268]).  Arriving at 
this point in the argument, a reader would have to be pardoned for 
believing that whatever good the spirit of love pursues is ^ipso facto~ 
good, just as the protagonist himself will shortly seem to believe (vv. 
43-45).  But what is the nature of the 'moto spiritale' (movement of 
the spirit) of the 'captive mind'?  That question is reflected in the 
crucial and concluding portion of Virgil's discourse.

	|34-39.~  The main candidates for this unenviable denomination, the 
errant folk who believe that ^all~ love is good (a proposition, as we 
have seen, that we might have considered unassailable a moment ago), 
have been Epicureans.  In the modern period this view is first offered 
by Scartazzini (comm. to verse 35) but then is held by many 
twentieth-century commentators.  Grabher (comm. to vv. 19-39) is of the 
opinion that this is the position of all love poets, including the 
younger Dante.  His view, sometimes combined with that of Scartazzini, 
has grown increasingly attractive to recent commentators.  Clearly, 
anyone who believes that love is in itself and always praiseworthy is 
among this group.

	The 'imprint' on the 'wax' of our love becomes the crucial symbolic 
expression of the concept developed here.  The 'wax' clearly refers to 
the innate human potential to love, which is 'stamped' by the image 
that the mind has extracted from reality; that 'stamp' may either be 
worthy or unworthy, while the 'wax' is always worthy.

	|40-45.~  It is, despite Virgil's last insistence on the (implicit) 
need for the proper exercise of the free will in choosing the objects 
of one's desire, understandable that Dante, up to this point, believes 
that the mind is completely responsive to internalized (by the 
^apprensiva~) external stimuli (the ^intenzione~ -- see verse 23), and 
thus irreprehensible in whatever choice it makes.

	|46-48.~  This passage offers perhaps the only apparently material 
evidence in the poem that would tie both Virgil and Beatrice to an 
allegorical status, his role being that of Reason, hers, Faith.  But 
see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura 
Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990]), p. 42, n. 2: 'It is from Virgil's lips 
that we first hear the name Beatrice... in ^Purgatorio~: VI.46; XV.77; 
XVIII.48.  In her first three nominal presences in this ^cantica~... 
she is associated first with hope (VI.32), then with love (XV.68; 
XV.71; XV,74), then with faith.'  Thus associated with the three 
theological virtues, Beatrice can be seen as possessing all of them; 
she probably should not be seen as representing any one of them, or as 
having an 'allegorical' status in this poem.

	In keeping with all of the ratiocination found in this canto, words 
for 'reason' in various noun and verb forms are found in it far more 
than in any other (^Purg~. XXII finishes a distant second with four 
occurrences), as follows: vv. 1, 12, 46, 65, 67, 85, 120.

	|49-75.~  The three cantos at the center of ^Purgatorio~ devote what 
may seem immoderate space to what Benedetto Croce disliked in Dante, 
his 'non-poesia,' his 'structure,' his mere ^allotria~ (the 'extraneous 
matter' of philosophy or theology that Croce deprecated in Dante; 
opposing such views, Fernando Salsano ["^Purgatorio~ Canto XV," in 
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967)], p. 542, 
speaks of the ^Comedy~ as 'un poema e non un libro di poesie').  For an 
examination of what Croce's kind of aestheticizing denies to Dante's 
poem, precisely the validity and beauty of its conceptual structure, 
see Giorgio Stabile ("Cosmologia e teologia nella ^Commedia~: la caduta 
di Lucifero e il rovesciamento del mondo," ^Letture classensi~ 12 
[1983]), pp. 139-44.  Stabile is surely correct in arguing that Croce's 
oppositional binome structure/poetry fails to account for the 
^aesthetic~ possibilities of Dante's versified conceptual thinking.  
Marco's long speech in XVI (65-129), Virgil's in XVII (91-139), and 
Virgil's concluding two in this canto (16-39; 49-75) should be looked 
upon, as should the related discursive portions of Cantos XXIV and XXV, 
as part of a continuing development of a complex statement about the 
nature and function of love, presented from different vantage points.  
In Canto XXIV, Dante's presentation of the Holy Spirit's creative role 
in helping to make the writings of a handful of poets acceptable to God 
prepares for the following treatment in Canto XXV of the way the Holy 
Spirit is breathed into all of us, thus explaining how eventually a 
very few of us may become acceptable to God as His saints in paradise.  
In these three cantos Marco the Lombard explains the need for proper 
civil governance because our free will may elsewise lead us astray, 
while Virgil takes up a related topic, the need for us individually to 
use our free will correctly in choosing and responding to the objects 
of our attention and affection.

	|49-60.~  The only 'substantial form' to be both distinct from matter 
and joined to it is the human soul, which is formed by pure divine 
intellect (as are the angels) and by emotional and vegetative powers 
(as are the beasts).  Its ^specifica vertute~ (defining disposition), 
as we learn at vv. 55-57, is composed of primal intellect and primal 
will, and is only perceptible in the action of the soul, not in itself. 
 Now, leaving intellection out of consideration, Virgil continues: We 
have no recollection or current understanding of our original 
inclination (to love God), yet we do demonstrate its presence in us, as 
the eagerness of bees for making honey reveals their 'defining 
disposition.'  This kind of (natural) will exists beyond and before 
moral assent.

	|61-66.~  This innate will (see ^Purg~. XXI.105, ^la virt@u che 
vuole~ [the power that wills]) must accord with ^la virt@u che 
consiglia~ ('the faculty that counsels'), the higher intellect that 
should govern all our choices; our ability to choose good and to 
discard wrongful affections is the ground for the measurement of our 
moral condition.

	|67-69.~  Aristotle's ^Ethics~ is probably Dante's main source for his 
views on morality (a view supported by Benvenuto da Imola [comm. to vv. 
67-75]).  However, to account for the plurality of the reference, 
Poletto (comm. to these verses) sensibly refers to Dante's own earlier 
phrasing (found in the words of his guide, Virgil), 'I speak of 
Aristotle and of Plato / and of many others' (^Purg~. III.43-44).

	|70-75.~  Virgil's lengthy discourse concludes with his final 
insistence on the pivotal role of free will in individual moral 
responsibility and looks forward (as Benvenuto was perhaps the first to 
realize [see his comm. to vv. 67-75]) to Beatrice's remarks on the 
subject in ^Paradiso~ V.19-24, asseverating that the freedom of the 
will is the greatest of God's gifts to humankind.  Many of the early 
commentators find this a convenient place for them to reassert the 
'allegorical' valence of Beatrice, here interpreted as 'Theology.'  In 
the past 150 years most commentators are content to leave the 
allegorical equation in abeyance, merely referring to Beatrice as 
herself.

	|76-81.~  Returning to narrative, the poet returns to telling the 
time.  The moon, as the slowest 'planet' in Dante's astronomy, is 
fittingly the celestial body referred to on the terrace of Sloth.  Its 
appearance is compared by Benvenuto (comm. to these lines) to the 
semicircular fire in a lighthouse, glowing throughout the night.  
Commentators are divided as to exactly what is involved here, i.e., 
whether it is the moon's rising that is referred to or its current 
position in the sky.  Singleton's discussion (comm. to vv. 76-78) 
resuscitates Edward Moore's early essay (^The Time References in the 
"Divina Commedia"~ [London 1887]) to support the notion that there is 
no reference here to moonrise (the cause of endless resultant debate in 
the commentaries about the precise hour that would then be indicated), 
but to the moon being high enough in the sky to dim the brightness of 
the stars at the approach of midnight.

	The moon, Dante would seem to be saying, was roughly on the same path 
taken by the sun when it sets in the southwest (when seen from Rome) in 
late November, between Sardinia and Corsica.

	|82-84.~  The protagonist's gratitude to Virgil is expressed with a 
salute to his birthplace, Pietola ('Andes' in Roman times).  Some early 
commentators read the phrase 'pi@u che villa mantoana' to mean 
'more than the city Mantua,' while the meaning is nearly certainly 
'more than any Mantuan town,' i.e., any other town in the vicinity of 
the city, not Mantua itself, as Padoan ("^Purgatorio~ Canto XVIII," in 
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1964)]), p. 
688n., agrees.

	|87-88.~  Again a detail -- Dante's somnolence -- establishes a 
connection with Sloth.

	|89-90.~  These penitents, as opposed to the wrathful, move in the 
same counterclockwise direction that is followed by Dante and Virgil.  
It would seem that, while the movement of Dante to the right is morally 
determined, that of the penitents is not, is rather the result of 
aesthetic considerations.  Review of the various groups that are in 
motion suggests that such is the case. Below the gate, we see that the 
excommunicate are moving rightwards (^Purg~. III.59), while the 
late-repentant seem to be heading to the left (^Purg~. V.23).  On the 
terraces, the prideful seem to be moving right (^Purg~. X.100), while 
the wrathful are headed left (^Purg~. XV.142).  Here in Sloth the 
penitents come from behind Virgil and Dante but are moving in the same 
direction (^Purg~. XVIII.90).  Farther up the mountain the penitent 
gluttons are also moving counterclockwise (^Purg~. XXIII.19-20), while 
the two distinct bands of the lustful proceed in two different 
directions (^Purg~. XXVI.29).

	|91-96.~  This is a fairly rare occurrence in ^Purgatorio~, a simile 
based explicitly on classical materials (but see ^Purg~. IX.34-42, for 
the similetic reference to Statius's Achilles).  And there will not be 
another (now based on a passage in Lucan) until ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.64-69.

	Ismenus and Asopus are names of rivers, the first flowing through the 
city of Thebes, the second near it.  Beginning with Jacopo della Lana 
(comm. to these verses), commentators have offered the opinion, from 
time to time, that Dante's source here is Statius (^Thebaid~ IX).  
Ismenos is named at IX.404, his 'brother' Asopos at IX.449.  That 
passage includes two references to the orgiastic Bacchic rites 
(IX.434-436; 478-480) to which Dante here refers.

	|97-98.~  Running in a group to counteract the painful memory of their 
solitary slothful behaviors on earth, all these gathered penitents may 
put contemporary readers in mind of the massed crowds of runners in 
metropolitan marathons.

	|99-138.~  With the exception of the concluding interaction with the 
angel in the following canto, separated by Dante's sleep and dream from 
the action on the fourth terrace, all the usual 'events' of any terrace 
are here condensed -- in the compressed style appropriate to the 
description of the newly zealous -- into these forty verses.  All 
terraces include the following features in the same order: (1) 
description of the physical aspect of the terrace, (2) exemplars of the 
countering virtue, (3) description of the penitents, (4) recitation of 
their sins by particular penitents, (5) exemplars of the vice, (6) 
appearance to Dante of the angel representing the opposing virtue.

	We might want to reflect on the extraordinary artisanship of the 
presentation of the exemplary material on the earlier terraces, things 
not matched by what we find in earlier medieval poems: the 'speaking' 
(and odoriferous) intaglios of Pride, the voices streaking overhead in 
Envy, the ecstatic visions of Wrath.  It is as though Dante had used up 
all the brilliant new techniques of presentation of which he could 
think and now, for the rest of the ascent, subsides to the perfectly 
acceptable artistic level of utterance, leaving us to marvel at what he 
had done before.  On three of the last four terraces the names 
(sometimes accompanied by reference to significant deeds) of all 
exemplary figures are simply called out by the penitents, while on the 
terrace of Gluttony, in a variant, the two trees do the talking.

	|99-102.~  Petrocchi's punctuation of this passage and of that devoted 
to the final exemplary figures, vv. 133-138, is probably not well 
conceived.  Since there are two voices speaking, and since each pair of 
examples is divided by the copulative 'e' (and), it seems nearly 
certain that each voice recites a single example.  Thus the 'e' in both 
passages should, alone, be outside quotation marks, thus marking each 
of the two statements as being registered by a different voice.  
Otherwise, what use was there in having ^two~ anonymous voices giving 
the examples?  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 99) points out that the 
first two speakers, by virtue of leading the pack, are intrinsically 
the 'fastest' and thus most qualified to offer the positive ^exempla~, 
while the last two, bringing up the rear, most appropriately give forth 
the negative ones.  See also Pier Giorgio Ricci ("Il Canto XVIII del 
^Purgatorio~," in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1970]), pp. 260-63, discussing the paired voices and the 
problem with the punctuation adopted by Petrocchi.

	Some of the earliest commentators believe that the reference is to the 
precipitous escape from Herod's decree and the flight of the holy 
family into Egypt (a misinterpretation that surfaced again in the 
Renaissance in the commentaries of Landino and Vellutello).  However, 
beginning with Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to verse 100) the 
obvious citation of Luke 1:39 has been recognized as governing this 
example.  Mary, having been told by Gabriel during the Annunciation of 
Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy in her old age (which will result in 
the birth of John the Baptist), 'abiit in montana cum festinatione... 
et salutavit Elisabeth' (went with good speed into the hill country... 
and offered her salutation to Elizabeth).

	|101-102.~   The Roman example paired with Mary is none other than 
Julius Caesar.  It is notable that in Lucan (^Phars~. III.453) Caesar's 
rushing off to do battle in Spain is not the result of military 
strategy but of his being bored (^inpatiens~) with the prolonged 
efforts to lay siege to Marseilles.  Further, his eventual victory at 
Lerida is described by Lucan as being the result of fortunate changes 
in the weather (^Phars~. IV.48-49).  Thus Dante's praise of him here is 
clearly at odds with Lucan's (always) withering scorn for the Great Man 
whom he so desperately despises.  For the entire question of Dante's 
divided view of Julius Caesar, in one view the first, God-sent emperor 
of Rome, in another the destroyer of the Republic and of Roman virtue, 
see Stull and Hollander ("The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)]), pp. 33-43.  This is one of 
Julius's few positive moments in Dante's poem; and Dante needed to 
disregard Lucan's views in order to present him favorably.  John of 
Serravalle's gloss (to vv. 97-102) might have pleased him: 'Cesar fuit 
recte inimicus accidie, fuit valde sollicitus.  Semper dicebat 
militibus: Venite; nunquam dixit: Ite' (Caesar was indeed an enemy to 
sloth, a pronouncedly zealous one at that.  He was always calling to 
his soldiers 'Come' and never once said 'Go').  For Dante's previous 
and next far less favorable references to Julius, see the notes to 
^Purgatorio~ IX.133-138 and XXVI.76-78.

	|103.~  On every other terrace the penitents have a prayer that they 
speak in common when they are not interrupted by other forms of 
observance or by conversation with Dante and Virgil (see ^Purg~. 
XI.1-24; XIII.50-51; XVI.19; XIX.73; XXIII.11; XXV.121).  The terrace 
of Sloth offers the only exception, as though the previous ^acedia~ of 
these penitents took from them the privilege of Christian prayer.  The 
gloss of Carroll (to vv. 103-105) is interesting: 'The idea seems... to 
be the danger of contemplation of good deeds, without an eager and 
immediate effort to imitate them.  Mere "study" of them may end in the 
"little love" which produces sloth.  It is only when "study" is 
accompanied by action that it "makes grace bud again.''  For Dante, a 
man devoted to the pursuit of the morally engaged active life, certain 
occasions for prayer perhaps appeared to offer a potential escape from 
one's civil and religious duty in the world.  Men and women of such 
disposition are thus, here in their penitence, denied the comfort of 
prayer until such time as prayer will be totally zealous, not the 
occasion for a moment of repose from worldly responsibility or, for 
that matter, from proper monastic exertion.  ^Acedia~ was frequently 
associated with improper monastic ^otium~, a withdrawal from the world 
but from one's duty to God, as well, surely a great temptation in the 
relative ease allowed by monastic life.'

	|104-105.~  The phrase 'per poco amor' (for lack of love) and the word 
'studio' (the Italian equivalent of the Latin word for 'zeal') combine 
to underline the defining vice and virtue of this terrace.

	|107.~  Virgil's 'perhaps' is a gentle act of ^politesse~ on his part: 
these penitents were guilty of precisely what he describes.

	|113-117.~  The extreme courtesy of this speaker cancels whatever 
thoughts of ^villania~ (discourtesy) Dante or we might have.  His 
identity -- such as it is -- will be revealed immediately.

	|118-120.~  San Zeno, just outside the city of Verona (and, by common 
consent, one of the most beautiful churches in Italy), was also the 
site of a monastery.  Its nameless abbot, who speaks here, is generally 
identified as Gherardo II, who served, during the reign of the Emperor 
Frederick I, from 1163 until his death in 1187.  Frederick Barbarossa, 
emperor (from 1152 until his death in 1190) as Frederick I, was a 
grandfather of Frederick II (emperor 1215-1250).  Dante's overall 
opinion of him is difficult to measure, since he so rarely refers to 
him, but in the two passages that do invoke his presence, here and in 
^Epistle~ VI.20, his destruction of Milan in 1162 for its anti-imperial 
activities is clearly applauded.  On the question of Dante's views of 
Barbarossa see Bruno Nardi ("Dante e il buon Barbarossa," ^L'Alighieri~ 
7 [1966], pp. 3-27).

	For the less than likely possibility that the adjective 'buon' (good) 
that precedes his name is here to be taken ironically, see Tommaseo's 
commentary to this passage.  One may add that the thirty occasions in 
the ^Commedia~ on which a reader finds the epithet combined with a name 
or title (e.g., 'buon Marzucco,' 'buon maestro') do not reveal a single 
one in which an ironic reading seems warranted.

	|121-126.~  Dante, welcomed by the Scaligeri family to Verona in 
1303-4, there enjoyed the first happy time of his exile.  His memories 
of those rulers of the city give rise to a ^post-eventum~ prophecy.  
Alberto della Scala was lord of Verona until his death in 1301, by 
which time he had appointed his lame, illegitimate son, Giuseppe 
(1263-1313), to serve as abbot of the monastery (in 1292), for the rest 
of his days.  Alberto was succeeded by his eldest legitimate son, 
Bartolommeo, nearly certainly Dante's first host in Verona.  Upon 
Bartolommeo's death, in 1304, Alberto's second son, Alboino, became 
lord (many believe that Dante and Alboino did not get along, thus 
explaining Dante's departure from Verona ca. 1304), a position he held 
until his death in 1311, when he was succeeded by Cangrande della 
Scala, the third legitimate son and Dante's patron and host when the 
poet returned to Verona ca. 1314.

	|127-129.~  The nameless abbot is moving so quickly that Dante cannot 
tell whether he has finished speaking or has simply moved too far ahead 
to be heard while continuing to speak -- a nice final touch to convey 
the zeal with which he is exercising his penitence.

	|131-132.~  For the reason that there are two anonymous speakers and 
for the probable punctuation of vv. 133-138, see the note to vv. 99-102.

	|133-135.~  The first example of the sin of Sloth indicates the 
Hebrews who, having made the passage through the Red Sea, grew restive 
under Moses' guidance and died of plague before the completed exodus 
across Jordan into the Promised Land accomplished only by Joshua and 
Caleb.  See Numbers 14:1-38 and Deuteronomy 1:26-40.

	|136-138.~  Similarly, some of Aeneas's companions, egged on by Iris, 
disguised as the wife of Doryclus, rebelled against the leadership of 
Aeneas and chose to remain in Sicily.  The matrons set fire to the 
ships and Aeneas, having saved all but four of them from destruction, 
allows all who wish to stay behind to do so (^Aen~. V.604-761).  
Giorgio Padoan ("^Purgatorio~ Canto XVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1964)]), p. 686, argues that 
Dante's treatment of ^Aeneid~ V here differs from that found in 
^Convivio~ IV.xxvi.11, but the difference can be explained by the fact 
that in the earlier passage Dante focuses on the willingness of Aeneas 
to allow the discouraged to stay behind found in Virgil's text itself, 
while here he judges the malingerers from a different vantage point, 
the divinely sanctioned imperative to found new Troy in Latium.

	This discussion is part of a wider one (pp. 680-88), which returns to 
Padoan's earlier attempts to alert the reader to the question of which 
allegorical understanding of the ^Aeneid~ governs the reading of Virgil 
that is manifest in the ^Commedia~.  It is possible that, despite such 
earlier allegorical formulations of the meaning of Virgil's epic as are 
found in ^Convivio~ IV.xxvi.8-9 (or, for Lucan's epic, in ^Conv~. 
IV.xxviii.13-19), Dante had turned his back on philological allegory as 
the key to anything central in the ^Aeneid~, and read the poem 
historically, much as he wanted his own poem to be read.  For this 
argument see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 78-94, citing D.L.M. Drew's 
previous arguments for a 'non-allegorical' ^Aeneid~ (p. 81n.).

	|141-142.~  The protagonist's ^novo pensiero~ (new thought) has 
puzzled his commentators.  Is it one triggered by what he has seen and 
heard?  Or is he anticipating the matters he will rehearse in his dream 
in the next canto?  Or is the poet merely describing, generically, the 
way in which the mind works as it flits from subject to subject on the 
way to sleep (a view that is much present in the commentaries)?  In the 
next canto, a similar phrase will refer to a mental image already 
experienced (the ^novella vis,ion~ of XIX.56) in his previous 
dream.  Thus here it is at least possible that the 'new thought' is a 
response to what he has seen or heard.  Could he have wondered whether 
he was himself more like the backsliding Hebrews and Trojans than he is 
like Joshua or Aeneas?  This would seem possible, but not demonstrable. 
 In any case, this unreported thought leads to still others, and these 
are clearly -- because the text tells us so -- the matter of his dream.

	|143.~  The verb Dante uses to describe his floating state of 
consciousness, ^vaneggiai~ (rambled), picks up an earlier phrasing, 
when he compares himself to one who ^sonnolento vana~ (rambles in his 
drowsy mind -- verse 87) after Virgil has finished his explanation of 
love and free will.  There he is falling into a fatigue that mirrors 
the sin purged on this terrace.  Here he finally gives in to that 
weight of somnolence.

	|145.~  Dante's purgatorial dreams are described in cantos IX, XIX, 
and XXVII, but the second occurs here, in a single line, 'e 'l 
pensamento in sogno trasmutai' (and I transformed my musings into 
dream).  Since in ^Vita nuova~ he presents his age as having been nine, 
eighteen, and twenty-seven for his three main 'encounters' with 
Beatrice, the poet perhaps wanted to retain those three nine-based and 
nine-spaced numbers for his three dreams that lead back to her now.  
For this calculation see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), p. 145.
