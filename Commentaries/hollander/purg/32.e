	|1-3.~  Dante would seem to be looking back in time, seeing Beatrice
now, in 1300, as she was in Florence in 1290 (the year in which she
died).  That his eyes are so 'fixed' will be noted by the theological
virtues at verse 9 -- and not with approval.

	This is the longest canto in the ^Comedy~.  For consideration of the
various lengths of Dante's cantos, see the note to ^Inferno~ VI.28-32.

	|4-6.~  The love that Dante feels now for Beatrice is described in
terms that indicate its 'Carthaginian' dimension.  The 'antica rete'
(old, familiar net) reminds us of the 'antica fiamma' (ancient flame --
^Purg~. XXX.48) that flared in Dido and then in Dante, Dido's words
become his own.  Dante's morals may have been cleansed on the mountain,
and Lethe may have made him forget his now forgiven sins, but his
intellect is surely not working at its highest level.  Having seen
Beatrice as God loves her, he still contrives to think she is that
pretty girl from Florence.  The poet records her 'holy smile'; the
protagonist remembers his earthly feelings.

	The word ^rete~ (net) was used in the last canto (^Purg~. XXXI.63) to
denote the instrument with which a hunter catches birds (as a girl [or
girls] caught incautious Dante, according to Beatrice), and may also
remind us of the net in which Vulcan caught his adulterous wife Venus
^in flagrante delicto~ with Mars, as Allen Tate ("The Symbolic
Imagination: A Meditation on Dante's Three Mirrors," in ^Discussions of
the "Divine Comedy,"~ ed. Irma Brandeis [Boston: Heath, 1961]), p. 103,
has suggested.

	|8.~  Dante, facing Beatrice, the griffin, and the front of the
chariot, turns to his left to pay attention to the three theological
virtues, facing him as they stand at the chariot's right wheel (see
^Purg~. XXIX.121).

	|9.~  How can Dante love Beatrice too much?  Only if he does not love
her in God.  And that, we should realize, is why he is rebuked here by
the theological virtues (not the least of them being Charity), who
understand that his gaze is fixed on the image of the young woman he
loved and lost rather than on the saved soul who has made his journey
possible.  (See the note to ^Purg~. XXX.58.)  The problem is as old as
Plato's ^Phaedrus~.  How do we love physical beauty in such ways as to
see it as only the manifestation of a higher beauty (in Dante, of the
^etterno piacer~ [^Purg~. XXIX.32])?  See Mazzeo's "Dante and the
^Phaedrus~ Tradition of Poetic Inspiration" (in his ^Structure and
Thought in the "Paradiso"~ [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1958],
pp. 1-24).  The virtues intercede because they sense that Dante is
caught up in carnal appreciation of a spiritual entity.

	|13-15.~  The poet at first may seem to be making exactly the same
sort of mistake the protagonist has just made, a second idolatrous
praising of his lady who, he now seems to be saying, is of even greater
worth than the entirety of the Church Triumphant (or so Singleton
[comm. to these verses] implies, referring to these 'strong words,
calling the whole procession 'poco' in comparison!').

	The passage has caused difficulty over the years.  The partial
insights of several help us make sense of what Dante said.  John of
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 10-18) points out that the word ^sensibile~ is
a technical term, reflecting such discussions as those found in
Aristotle (^De anima~ II and ^De senso et sensato~).  The sensation
encountered by any particular sense organ is what is meant, and the
commentator's first example fits perfectly here.  If one looks at the
sun (a ^sensibile~, an object of sense perception, in this case by the
eyes), anything else will seem less bright by comparison (see the
discussion of the ^sensibile comune~ [the objects of sensory
perception] in the note to ^Purg~. XXIX.47-51).  Tozer (comm. to these
verses) reminds the reader of the similar passage at ^Purgatorio~
XV.15, in which Dante's sense of sight is overwhelmed.  And Steiner
(comm. to vv. 13-14) distinguishes between the light of the sun and the
blinding effulgence of God.

	The context here is the 'isplendor di viva luce etterna' (splendor of
eternal living light), that is, the smile of Beatrice glowing with the
direct light of God's rays.  Her mouth is illumined by the 'sun' that
is God, while all else in the garden is lit by the light of the natural
sun, and thus is less available to the sense of sight than Beatrice's
smile, as vv. 10-12 make all but apparent: Dante has been blinded by
the Light.

	|16-18.~  The Church, in metaphor a 'glorious army,' has reversed its
course, is heading back toward the east, whence it came.  In this poem,
until we hear the penitents cry out in joy for the liberation of
Statius's soul (^Purg~. XX.136), the words ^gloria~ and ^glor,ioso~
have referred to worldly fame.  But here, as there, the word has the
meaning it will have in ^Paradiso~, referring to those who live in
Glory, that is, in the shining effulgence of God.  (The American
nineteenth-century locution 'going to glory' meant 'headed for
heaven.')  This army is not famous for its worldly accomplishments; it
dwells with God and does not care for the world's rewards.  The word
'glory' has 25 of its 39 occurrences in the poem in ^Paradiso~; thus
nearly two-thirds of them are found in one-third of the available
poetic space.

	|19-24.~  The elaborate military simile, in which the vanguard of the
Church Triumphant had turned and was already moving eastward while the
chariot was still facing west (an effect striven for and achieved by
marching bands between the halves of American football games) may have
an ulterior purpose.  Dante has reversed temporal order to present
first the Church in triumph as it will be after time, and only then the
Church in its earthly travail (see the note to ^Purg~. XXIX.115-120).
As preparation for that change, from Church Triumphant to Church
Militant, he may have chosen this introductory military simile, one in
which the forces with which we identify are under attack and in
strategic retreat.

	|27.~  Benvenuto's gloss (comm. to vv. 25-27) suggests that, while the
mortal aspect of Christ may be mutable, His divine being (represented
by his wings) is not.

	|28-30.~  Matelda, Statius, and Dante are at the right wheel of the
chariot, since that is the one that turns in the smaller arc, given the
fact that the 'army' has turned to its right in its retreat.  Statius's
presence has not been referred to since ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.146 and his
name has not been heard since ^Purgatorio~ XXVII.47.  He is named a
total of eight times between cantos XXI and XXXIII of this ^cantica~,
this being the seventh; nonetheless, his presence almost always catches
us by surprise.

	|31-37.~  If paradise has been regained in this Eden, it is now time
to consider how it was lost in the first place; the usual suspects are
Eve and Adam (in that order, since she sinned first, but he still more
disastrously).  Eve is referred to periphrastically by the poet (verse
32), but it is Adam's name that is murmured by all the others present
in the procession.

	That the procession has paused, with Beatrice descending from the
chariot, indicates that we have arrived at a 'destination' of some
importance.

	|38-42.~  The tree, given the context, is, literally, the Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil.  However, some of the first commentators
(e.g., the Anonymus Lombardus [comm. to vv. 38-39], Jacopo della Lana
[comm. to these verses]), disregarding that context, think its withered
condition indicates the Tree of Life after the original sin, when
humankind lost eternal life, a perfectly sensible (if almost certainly
erroneous) conclusion.  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 37-39), paying
attention to what is said of the tree in the next canto (^Purg~.
XXXIII.61-63), only reasonably concludes that this tree, eaten of by
Adam when he followed Eve in sin, must be the Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil.  While there have been many other interpretations
(Scartazzini comm. to verse 38] claims that not a single gloss but a
book would be necessary to document them all -- and indeed his gloss
itself is article-length), most currently agree with Benvenuto, but
also with Scartazzini's view that the allegorical sense of the tree
relates it to the history of the Roman empire. For the current debate
over the meaning of the tree, see Armour (^Dante's Griffin and the
History of the World: A Study of the Earthly Paradise ["Purgatorio"
XXIX-XXXIII]~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1989]), pp. 180-214, and Pertile (^La
puttana e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di
Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), pp. 163-96; see also Kaske ("'S@i
si conserva il seme d'ogne giusto' [^Purg~. XXXII, 48]," ^Dante
Studies~ 89 [1971]), p. 50.

	One literary source of Dante's tree, which, as Scartazzini and Pertile
point out, has any number of biblical analogues (e.g., Judges 9:8,
Ezechiel 17:24, Daniel 4:20-22; Pertile, p. 166: Song of Songs 7:7-8),
was first suggested by John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 37-42):
^Georgics~ II.122-124, describing enormously tall trees in India.  We
probably should assume that this tree, like those found on two of the
terraces below (see ^Purg~. XXII.131-135; XXIV.103-105), has its boughs
pointed downward so as to prevent its being climbed.

	|43-48.~  This exchange between the members of the Church Triumphant
and the griffin (his only spoken words in the poem) has puzzled the
commentators, like so much else in this difficult canto.  His faithful
celebrate the griffin's un-Adamic restraint; not only will he not
despoil the tree a second time, he will bring the dead tree back to
life (vv. 58-60).

	The griffin's words, as was first pointed out by Scartazzini (comm. to
verse 48) and now by many another commentator, derive from Matthew
3:15.  Christ insists on being baptized by John the Baptist: 'For so it
becomes us to fulfill all justice.'  That the griffin speaks a version
of the very words of Christ is still further evidence that he is meant
to be understood as representing Him here.

	|51.~  The griffin now binds the ^temo~ (shaft), by means of which he
had been drawing the chariot, to the tree.  Most discussants currently
believe that this instrument represents Christ's cross.  The first
commentators argued that, since Adam's sin had been disobedience, this
scene showed the obedience to which Christ enjoined his Church, a
reasonable enough understanding.  While embracing it, Benvenuto (comm.
to vv. 43-51) reports that some others believe that this ligature is
symbolic of the Incarnation, while still others believe it is related
to the cross.  This last interpretation eventually became dominant, and
remains so today.

	It was only with Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), however, that the
most likely source for this tercet, the fourteenth chapter of the
apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, which Scartazzini claims is also the
source of the lengthy paraphrase found in the gloss to the passage by
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 43-51) came to light.  Any number of
medieval legends were developed from this text (see Longfellow [comm.
to verse 51]).  In it, Adam's non-canonical son Seth visits the gates
of the garden of Eden, now a wasteland, in search of some oil to ease
Adam's aching head.
Seth is not allowed to enter by the guardian angel, but does
see a very tall tree, denuded of its leaves.  The angel gives him a
branch from the tree (it is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil)
which he brings back to Adam, who has died before Seth returns to Limbo
with the branch.  Planted, it soon supplied the wood that would serve
for the crucifixion of Jesus.

	For a brief discussion of the 'Legend of the Wood of the Cross' as
being applicable to Dante's phrasing here see Edward Moore (^Studies in
Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968
(1903)]), pp. 219-20.  For these legends see Adolfo Mussafia ("Sulla
legenda del legno della Croce," ^Sitzungsberichte der
philosophisch-historischen Classe der kaiserlichen Akademie der
Wissenschaften~ [Vienna] 63 [1869], pp. 165-216).  It is remarkable
that the Gospel of Nicodemus has not made its way into other
commentaries to this tercet, since it has been a staple of commentators
since Torraca (comm. to. ^Inf~. IV.54) as a probable source for Dante's
sense of the harrowing of hell, witnessed by Virgil, as it is described
in ^Inferno~ IV.52-63.

	|52-60.~  The rays referred to are those of the sun when it moves from
Pisces into Aries, i.e., at the first buds of springtime, and before
the sun moves on and into Taurus.  Our natural season of blossoming is
compared, in this simile, to the miraculous and instantaneous flowering
of the tree that had so long been dead, the color of its blossoms
reminiscent of Christ's blood.

	|61-62.~  Dante leaves us with another of his little mysteries.  What
was the 'hymn' that he heard sung but could not understand, except to
know that it is not sung on earth?  Dante tells us as much and, as a
result, the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 61-66) reasons, we cannot identify it.
However, is there a hymn, known to be sung in Heaven, that we on earth
have never heard?

	The word ^inno~ (hymn) occurs six times in the poem in five passages
(^Inf~. VII.125; ^Purg~. VIII.17; XXV.127 & 129; here; ^Par~. XIV.123).
In the occurrences previous to this one the word has been used once
antiphrastically, to denigrate Plutus's unintelligible shout, and then,
in its next two appearances, to refer to the hymns 'Te lucis ante' and
'Summus Deus clementiae,' respectively.  In other words, until now
^inno~ has either been used antiphrastically and thus in a general
sense (i.e., 'an utterance not like a hymn') or with exactitude to
indicate a particular Christian hymn.  (For the final appearance of
^inno~ see the note to ^Par~. XIV.118-126.)  Are we supposed to be able
to identify this song?  There are, one must admit, times at which Dante
leaves melody a mystery; even twice in this very canto (the 'angelica
nota' [angelic song] of verse 33 and the 'pi@u dolce canzone' [song
more sweet] of verse 90, his references have successfully resisted
identification).  It would be unusual for Dante to have introduced a
riddle without offering us the grounds for solving it.  We are looking
for a song with two characteristics: it must be unknown on earth and it
almost certainly must be in celebration of Jesus's victory over death.
Is there such a song?  John of Serravalle (comm. to ^Par.~ XXXII.46-48) thought
so: the last book of the Bible speaks of a ^canticum novum~ (new song)
that is sung before the throne of God (Apoc. 14.3), a citation found,
surprisingly enough, only once again in the commentary tradition
(Steiner [comm. to vv. 61-63] and then possibly again, referred to
glancingly but not definitively by Trucchi [comm. to vv. 61-63]).
Robert Kaske ("Dante's ^Purgatorio~ XXXII and XXXIII: A Survey of
Christian History," ^University of Toronto Quarterly~ 43 [1974]), pp.
206-7, however, while unaware that he had at least two precursors, also
sees a reference here to the ^canticum novum~ of Revelation.  Kaske
cites Apocalypse 5:9, which is also apposite, if a similar passage (at
Apoc. 14:3) has a certain priority, as we shall see.  In Revelation 5
Christ comes as a slain lamb (Apoc. 5:6) to judge humankind, at which
the twenty-four elders and the four gospel beasts lower themselves
before the king (5:8) and sing a 'new song' (^canticum novum~): 'You
are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; ^for you
were slain and have redeemed us to God~....' (5:9, italics added).  The
related passage (Apoc. 14:3) deepens the resonances with ^Purgatorio~
XXXII: 'And they sang as it were a new song [^canticum novum~] before
the throne, and before the four beasts and the elders; ^and no man
could learn that song~ but the hundred and forty and four thousand, who
were redeemed from earth' (italics added).  It seems clear both what
the song was and why it is not sung on earth.  For the number of those
in the procession as 144, the number of the 144,000 of the Church
Triumphant, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.145-150.

	|63.~  Dante's mystic sleep closes his experience of the Church
Triumphant.  Once he awakens, it will have returned to Heaven (vv.
89-90).

	|64-69.~  Dante is willing to live dangerously.  What other medieval
poet, in a serious moment of a serious poem, would turn to Ovid and to
self-conscious literary humor in a moment like this?  Dante has already
(^Purg~. XXIX.94-96; and see the note to that tercet) referred to this
Ovidian material (^Metam~. I.568-723) in these cantos dedicated to the
recovery of Eden.  He compares himself to Argus of the hundred eyes
(Dante of the hundred cantos?), watching over Io at Juno's behest so
that Jove cannot get at his bovine girlfriend, set to drowsiness and
slumber (disastrously for him) by Mercury's tale of Syrinx and Pan.  At
what point does Argus fall asleep? just as Mercury's tale reports on
the musical sound that issues from the reeds that were Syrinx, who had
escaped Pan's lustful pursuit and vanished.  Music and a disappearance
are features of Dante's scene, as well.  The parallel scene is done
with witty aplomb but is dealt with by the commentators only as serious
business.  It is funny, as is Dante's aside to us that, if he could
portray the moment of falling asleep, he would do so.  His challenge to
us was taken up by Boccaccio in his ^Decameron~ (I.viii.14); with
Dante's passage apparently in his author's mind, Guglielmo Borsiere (a
denizen of hell in ^Inf~. XVI.70) describes a similar challenge when
asked what as yet unseen thing he would advise a wealthy boor to have
painted in his receiving room.  Guglielmo says that he wouldn't know
how to advise him, unless he were to choose 'a sneeze or something like
it.'

	|70-71.~  Dante's sleep and awakening in the garden is verbally
reminiscent of Ugolino's description of his awakening from his dreadful
dream (^Inf~. XXXIII.27), the phrase 'squarci@o il velame' (the
veil was rent) remembered in 'squarci@o il velo' (broke my veil of
sleep [these are the only two occurrences of that verb in the poem]).
It also reminds us that each of the three previous days on the mountain
have ended in sleep and dream.  On this fourth day, which will conclude
his experience of the earthly paradise at noon, instead he has this
mystic sleep ^after~ he has had a final visionary experience of the
griffin and his Church.

	|72.~  Rather than a reference to the 'Surgite, et nolite timere' of
Matthew 17:7, frequently cited in the commentaries (first by Jacopo
della Lana [comm. to vv. 73-84]), Mario Aversano ("Il canto XXXII del
^Purgatorio~," in ^La quinta rota: Studi sulla "Commedia"~ [Turin:
Tirrenia, 1988]), p. 168, prefers to believe that Matelda refers to
Paul's words (Ephesians 5:14), 'Surge qui dormis' (Rise, you who are
sleeping).  And see his remarks on Paul's overall importance for Dante,
pp. 185-88.  Nonetheless, the passage in Matthew seems still closer to
the context here, so much so that it is all but impossible not to see
it as controlling this scene: 'And Jesus came and touched them and
said, "Arise [^Surgite~] and be not afraid."  And when they had
lifted up their eyes they saw no man, save Jesus only.'  See the note
to ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.73-84.

	|73-84.~  In the scene of the transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew
17:1-8) the three apostles Peter, James, and John ascend a mountain
with Jesus, see him transformed in visage (it shines with light) and
raiment (his clothes become white), then see him in the company of
Moses and Elijah (who, representing the law and the prophets,
respectively, both promised his advent), and then hear the voice of God
from a cloud proclaim that Jesus is his Son, and finally find Moses and
Elijah vanished.  Just so, this simile insists, Dante thinks he finds
himself (in the role of an apostle) in the company of Matelda alone.
For a study of discussions of the Transfiguration by various fathers of
the Church, see Peter Chamberas ("The Transfiguration of Christ: A
Study in the Patristic Exegesis of Scripture," ^St. Vladimir's
Theological Quarterly~ 14 [1970], pp. 48-65).

	|78.~  Verse 78 also clearly refers to Christ's resurrections of
Jairus's daughter and of Lazarus (Luke 8:54 and John 11:43).

	|85.~  Dante's phrase, 'Where is Beatrice?' will be remembered when
she leaves him for the final time at ^Paradiso~ XXXI.64 and he asks St.
Bernard, 'Ov' @e ella?' (Where is she?), as Poletto (comm. to vv.
85-87) noted.

	|86-87.~  Beatrice's pose is one of humility, seated on the ground on
a root of the newly reflorescent tree.  Thus she who, rather than
Matelda, really corresponds to Christ in the biblical parallel is the
one who is 'transfigured,' 'changed in raiment,' as we shall see in a
moment.

	|88.~  Those who remain behind in the garden with Beatrice are her
'handmaids,' the seven virtues, and Matelda.  And of course there is
the chariot.  Dante and Statius are the spectators of the show that is
to follow.

	|89-90.~  We learn that the Church Triumphant has now returned
to the Empyrean, just as it will do after it descends for Dante's sake
a second time, in the sphere of the Fixed Stars (^Par~. XXIII.70-72).
(For the logistics of the arrival and departure of the participants
in this pageant, see the notes to ^Purg~. XXX.16-18 and XXXI.77-78.)
The Griffin's departure and return to the Empyrean foreshadow the
similar departure and return of Jesus described in ^Paradiso~ XXIII.86-87.

	|94.~  That Beatrice is described as seated 'on the bare ground'
associates her with humility in general and, perhaps more pointedly,
with St. Francis, who raised humility to an art form.  See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XI.135; and see the portrait of Francis in ^Paradiso~ XI.
For a recent review of the relations between Dante and the Spiritual
Franciscans see Nicol@o Mineo ("Gli spirituali francescani e
l'^Apocalisse~ di Dante," in ^Pour Dante: Dante et l'Apocalypse:
Lectures humanistes de Dante~, ed. Bruno Pinchard and Christian
Trottmann [Paris: Champion, 2001], pp. 77-98).

	|95.~  No longer the triumphant figure who came into the garden by
descending to her chariot, Beatrice is now here to witness its
devastation and, once, to protect that chariot; she is no longer in the
role of conqueror.

	|98-99.~  Since the nymphs are seven and since the 'candles' leading
the procession (last referred to at verse 18) are seven, and since
Benvenuto (comm. to vv.  97-99) lent the hypothesis his considerable
authority, some commentators have believed that those candles are the
lights held by the seven virtues.  Both because the seven candles seem
a part of the procession of the Church Triumphant and because they are
extremely large, this hypothesis has not convinced every reader.  On
the other hand, other suggestions are all minority opinions.  Francesco
da Buti (comm. to vv. 94-108) believed they represent the seven gifts
of the Holy Spirit, but many find his argument overly subtle and
unsupported by the text.  Torraca (comm. to vv. 97-99) suggested the
seven sacraments ordained by Christ.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.
97-99), uncomfortable with all earlier identifications, thought the
reference was to the lamps of the wise virgins in the parable (Matthew
25:1-13) of the ten wise and foolish virgins; but the wise ones only
number five.  Pertile (^La puttana e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei
Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), p.
198n., points (via Alain de Lille) to the 'seven lamps of fire burning
before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God' (Apoc. 4:5),
thus giving support to Francesco da Buti's view, which does seem the
most palatable.  For the biblical and post-biblical understanding of
the winds from north (Aquilo) and south (Auster) as being the most
destructive, see Pertile, pp. 197-202.

	|100-102.~  Beatrice's words are clear in their promise.  (Those who
believe that she is speaking not of Dante's next stay in the garden but
that left him on earth cannot rationalize the disjunction caused by the
fact that when Dante returns to earth he will be without Beatrice, who
speaks here only of being with him in Heaven.)  Most commentators now
also agree that Beatrice is not alluding to the few minutes he will now
be with her in the garden, but to the short stay he will have in his
second visit to the earthly paradise, after his death and ascent.  She
then looks past his first and upcoming visit to paradise in order to
fasten his attention on his final destination, when he, too, will be,
with her, a citizen of the City of God, the new Jerusalem in which
Christ is 'Roman.'  Denise Heilbronn ("Dante's Valley of the Princes,"
^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972], p. 57, n. 15), in another context, refers to
the Augustinian notion of the 'pilgrim city' that finds a place in
Dante's ^Epistola~ XI.11: 'pro tota civitate peregrinante in terris'
(for the entire human city in its earthly pilgrimage).  The 'city of
man' that is our militancy on earth is to become the heavenly Rome
presided over by Christ as emperor, at least it will be for all those
who will find themselves saved.

	|103-105.~  Beatrice's charge to Dante is reminiscent of God's to
John, author of the Revelation: 'What you see, write in a book, and
send it to the seven churches...' (Apoc. 1:11).

	|109-160.~  The second pageant in the garden of Eden is both
dramatically different from the first and exactly like it.  In the
first instance we were given a description of the Church Triumphant
(which exists as an ideal out of time and can only be gathered once
history is done) that comes in a temporal form, moving from Genesis to
the Apocalypse before Dante's eyes.  Now he sees real history, from
just after the founding of the Church until the present, unfolding as a
series of events performed in a sort of 'dumbshow' in a single place.
However, both pageants are presented as allegories, reflecting history,
to be sure, but experienced as though they were literally fictive
(e.g., the books of the Bible, the griffin, the depredations of the
Church), requiring the kind of critical procedure that we expect for
what Dante himself referred to (^Convivio~ II.i.4-5) as allegory as
practiced by the poets.
Most of the scenes in the ^Commedia~ are presented as 'historical' and
are best analyzed (or so it seems to many) with the methods of the
'allegory of the theologians'; for some others, however, that are presented
as fictive and thus call for the more usual allegorical procedures,
see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969]), pp. 239-54.
For a recent study of
the way in which the allegorizing tendencies of the early commentators
were continued in the Renaissance see Bruno Porcelli ("Beatrice nei
commenti danteschi del Landino e del Vellutello" [1994], in his ^Nuovi
studi su Dante e Boccaccio con analisi della "Nencia"~ [Pisa: Istituti
editoriali e poligrafici internazionali, 1997], pp. 57-78).

	The rest of the canto will present the history of the Church and of
the empire as these two entities make their related voyages through
history.
However, for a new interpretation of this entire scene, reversing many
long-held opinions about the valences of almost every element in this
difficult allegorical passage, see the final paragraph of the note to
^Paradiso~ XII.55.

	|109-117.~  The first tribulation of the new Church was to be
persecuted by the emperors of Rome, beginning with Nero (54-68) while
Peter was its first pope (and was crucified in the emperor's
persecution of Christians ca. A.D. 68), and extending to the reign of
Diocletian (284-305).

	While the eagle of Jove may signify variously, there is no doubt that
here and through the rest of the pageant of the persecution of the
Church Militant it represents the empire.

	|116.~  The phrase ^nave in fortuna~ (ship tossed in a tempest) will
find its way to the final world prophecy in the poem (^Par~. XXVII.145).

	|118-123.~  Beatrice, acting as the embodiment of the Church's spirit
(the chariot representing its physical being, as it were) is able to
defeat the forces of heresy, the traditional interpretation of the fox.
Portirelli (comm. to these verses) identified the fox with the 'vulpes
insidiosos' (insidious foxes) of the Song of Solomon (Cant. 2:15).  His
adjective, however, is not found in the biblical text, where the foxes
are only described as 'little,' and the phrase in fact comes from St.
Augustine, who identifies heresy and exactly such foxes in his
^Enarrationes in Ps. LXXX~, as was noted by Tommaseo (comm. to vv.
118-120).  The temporal progression of these scenes would indicate that
Dante is thinking of the early centuries of the Church's history, after
the first persecutions and before the Donation of Constantine (see the
note to ^Purg~. XXXII.124-129).

	|124-129.~  All commentators agree that this invasion of the chariot
by the eagle of empire represents the Donation of Constantine in the
first third of the fourth century (see note to ^Inf~. XIX.115-117).
The Church was meant to operate independently of the empire (this is
the essential theme of Dante's ^Monarchia~).  Here, by being given the
'feathers' that belong to empire alone, it is adulterated from its pure
form.  In this formulation Dante reverses his usual view, which
involves seeing the empire's rights and privileges as being curtailed
by the Church.  In a sense the point is even stronger expressed this
way: the Church is harmed by exercising its authority in the civil
realm.

	Since the gloss of the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 127-129), the voice from
heaven is generally taken to be that of St. Peter.  From the time of
the earliest commentators, however, there was an understanding that
Dante's voice from heaven was a sort of calque on the story that, on
the day of the Donation, a voice from heaven was heard calling out:
'Hodie diffusum est venenum in ecclesia Dei' (Today the church of God
is suffused by poison).

	|130-135.~  While there is some debate about the nature of this
particular calamity, most commentators believe it refers to the
'schism' in the Church brought about by Mohammed just after the middle
years of the seventh century (see the note to ^Inf~. XXVIII.22-31 for
Dante's understanding of the relation of Islam to Christianity).

	|136-141.~  In a sort of replay of the second calamity (the Donation
of Constantine) the chariot is once again covered in imperial feathers.
The standard interpretation of these verses is that they refer to the
grants of lands to the Church by two French kings, Pepin and
Charlemagne, in the second half of the eighth century.

	The 'plumage,' which the poet suggests was 'offered perhaps with kind
and innocent intent,' represents once again that which belonged to the
empire by God's intent, and legally, in Dante's view, could not be
surrendered to ecclesiastical authority, even though kings had chosen
to do so.  See ^Paradiso~ XX.55-57, where a similar expression is used
to indicate that Constantine had sinned grievously, if without meaning
to do so.

	|142-147.~  The language and the imagery are clearly indebted to the
Apocalypse (13:1) for the beast with seven heads and ten horns.
Exactly what this symbolic transformation of the Church signifies is
much discussed, with little resolution.  In general, all can agree, we
here see the corruption wrought by the clergy upon their own
institution.  In other words, in Dante's view, the Church had weathered
all attacks upon it from within and without until the time of
Charlemagne.  In the next five centuries she would do such harm to
herself as to make those earlier wounds mortal.  This period is marked
by corruption from the papacy down to the most modestly avaricious
friar; Christianity has no enemies as implacable as its own
ecclesiastical institutions or its own clergy.

	|148-160.~  Strictly speaking, this seventh and final calamity is a
vision, since the Church only moved to Avignon in 1309 after the
election to the papacy of Clement V in 1305.  We have now surveyed, in
52 verses, nearly thirteen centuries of the history of the Church.  For
the importance of Avignon to Dante, despite the fact that the city is
never mentioned by name in the poem, see Michelangelo Picone ("Avignone
come tema letterario: Dante e Petrarca," ^L'Alighieri~ 20 [2002],
pp. 5-22), pp. 5-14.

	The harlot and the giant, the whore of Babylon 'with whom the
kings of the earth have committed fornication' (Rev. 17:2) and Philip IV
of France, bring the terrible history to its conclusion.  The chariot no
longer has to do with Beatrice, replaced by this wanton spirit that gives
herself to all and any, and is now controlled by France.  Dante's reaction
to the 'Avignonian captivity' is proof, if any is needed, that he is not
the Protestant ^avant la lettre~ that some have tried to find in him.
Indeed, the last and only potentially (if fleeting) hopeful sign we
find in the gradually darkening anti-triumph of the Church Militant
is that the whore gazes on Dante, thus gaining for her a beating from
her gigantic paramour.	What does Dante represent now?	Is he the
embodiment of the truly faithful Christians who hope that their Church
will be cleansed? of the Italian faithful left back on this side of the
Alps? or is he Dante himself?  This penultimate detail of a difficult
and encompassing allegorical pageant has left many readers perplexed.
Its final one is clear in its pessimism.  The giant responds to his
lover's wayward glance by releasing the chariot from its binding to the
tree and dragging it deeper into the forest, which now looks less like
Eden than it resembles France.	Now see the revisionist and convincing
arguments of Filippo Bognini, "Gli occhi di Ooliba: Una proposta per
^Purg~. XXXII 148-60 e XXXIII 44-45," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 7
(2007): 73-103 (referred to in the note to ^Par~. XII.55): The whore is
Ezechiel's Jerusalem and thus Dante's Florence, while the giant reflects
Goliath as Robert of Anjou, the king of Naples and the Guelph leader in
Italy, prime enemy of Henry VII.
