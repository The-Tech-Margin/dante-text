The text in the DDP uses characters with diacritic markings. From time to time there is a need
to test parts of the DDP to make sure diacritics are being rendered correctly. To help with this,
you can add the following line of text temporarily to the desc.e file for the poem. (Doing it
here, as opposed to in some other text, is arbitrary.) I suggest adding it at the end of the PUBL
section of the file.

Diacritic test: a grave: @a, a aigu: $a, cedilla: $c, a umlaut: ,a, o circumflex: #o.
