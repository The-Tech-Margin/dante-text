In Dec. 2008 we discovered, through an email from a user, that the 
texts we had up as Purg. and Para. were the wrong texts. Here is the email:

Steve, Prof. Indizio, who contacted us was correct.  And now I can
see what happened. When Lexis sent us two versions of the Pietro di
Dante comm. I assumed, since I had asked for P2 & P3, that that is what
they sent.  Unfortunately, we got only what they had, P1 & P3.  And so
here is what we must do:  Take down ONLY the Purg. & Par. of P2, leaving
intact his Inf., and edit away, in the descrip., the Purg. & Par. stuff
(leaving the Inf., transcribed by Soc. Dant. Ital.).  I will hope that
one day we can have the rest of that text (if the SDI will prepare it
for us).  Sorry for the bother, which is entirely my fault and which
Massi was immediately helpful about, Bob

So we removed the Purg. and Para. and put back the original desc.e.
All the files related to the mistaken texts were moved to the directory
"Mistaken." Presumably they will never be used.   -stc
