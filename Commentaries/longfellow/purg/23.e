     "Under the shade of melancholy boughs
     Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time."

	|26.~  Erisichthon the Thessalian, who in derision cut
down an ancient oak in the sacred groves of Ceres.  He was
punished by perpetual hunger, till, other food failing him, at
last he gnawed his own flesh.  Ovid ^Met.~ VIII., Vernon's Tr.:
--

       "Straight he requires, impatient in demand,
     Provisions from the air, the seas, the land;
     But though the land, air, seas, provisions grant,
     Starves at full tables, and complains of want.
     What to a people might in dole be paid,
     Or victual cities for a long blockade,
     Could not one wolfish appetite assuage;
     For glutting nourishment increased its rage.
     As rivers poured from every distant shore
     The sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more;
     Or as the fire, which all materials burns,
     And wasted forests into ashes turns,
     Grows more voracious as the more it preys,
     Recruits dilate the flame, and spread the blaze:
     So impious Erisichton's hunger raves,
     Receives refreshments, and refreshments craves.
     Food raises a desire for food, and meat
     Is but a new provocative to eat.
     He grows more empty as the more supplied,
     And endless cramming but extends the void."

	|30.~  This tragic tale of the siege of Jerusalem by
Titus is thus told in Josephus, ^Jewish War~, Book VI. Ch. 3,
Whiston's Tr.: --

     "There was a certain woman that dwelt beyond Jordan; her
     name was Mary; her father was Eleazar, of the village
     Bethezub, which signifies the house of Hyssop.  She was
     eminent for her family and her wealth, and had fled away to
     Jerusalem with the rest of the multitude, and was with them
     besieged therein at this time.  The other effects of this
     woman had been already seized upon, such I mean as she had
     brought with her out of Perea, and removed to the city.
     What she had treasured up besides, as also what food she had
     contrived to save, had been also carried off by the
     rapacious guards, who came every day running into her house
     for that purpose.  This put the poor woman into a very great
     passion, and by the frequent reproaches and imprecations she
     cast at these rapacious villains, she had provoked them to
     anger against her; but none of them, either out of the
     indignation she had raised against herself, or out of
     commiseration of her case, would take away her life.  And if
     she found any food, she perceived her labors were for others
     and not for herself; and it was now become impossible for
     her any way to find any more food, while the famine pierced
     through her very bowels and marrow, when also her passion
     was fired to a degree beyond the famine itself.  Nor did she
     consult with anything but with her passion and the necessity
     she was in.  She then attempted a most unnatural thing, and,
     snatching up her son who was a child sucking at her breast,
     she said, "O thou miserable infant!  For whom shall I
     preserve thee in this war, this famine, and this sedition?
     As to the war with the Romans, if they preserve our lives,
     we must be slaves.  This famine also will destroy us, even
     before that slavery comes upon us.  Yet are these seditious
     rogues more terrible than both the other.  Come on, be thou
     my food, and be thou a fury to these seditious varlets, and
     a byword to the world; which is all that is now wanting to
     complete the calamities of the Jews.'  As soon as she had
     said this, she slew her son, and then roasted him, and ate
     the one half of him, and kept the other half by her
     concealed.  Upon this the seditious came in presently, and,
     smelling the horrid scent of this food, they threatened her
     that they would cut her throat immediately, if she did not
     show them what food she had gotten ready.  She replied, that
     she had saved a very fine portion of it for them; and withal
     uncovered what was left of her son.  Hereupon they were
     seized with a horror and amazement of mind, and stood
     astonished at the sight, when she said to them: `This is
     mine own son, and what hath been done was mine own doing.
     Come, eat of this food; for I have eaten of it myself.  Do
     not you pretend to be either more tender than a woman, or
     more compassionate than a mother.  But if you be so
     scrupulous, and do abominate this my sacrifice, as I have
     eaten the one half, let the rest be reserved for me also.'
     After which those men went out trembling, being never so
     much affrighted at anything as they were at this, and with
     some difficulty they left the rest of that meat to the
     mother.  Upon which the whole city was full of this horrid
     action immediately; and while everybody laid this miserable
     case before their own eyes, they trembled as if this unheard
     of action had been done by themselves. so those that were
     thus distressed by the famine were very desirous to die, and
     those already dead were esteemed happy, because they had not
     lived long enough either to hear or to see such miseries."

	         "And in this habit
       Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
       Their precious stones new lost."

	|32.~  In this fanciful recognition of the word ^omo~
(^homo~, man) in the human face, so written as to place the two
^o~'s between the outer strokes of the ^m~, the former represent
the eyes, and the latter the nose and cheekbones:

     {Illustration untranscribeable.}

	Brother Berthold, a Franciscan monk of Regensburg, in the
thirteenth century, makes the following allusion to it in one of
his sermons.  See Wakernagle, ^Deutsches Lesebuch~, I. 678.  The
monk carries out the resemblance into still further detail: --

     "Now behold, ye blessed children of God, the Almighty has
     created you soul and body.  And he has written it under your
     eyes and on your faces, that you are created in his
     likeness.  He has written it upon your very faces with
     ornamented letters.  With great dilligence are they
     embellished and ornamented.  This your learned men well
     understand, but the unlearned may not understand it.  The
     two eyes are two ^o~'s.  The ^h~ is properly no letter; it
     only helps the others; so that ^homo~ with an ^h~ means Man.
     Likewise the brows arched above, and the nose down between
     them are an ^m~, beautiful with three strokes.  So is the
     ear a ^d~, beautifully rounded and ornamented.  So are the
     nostrils beautifully formed like a Greek %varepsilon,
     beautifully rounded and ornamented.  So is the mouth an ^i~,
     beautifully adorned and ornamented.  Now behold, ye good
     Christian people, how skilfully he has adorned you with
     these six letters, to show that ye are his own, and that he
     has created you!  Now read me an ^o~ and an ^m~ and another
     ^o~ together; that spells ^homo.~ Then read me a ^d~ and an
     ^e~ and an ^i~ together; that spells ^dei. Homo dei~, man of
     God, man of God!"

	|48.~  Forese Donati, the brother-in-law and intimate
friend of Dante.  "This Forese," says Buti, "was a citizen of
Florence, and was brother of Messer Corso Donati, and was very
gluttonous; and therefore the author feigns that he found him
here, where the Gluttons are punished."

	Certain vituperative sonnets, addressed to Dante, have
been attributed to Forese.  If authentic, they prove that the
friendship between the two poets was not uninterrupted.  See
Rossetti, ^Early Italian Poets~, Appendix to Part II.

	|74.~  The same desire that sacrifice and atonement may
be complete.

that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"

postponed repentance till the last hour were forced to wait as
many years and days as they had lived impenitent on earth, unless
aided by the devout prayers of those on earth.  See Canto IV.

Forese.  Nothing is known of this good woman but the name, and
what Forese here says in her praise.

	|94.~  Covino, ^Descriz. Geograf. dell' Italia~, p.  52,
says: "In the district of Arborea, on the slopes of the
Gennargentu, the most vast and lofty mountain range of Sardinia,
spreads an alpine country which in Dante's time, being almost
barbarous, was called the ^Barbagia.~"

	|102.~  Sacchetti, the Italian novelist of the fourteenth
century, severly criticises the fashions of the Florentines, and
their sudden changes, which he says it would take a whole volume
of his stories to enumerate.  In Nov. 178, he speaks of their
wearing their dresses "far below their armpits," and then "up to
their ears"; and continues, in Napier's version, ^Flor. Hist.~,
II. 539: --

     "The young Florentine girls, who used to dress so modestly,
     have now changed the fashion of their hoods to resemble
     courtesans, and thus attired they move about laced up to the
     throat, with all sorts of animals hanging as ornaments about
     their necks.  Their sleeves, or rather their sack's, as they
     should be called, -- was there ever so useless and
     pernicious a fashion!  Can any of them reach a glass or take
     a morsel from the table without dirtying herself or the
     cloth by the things she knocks down?  And thus do the young
     men, and worse; and such sleeves are made even for sucking
     babes.  The women go about in hoods and cloaks; most of the
     young men without cloaks, in long, flowing hair, and if they
     throw off their breeches, which from their smallness may
     easily be done, all is off, for they literally stick their
     posteriors into a pair of socks and expend a yard of cloth
     on their wristbands, while more stuff is put into a glove
     than a cloak-hood.  However, I am comforted by one thing,
     and that is, that all now have begun to put their feet in
     chains, perhaps as a penance for the many vain things they
     are guilty of; for we are but a day in this world, and in
     that day the fashion is changed a thousand times: all seek
     liberty, yet all deprive themselves of it: God has made our
     feet free, and many with long pointed toes to their shoes
     can scarcely walk: he has supplied the legs with hinges, and
     many have so bound them up with close lacing that they can
     scarcely sit: the bust is tightly bandaged up; the arms
     trail their drapery along; the throat is rolled in a
     capuchin; the head so loaded and bound round with caps over
     the hair that it appears as though it were sawed off.  And
     thus I might go on forever discoursing of female
     absurdities, commencing with the immeasurable trains at
     their feet, and proceeding regularly upwards to the head,
     with which they may always be seen occupied in their
     chambers; some curling, some smoothing, and some whitening
     it, so that they often kill themselves with colds caught in
     these vain occupations."
