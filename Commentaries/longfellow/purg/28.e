	|1.~  The Terrestrial Paradise.  Compare Milton, ^Parad.
Lost~, IV. 214: --

	            "In this pleasant soil
     His Far more pleasant garden God ordained:
     Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
     All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
     And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
     High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit
     Of vegetable gold; and next to Life,
     Our death, the Tree of Knowledge, grew fast by,
     Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.
     Southward through Eden went a river large,
     Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill
     Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown
     That mountain as his garden mould, high raised
     Upon the rapid current, which through veins
     Of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
     Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill
     Watered the garden; thence united fell
     Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,
     Which from his darksome passage now appears;
     And now, divided into four main streams,
     Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm
     And country, whereof here needs no account;
     But rather to tell how, if art could tell,
     How from that sapphire found the crisped brooks,
     Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,
     With mazy error under pendent shades
     Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
     Flowers worthy of Paradise; which not nice art
     In beds and curious knots, but nature boon
     Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain;
     Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
     The open field, and where the unpierced shade
     Imbrowned the noontide bowers.  Thus was this place
     A happy rural seat of various view:
     Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm;
     Others, whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,
     Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,
     If true, here only, and of delicious taste.
     Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks
     Grazing the tender herb, were interposed;
     Or palmy hillock, or the flowery lap
     Of some irriguous valley spread her store;
     Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose.
     Another side, umbrageous grots and caves
     Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine
     Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps
     Luxuriant: meanwhile murmuring waters fall
     Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,
     That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
     Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams.
     The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,
     Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
     The trembling leaves; while universal Pan,
     Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,
     Led on the eternal spring."

	|2.~  Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 219: "As Homer gave
us an ideal landscape, which even a god might have been pleased
to behold, so Dante gives us, fortunately, an ideal landscape,
which is specially intended for the terrestrial paradise.  And it
will doubtless be with some surprise, after our reflections above
on the general tone of Dante's feelings, that we find ourselves
here first entering a ^forest~, and that even a ^thick~
forest.....

     "This forest, then, is very like that of Colonos in several
     respects, -- in its peace and sweetness, the number of
     birds; it differs from it only in letting a light breeze
     through it, being therefore somewhat thinner than the Greek
     wood; the tender lines which tell of the voices of the birds
     mingling with the wind, and of the leaves all turning one
     way before it, have been more or less copied by every poet
     since Dante's time.  They are, so far as I know, the
     sweetest passage of wood description which exists in
     literature."

	Homer's ideal ladscape, here referred to, in the
^Odyssey~ V., where he describes the visit of Mercury to the
Island of Calypso.  It is thus translated by Buckley: --

     "Immediately then he bound his beautiful sandals beneath his
     feet, ambrosial, golden; which carried him both over the
     moist wave, and over the boundless earth, with the breath of
     the wind.....Then he rushed over the wave like a bird, a
     sea-gull, which, hunting for fish in the terrible bays of
     the barren sea, dips frequently its wings in the brine; like
     unto this Mercury rode over many waves.  But when he came to
     the distant island, then, going from the blue sea, he went
     to the continent; until he came to the great cave in which
     the fair-haired Nymph dwelt; and he found her within.  A
     large fire was burning on the hearth, and at a distance the
     smell of well-cleft cedar, and of frankincense, that were
     burning, shed odor through the island: but she within was
     singing with a beautiful voice, and, going over the web,
     wove with a golden shuttle.  But a flourishing wood sprung
     up around her grot, alder and poplar, and sweet-smelling
     cypress.  There also birds with spreading wings slept, owls
     and hawks, and wide-tongued crows of the ocean, to which
     maritime employments are a care.  There a vine in its prime
     was spread about the hollow grot, and it flourished with
     clusters.  But four fountains flowed in succession with
     white water, turned near one another, each in different
     ways; but around there flourished soft meadows of violets
     and of parsley.  There indeed even an immortal coming would
     admire it when he beheld, and would be delighted in his
     mind; there the messenger, the slayer of Argus, standing,
     admired."

	And again, at the close of the same book, where Ulysses
reaches the shore at Phaeacia: --

     "Then he hastened to the wood; and found it near the water
     in a conspicuous place, and he came under two shrubs, which
     sprang from the same place; one of wild olive, the other of
     olive.  Neither the strength of the moistly blowing winds
     breathes through them, nor has the shining sun ever struck
     them with its beam, nor has the shower penetrated entirely
     through them: so thick were they grown entangled with one
     another; under which Ulysses came."

	The wood of Colonos is thus described in one of the
Choruses of the ^OEdipus Coloneus~ of Sophocles, Oxford Tr.,
Anon.: --

     "Thou hast come, O stranger, to the seats of this land,
     renowned for the steed; to seats the fairest on earth, the
     chalky Colonus; where the vocal nightingale, chief
     abounding, trills her plaintive note in the green vales,
     tenanting the dark-hued ivy and the leafy grove of the god,
     untrodden [by mortal foot], teeming with fruits, impervious
     to the sun, and unshaken by the winds of every storm; where
     Bacchus ever roams in revlry companioning his divine nurses.
     And ever day by day the narcissus, with its beauteous
     clusters, burst into bloom by heaven's dew, the ancient
     coronet of the mighty goddesses, and the saffron with golden
     ray; nor do the sleepless founts that feed the channels of
     Cephissus fail, but ever, each day, it rushes o'er the
     plains with its stainless wave, fertilizing the bosom of the
     earth; nor have the choirs of the Muses spurned his clime;
     nor Venus, too, of the golden rein.  And there is a tree,
     such as I hear not to have ever sprung in the land of Asia,
     nor in the mighty Doric island of Pelops, a tree unplanted
     by hand, of spontaneous growth, terror of the hostile spear,
     which flourishes chiefly in this region, the leaf of the
     azure olive that nourishes our young.  This shall neither
     any one in youth nor in old age, marking for destruction,
     and having laid it waste with his hand, set its divinity at
     naught; for the eye that never closes of Morian Jove regards
     it, and the blue-eyed Minerva."

	We have also Homer's description of the Garden of
Alcino,us, ^Odyssey~, VII., Buckley's Tr.: --

     "But without the hall there is a large garden, near the
     gates, of four acres; but around it a hedge was extended on
     both sides.  And there tall, flourishing trees grew, pears,
     and pomegranates, and apple-trees producing beautiful fruit,
     and sweet figs, and flourishing olives.  Of these the fruit
     never perishes, nor does it fail in winter or summer,
     lasting throughout the whole year; but the west wind ever
     blowing makes some bud forth, and ripens others.  Pear grows
     old after pear, apple after apple, grape also after grape,
     and fig after fig.  There a fruitful vineyard was planted:
     one part of this ground, exposed to the sun in a wide place,
     is dried by the sun; and some [grapes] they are gathering,
     and others they are treading, and further on are unripe
     grapes, having thrown off the flower, and others are
     slightly changing color.  And there are all kinds of beds
     laid out in order, to the furthest part of the ground,
     flourishing throughout the whole year: and in it are two
     fountains, one is spread through the whole garden, but the
     other on the other side goes under the threshold of the hall
     to the lofty house, from whence the citizens are wont to
     draw water."

	Dante's description of the Terrestrial Paradise will
hardly fail to recall that of Mount Acidale in Spencer's ^Faerie
Queene~ VI. x. 6: --

     "It was an Hill plaste in an open plaine,
     That round about was bordered with a wood
     Of matchlesse high, that seemed th'earth to disdaine;
     In which all trees of honour stately stood,
     And did all winter as in sommer bud,
     Spredding pavilions for the birds to bowre,
     Which in their lower braunches sung aloud;
     And in their tops the soring hauke did towre,
     Sitting like king of fowles in maiesty and powre.

     "And at the foote thereof a gentle flud
     His silver waves did softly tumble downe,
     Unmard with ragged mosse or filthy mud;
     Ne mote wylde beastes, ne mote the ruder clowne,
     Thereto approach; ne filth mote therein drowne:
     But Nymphes and Faeries by the bancks did sit
     In the woods shade which did the waters crowne,
     Keeping all noysome things away from it,
     And to the waters fall turning their accents fit.

     "And on the top thereof a spacious plaine
     Did spred itselfe, to serve to all delight,
     Either to daunce, when they to daunce would faine,
     Or else to course-about their bases light;
     Ne ought there wanted, which for pleasure might
     Desired be, or thence to banish bale:
     So pleasauntly the Hill with equall hight
     Did seeme to overlooke the lowly vale;
     Therefore it rightly cleeped was Mount Acidale."

XVI.

grows a spacious pine forest," says Covino, ^Descr. Geog.~, p.
39, "which stretches along the sea between Ravenna and Cervia."

	|40.~  This lady, who represents the Active life to
Dante's walking eyes, as Leah had done in his vision, and whom
Dante afterwards, Canto XXXIII. 119, calls Matilda, is generally
supposed by the commentators to be the celebrated Countess
Matilda, daughter of Boniface, Count of Tuscany, and wife of
Guelf, of the house of Suabia.  Of this marriage Villani, IV. 21,
gives a very strange account, which, if true, is a singular
picture of the times.  Napier, ^Flor. Hist.~, I. Ch. 4 and 6,
gives these glimpses of the Countess: --

     "This heroine died in 1115, after a reign of active exertion
     for herself and the Church against the Emperors, which
     generated the infant and as yet nameless factions of Guelf
     and Ghibelline.  Mathilda endured this contest with all the
     enthusiasm and constancy of a woman, combined with a manly
     courage that must ever render her name respectable, whether
     proceeding from the bigotry of the age, or to oppose
     imperial ambition in defence of her own defective title.
     According to the laws of that time, she could not as a
     female inherit her father's states, for even male heirs
     required a royal confirmation.  Matilda therefore, having no
     legal right, feard the Emperor and clung to the Popes, who
     already claimed, among other prerogatives, the supreme
     disposal of kingdoms.....

     "The Church had ever come forward as the friend of her
     house, and from childhood she had breathed an atmosphere of
     blind and devoted submission to its authority; even when
     only fifteen she had appeared in arms against its enemies,
     an made two successful expeditions to assist Pope Alexander
     the Second during her mother's lifetime.

     "No wonder, then, that in a superstitious age, when monarchs
     trembled at an angry voice from the Lateran, the habits of
     early youth should have mingled with every action of
     Matilda's life, and spread an agreeable ^mirage~ over the
     prospect of her eternal salvation: the power that tamed a
     Henry's pride, a Barbarossa's fierceness, and afterwards
     withstood the vast ability of a Frederic, might without
     shame have been reverenced by a girl whose feelings so
     harmonized with the sacred strains of ancient tradition and
     priestly dignity.  But from whatever motive, the result was
     a continual aggrandizement of ecclesiastics; in prosperity
     and adversity; during life and death; from the lowliest
     priest to the proudest pontiff.

     "The fearless assertion of her own independence by
     successful struggles with the Emperor was an example not
     overooked by the young Italian communities under Matilda's
     rule, who were already accused by imperial legitimacy of
     political innovation and visionary notions of
     government.....

     "Being then at a place called Monte Baroncione, and in her
     sixty-ninth year, this celebrated woman breathed her last,
     after a long and glorious reign of incessant activity,
     during which she displayed a wisdom, vigor, and
     determination of character rarely seen even in men.  She
     bequeathed to the Church all those patrimonial estates of
     which she had previously disposed by an act of gift to
     Gregory the Seventh, without, however, any immediate royal
     power over the cities and other possessions thus given, as
     her will expresses it, `for the good of her soul, and the
     souls of her parents.'

     "Whatever may now be thought of her chivalrous support, her
     bold defence, and her deep devotion to the Church, it was in
     perfect harmony with the spirit of that age, and has formed
     one of her chief merits with many even in the present.  Her
     unflinching adherence to the cause she had so
     conscientiously embraced was far more noble than the Emperor
     Henry's conduct.  Swinging between the extremes of
     unmeasured insolence and abject humiliation, he died a
     victim to Papal influence over superstitious minds; an
     influence which, amongst other debasing lessons, then taught
     the world that a breach of the most sacred ties and dearest
     affections of human nature was one means of gaining the
     approbation of a Being who it all truth and beneficience.

     "Matilda's object was to strengthen the chief spiritual
     against the chief temporal power, but reserving her own
     independence; a policy subsequently pursued, at least in
     spirit, by the Guelphic states of Italy.  She therefore
     protected subordinate members of the Church against feudal
     chieftains, and its head against the feudal Emperor.  True
     to her religious and warlike character, she died between the
     sword and the crucifix, and two of her last acts, even when
     the hand of death was already cold on her brow, were the
     chastisement of revolted Mantua, and the midnight
     celebration of Christ's nativity in the depth of a freezing
     and unusually inclement winter."

	|50.~  Ovid, ^Met.~ V., Maynwaring's Tr.: --

       "Here, while young Proserpine, among the maids,
     Diverts herself in these delicious shades;
     While like a child with busy speed and care
     She gathers lilies here, and violets there;
     While first to fill her little lap she strives,
     Hell's grizzly monarch at the shade arrives;
     Sees her thus sporting on the flowery green,
     And loves the blooming maid, as soon as seen.
     His urgent flame impatient of delay,
     Swift as his thought he seized the beauteous prey,
     And bore her in his sooty car away.
     The frighted goddess to her mother cries,
     But all in vain, for now far off she flies.
     Far she behind her leaves her virgin train;
     To them too cries, and cries to them in vain.
     And while with passion she repeats her call,
     The violets from her lap, and lilies fall:
     She misses them, poor heart! and makes new moan;
     Her lilies, ah! are lost, her violets gone."

	|65.~  Ovid, ^Met.~ X., Eusden's Tr.: --

       "For Cyther,ea's lips while Cupid prest,
     THe with a heedless arrow razed her breast.
     The goddess felt it, and, with fury stung,
     The wanton mischief from her bosom flung:
     Yet thought at first the danger slight, but found
     The dart too faithful, and too deep the wound.
     Fired with a mortal beauty, she disdains
     To haunt th' Idalian mount, or Phrygian plains.
     She seeks not Cnidos, nor her Paphian shrines,
     Nor Amathus, that teems with brazen mines:
     Even Heaven itself with all its sweets sought,
     Adonis far a sweeter Heaven is thought."

	|72.~  When Xerxes invaded Greece he crossed the
Hellespont on a bridge of boats with an army of five million.  So
say the historians.  On his return he crossed it in a fishing
boat almost alone, -- "a warning to all human arrogance."

	Leander naturally hated the Hellespont, having to swim it
so many times.  The last time, according to Thomas Hood, he met
with a sea nymph, who, enamored of his beauty, carried him to the
bottom of the sea.  See ^Hero and Leander~, stanza 45: --

     "His eyes are blinded with the sleety brine,
     His ears are deafened with the wildering noise;
     He asks the purpose of her fell design,
     But foamy waves choke up his struggling voice,
     Under the ponderous sea his body dips,
     And Hero's name dies bubbling on his lips.

     "Look how a man is lowered to his grave,
     A yearning hollow in the green earth's lap;
     So he is sunk into the yawning wave,
     The plunging sea fills up the watery gap;
     Anon he is all gone, and nothing seen,
     But likeness of green turf and hillocks green.

     "And where he swam, the constant sun lies sleeping,
     Over the verdant plain that makes his bed;
     And all the noisy waves go freshly leaping,
     Like gamesome boys over the churchyard dead;
     The light in vain keeps looking for his face,
     Now screaming sea-fowl settle in his place."

	|80. Psalm~ xcii. 4: "For thou, Lord, hast made me
glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands."

	|87.~  Canto XXI. 46: --

     "Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,
       Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls
       Than the short, little stairway of three steps."

	|94.~  Only six hours, according to Adam's own account in
^Par.~ XXI. 139: --

     "Upon the mount which highest o'er the wave
     Rises was I, with life or pure or sinful,
     From the first hour to that which is the second,
     As the sun changes quadrant to the sixth."

dreams of poets.
