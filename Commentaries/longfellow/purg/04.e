	|6.~  Plato's doctrine of three souls: the Vegetative in
the liver; the Sensitive in the heart; and the Intellectual in
the brain.  See ^Convito~, IV. 7.

	|15.~  See ^Convito~, II. 14, quoted ^Par.~ XIV. Note 86.

	|25.~  Sanleo, a fortress on a mountain in the duchy of
Urbino; Noli, a town in the Genoese territory, by the seaside;
Bismantova, a mountain in the duchy of Modena.

	|36.~  Like Christian going up the hill Difficulty in
Bunyan, ^Pilgrim's Progress~: "I looked then after Christian to
see him go up the hill, where I perceived he fell from running to
going, and from going to clambering upon his hands and knees,
because of the steepness of the place."

	|43.~  More than forty-five degrees.

	|61.~  If the sun were in Gemini, or if we were in the
month of May, you would see the sun still farther to the north.

	|64. Rubecchio~ is generally rendered red or ruddy.
But Jacopo dalla Lana says: "^Rubecchio~ in the Tuscan tongue
signifies an indented mill-wheel."  This interpretation certainly
renders the image more distinct.  The several signs of the Zodiac
are so many cogs in the great wheel; and the wheel is an image
which Dante more than once applies to the celestial bodies.

	|71.~  The Ecliptic.  See ^Inf.~ XVII., Note 107.

	|73.~  This, the Mountain of Purgatory; and that, Mount
Zion.

	|83.~  The Seven Stars of Ursa Major, and North Star.

	|109.~  Compare Thomson's description of the "pleasing
land of drowsy-head," in the ^Castle of Indolence~: --

     "And there a season atween June and May,
     Half prankt with spring, with summer half imbrowned,
     A listless climate made, where, sooth to say,
     No living wight could work, ne cared even for play."

	|123.~  `He loved also in life," says Arrivabene,
^Commento Storico~, 584, "a certain Belacqua, an excellent maker
of musical instruments."

	Benvenuto da Imola says of him:

     "He was a Florentine who made guitars and other musical
     instruments.  He carved and ornamented the necks and head of
     the guitars with great care, and sometimes also played.
     Hence Dante, who delighted in music, knew him intimately."
     This seems to be all that is known of Belacqua.

	|133. Measure for Measure~, II. 2: --

	          "True prayers
     That shall be up at heaven, and enter there
     Ere sunrise; prayers from preserved souls,
     From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
     To nothing temporal."
