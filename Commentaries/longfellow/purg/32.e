	|1.~  A mystical canto, in which is described the tree of
the forbidden fruit, and other wonderful and mysterious things.

	|2.~  Beatrice had been dead ten years.

	|10.~  Goethe, ^Hermann and Dorothea~, Cochrane's Tr., p.
103: --

     "Ev'n as the wanderer, who, ere the sun dips
	  his orb in the ocean,
     One last look still takes of the day-god, fast
	  disappearing;
     Then, amid rocks rude-piled, umbrageous
	  forests, and copsewoods,
     Sees his similitude float, wherever he fixes
	  his vision;
     Finding it glancing before him, and dancing
	  in magical colors."

	|35.~  A ^disfrenata saetta~, an uncurbed arrow, like
that which Pandarus shot at Menelaus, ^Iliad~, IV. 124: "The
sharp-pointed arrow sprang forth, eager to rush among the crowd."

	|38. Genesis ii.~ 16."Of every tree of the garden thou
mayest freely eat.  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt surely die."

	Some commentators suppose that Dante's mystic tree is not
only the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but also a symbol of
the Roman Empire.

	|41.~  Virgil, ^Georgics~, II. 123: "The groves which
India, nearer the ocean, the utmost skirts of the globe,
produces, where no arrows by their flight have been able to
surmount the airy summit of the tree; and yet that nation is not
slow at archery."

	|43.~  Christ's renunciation of temporal power.

	|51.~  The pole of the chariot, which was made of this
tree, he left bound to the tree.

	Buti says: "This chariot represents the Holy Church,
which is the congregation of the faithful, and the pole of this
chariot is the cross of Christ, which he bore upon his shoulders,
so that the author well represents him as dragging the pole with
his neck."  The statement that the cross was made of the tree of
knowledge, is founded on an old legend.  When Adam was dying, he
sent his son Seth to the Garden of Paradise to bring him some
drops of the oil of the mercy of God.  The angel at the gate
refused him entrance, but gave him a branch from the tree of
knowledge, and told him to plant it upon Adam's grave; and that,
when it should bear fruit, then should Adam receive the oil of
God's mercy.  The branch grew into a tree, but never bore fruit
till the passion of Christ; but "of a branch of this tree and of
other wood," says Buti, "the cross was made, and from that branch
was suspended such fruit as the body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and then Adam and other saints had the oil of mercy, inasmuch as
they were taken from Limbo and led by Christ into eternal life."

	|54.~  In the month of February, when the sun is in the
constellation of the Fishes.  Dante here gives it the title of
the Lasca, the Roach or Mullet.

	|58.~  The red and white of the apple-blossoms is
symbolical of the blood and water which flowed from the wound in
Christ's side.  At least so thinks Vellutelli.

	Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 226, says: "Some three
arrow-flights farther up into the wood we come to a tall tree,
which is at first barren, but, after some little time, visibly
opens into flowers, of a color `less than that of roses, but more
than that of violets.'  It certainly would not be possible, in
words, to come nearer to the ^definition~ of the exact hue which
Dante meant, -- that of the apple-blossom.  Had he employed any
simple color-phrase, as a `pale pink,' or `violet pink,' or any
other such combined expression, he still could not have
completely got at the delicacy of the hue; he might perhaps have
indicated its kind, but not its tenderness; but by taking the
rose-leaf as the type of the delicate red, and then enfeebling
this with the violet gray, he gets, as closely as language can
carry him, to the complete rendering of the vision, though it is
evidently felt by him to be in its perfect beauty ineffable; and
rightly so felt for of all lovely things which grace the
springtime in our fair temperate zone, I am not sure but this
blossoming of the apple-tree is the fairest."

	|65.~  The eyes of Argus, whom Mercury lulled asleep by
telling him the story of Syrinx, and then put to death.

	Ovid, ^Met.~, I., Dryden's Tr.: --

       "While Hermes piped, and sung, and told his tale,
     The keeper's winking eyes began to fail,
     And drowsy slumber on the lids to creep;
     Till all the watchman was at length asleep.
     Then soon the god his voice and song supprest,
     And with his powerful rod confirmed his rest;
     Without delay his crooked falchion drew,
     And at one fatal stroke the keeper slew."

	|73.~  The Transfiguration.  The passage in the ^Song of
Solomon~, ii. 3, "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood,
so is my beloved among the sons," is interpreted as referring to
Christ; and Dante here calls the Transfiguration the blossoming
of that tree.

	|77.~  Matthew xvii. 5."While he yet spake, behold, a
bright cloud overshadowed them: and, behold, a voice out of the
cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased; hear ye him.  And when the disciples heard it, they fell
on their face, and were sore afraid.  And Jesus came and touched
them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.  And when they had
lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only."

	|82.~  Matilda.

	|98.~  The seven Virtues holding the seven golden
candlesticks, or the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.

	|112.~  The descent of the eagle upon the tree is
interpreted by Buti as the persecution of the Christians by the
Emperors.  The rending of the bark of the tree is the "breaking
down of the constancy and fortitude of holy men"; the blossoms
are "virtuous examples or prayers," and the new leaves, "the
virtuous deeds that holy men had begun to do, and which were
interrupted by these persecutions."

	|115.~  Buti says: "This descent of the eagle upon the
chariot, and the smiting it, mean the persecution of the Holy
Church and of the Christians by the Emperors, as appears in the
chronicles down to the time of Constantine."

	|119.~  The fox is Heresy.

	|126.~  The gift of Constantine to the Church.  ^Inf.~
125: --

     "Ah, Constantine! of how much woe was mother,
       Not thy conversion, but that marriage-dower
       Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"

	|131.~  Mahomet. ^Revelation~ xii, 3: "And there appeared
another wonder in heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having
seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.  And
his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth."

	|144.~  These seven heads, say the ^Ottimo~ and others,
"denote the seven deadly sins."  But Biagioli, following Buti,
says: "There is no doubt that these heads and the horns represent
the same that we have said in Canto XIX. of the ^Inferno~;
namely, the ten horns, the Ten Commandments of God; and the seven
heads, the Seven Sacraments of the Church."  Never was there a
wider difference of interpretation.  The context certainly
favours the first.

	|150.~  Pope Boniface the Eighth.

	|152.~  Philip the Fourth of France For his character see
Canto XX. Note 43.

	|156.~  This alludes to the maltreatment of Boniface by
the troops of Philip at Alagna.  See Canto XX.  Note 87.

	|159.~  The removal of the Papal See from Rome to
Avignon.

	The principal points of the allegory of this canto may be
summed up as follows.  The triumphal chariot, the Church; the
seven Nymphs, the Virtues Cardinal and Evangelical; the seven
candlesticks, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit; the tree of
knowledge, Rome; the Eagle, the Imperial power; the Fox, heresy;
the Dragon, Mahomet; the shameless whore, Pope Boniface the
Eighth; and the giant, Philip the Fair of France.
