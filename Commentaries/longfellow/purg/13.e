	|1.~  The Second Circle, or Cornice, where is punished
the sin of Envy; of which St. Augustine says: "Envy is the hatred
of another's felicity; in respect of superiors, because they are
not equal to them; in respect of inferiors, lest they should be
equal to them; in respect of equals, because they are equal to
them.  Through envy proceeded the fall of the world, and the
death of Christ."

	|9.~  The livid color of Envy.

	|14.~  The military precision with which Virgil faces to
the right is Homeric.  Biagioli says that Dante expresses it
"after his own fashion, that is, entirely new and different from
mundane custom."

	|16.~  Boethius, ^Cons. Phil., V.  Met. 2: --

     "Him the Sun, then, rightly call, --
     God who sees and lightens all."

	|29.~  John ii. 3: "And when they wanted wine, the mother
of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."

	Examples are first given of the virtue opposite the vice
here punished.  These are but "airy tongues that syllable men's
names"; and it must not be supposed that the person alluded to
are actually passing in the air.

	|33.~  The name of Orestes is here shouted on account of
the proverbial friendship between him and Pylades.  When Orestes
was condemned to death, Pylads tried to take his place,
exclaiming, "I am Orestes."

	|36.~  Matthew v. 44: "But I say unto you, Love your
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute
you."

	|39.~  See Canto XIV. 147.

	|42.~  The next stairway leading from the seond to the
third circle.

	|51.~  The Litany of All Saints.

	|92.~  Latian for Italian.

	|109.~  A Sienese lady living in banishment at Colle,
where from a tower she witnessed the battle between her townsmen
and the Florentines.  "Sapia hated the Sienese," says Benvenuto,
"and placed herself at a window not far from the field of battle,
waiting the issue with anxiety, and desiring the rout and ruin of
her own people.  Her desires being verified by the entire
discomfiture of the Sienese, and the death of their captain."
(Provenzan Salvani, see Canto XI.  Note 121), "exultant and
almost beside herself, she lifted her bold face to heaven, and
cried, `Now, O God, do with me what thou wilt, do me all the harm
thou canst; now my prayers are answered, and I die content.'"

	|110.~  Gower, ^Confes. Amant.~, II.: --

     "Whan I have sense another blithe
     Of love and hadde a goodly chere,
     Ethna, which brenneth yere by yere,
     Was thanne nought so hote as I
     Of thilke sore which prively
     Mine hertes thought withinne brenneth."

	|114. Convito~, IV. 23: "Every effect, in so far as it
is effect, receiveth the likeness of its cause, as far as it can
retain it.  Therefore, inasmuch as our life, as has been said,
and likewise that of every living creature here below, is caused
by the heavens, and the heavens reveal themselves to all these
effects, not in complete circle, but in part thereof, so must its
movement needs be above; and as an arch retains all lives nearly,
(and, I say, retains those of men as well as of other creatures,)
ascending and curving, they must be in the similitude of an arch.
Returning then to our life, of which it is now question, I say
that it proceeds in the image of this arch, ascending and
descending."

	|122.~  The warm days near the end of January are still
called in Lombardy I ^giorni della merla~, the days of the
blackbird; from an old legend, that once in the sunny weather a
blackbird sang, "I fear thee no more, O Lord, for the winter is
over."

	|128.~  Peter Pettignano, or Pettinajo, was a holy
hermit, who saw visions and wrought miracles at Siena.  Forsyth,
^Italy~, 149, describing the festival of the Assumption in that
city in 1802, says: --

     "The Pope had reserved for this great festival the
     Beatification of Peter, a Sienese comb-maker, whom the
     Church had negleted to canonize till now.  Poor Peter was
     honored with all the solemnity of music, high-mass, an
     officiating cardinal, a florid panegyric, picture angels
     bearing his tools to heaven, and combing their own hair as
     they soared; but he received five hundred years ago a
     greater honor than all, a verse of praise from Dante."

	|138.~  Dante's besetting sin was not envy, but pride.

	|144.~  On the other side of the world.

	|151.~  The vanity of the Sienese is also spoken of
^Inf.~ XXIX. 123.

	|152.~  Talamone is a seaport in the Maremma, "many times
abandoned by its inhabitants," says the ^Ottimo~, "on account of
the malaria.  The town is utterly in ruins; but as the harbor is
deep, and would be of great utility if the place were inhabited,
the Sienese have spent much money in repairing it many times, and
bringing in inhabitants; it is of little use, for the malaria
prevents the increase of population."

	Talamone is the ancient Telamon, where Marius landed on
his return from Africa.

	|153.~  The Diana is a subterranean river, which the
Sienese were in search of for many years to supply the city with
water.  "They never have been able to find it," says the
^Ottimo~, "and yet they still hope."  In Dante's time it was
evidently looked upon as an idle dream.  To the credit of the
Sienese be it said, they perserved, and finally succeeded in
obtaining the water so patiently sought for.  The ^Pozzo Diana~,
or Diana's Well, is still to be seen at the Convent of the
Carmen.

	|154.~  The admirals who go to Talamone to superintend
the works will lose there more than their hope, namely, their
lives.
