	|1.~  Zara was a game of chance, played with three dice.

	|13.~  Messer Benincasa of Arezzo, who, while Vicario del
Podest@a, or Judge, in Siena, sentenced to death a brother and a
nephew of Ghino di Tacco for highway robbery.  He was afterwards
an Auditor of the Ruota in Rome, where, says Benvenuto, "one day
as he sat in the tribunal, in the midst of a thousand people,
Ghino di Tacco appeared like Scaevola, terrible and nothing
daunted; and having seized Benincasa, he plunged his dagger into
his heart, leaped from the balcony, and disappeared in the midst
of the crowd stupefied with terror."

	|14.~  This terrible Ghino di Tacco was a nobleman of
Asinalunga in the territory of Siena; one of those splendid
fellows, who, from some real or imaginary wrong done them, take
to the mountains and highways to avenge themselves on society.
He is the true type of the traditionary stage bandit, the
magnanimous melodramatic hero, who utters such noble sentiments
and commits such atrocious deeds.

	Benvenuto is evidently dazzled and fascinated by him, and
has to throw two Romans into the scale to do him justice.  His
account is as follows: --

     "Reader, I would have thee know that Ghino was not, as some
     write, so infamous as to be a great assassin and highway
     robber.  For this Ghino di Tacco was a wonderful man, tall,
     muscular, black-haired, and strong; as agile as Scaevola, as
     prudent and liberal as Papirius Cursor.  He was of the
     nobles of La Fratta, in the county of Siena; who, being
     forcibly banished by the Counts of Santafiore, held the
     noble castle of Radicofani against the Pope.  With his
     marauders he made many and great prizes, so that no one
     could go safely to Rome or elsewhere through those regions.
     Yet hardly any one fell into his hands, who did not go away
     contented, and love and praise him.....  If a merchant were
     taken prisoner, Ghino asked him kindly how much he was able
     to give him; and if he said five hundred pieces of gold, he
     kept three hundred for himself, and gave back two hundred,
     saying, `I wish you to go on with your business and to
     thrive.'  If it were a rich and fat priest, he kept his
     handsome mule, and gave him a wretched horse.  And if it
     were a poor scholar, going to study, he gave him some money,
     and exhorted him to good conduct and proficiency in
     learning."

	Boccaccio, ^Decameron~, X. 2, relates the following
adventure of Ghino di Tacco and the Abbot of Cligni.

     "Ghino di Tacco was a man famous for his bold and insolent
     robberies, who being banished from Siena, and at utter
     enmity with the Counts di Santa Fiore, caused the town of
     Radicofani to rebel against the Church, and lived there
     whilst his gang robbed all who passed that way.  Now when
     Boniface the Eighth was Pope, there came to court the Abbot
     of Cligni, reputed to be one of the richest prelates in the
     world, and having debauched his stomach with high living, he
     was advised by his physicians to go to the baths of Siena,
     as a certain cure.  And, having leave from the Pope, he set
     out with a goodly train of coaches, carriages, horses, and
     servants, paying no respect to the rumors concerning this
     robber.  Ghino was apprised of his coming, and took his
     measures accordingly; when, without the loss of a man, he
     enclosed the Abbot and his whole retinue in a narrow defile,
     where it was impossible for them to escape.  This being
     done, he sent one of his principal fellows to the Abbot with
     his service, requesting the favor of him to alight and visit
     him at his castle.  Upon which the Abbot replied, with a
     great deal of passion, that he had nothing to do with Ghino,
     but that his resolution was to go on, and he would see who
     dared to stop him.  `My Lord,' quoth the man, with a great
     deal of humility, `you are now in a place where all
     excommunications are kicked out of doors; then please to
     oblige my master in this thing; it will be your best way.'
     Whilst they were talking together, the place was surrounded
     with highwaymen, and the Abbot, seeing himself a prisoner,
     went with a great deal of ill will with the fellow to the
     castle, followed by his whole retinue, where he dismounted,
     and was lodged, by Ghino's appointment, in a poor, dark
     little room, whilst every other person was well accommodated
     according to his respective station, and the carriages and
     all the horses taken exact care of.  This being done, Ghino
     went to the Abbot, and said, `My Lord, Ghino, whose guest
     you are, requests the favor of you to let him know whither
     you are going, and upon what account?'  The Abbot was wise
     enough to lay all his haughtiness aside for the present, and
     satisfied him with regard to both.  Ghino went away at
     hearing this, and, resolving to cure him without a bath, he
     ordered a great fire to be kept constantly in his room,
     coming to him no more till next morning, when he brought him
     two slices of toasted bread, in a fine napkin, and a large
     glass of his own rich white wine, saying to him, `My lord,
     when Ghino was young, he studied physic, and he declares
     that the very best medicine for a pain in the stomach is
     what he has now provided for you, of which these things are
     to be the beginning.  Then take them, and have a good
     heart.'  The Abbot, whose hunger was much greater than was
     his will to joke, ate the bread, though with a great deal of
     indignation, and drank the glass of wine; after which he
     began to talk a little arrogantly, asking many questions,
     and demanding more particularly to see this Ghino.  But
     Ghino passed over part of what he said as vain, and the rest
     he answered very courteously, declaring that Ghino meant to
     make him a visit very soon, and then left him He saw him no
     more till next morning, when he brought him as much bread
     and wine as before, and in the same manner.  And thus he
     continued during many days, till he found the Abbot had
     eaten some dried beans, which he had left purposely in the
     chamber, when he inquired of him, as from Ghino, how he
     found his stomach?  The Abbot replied, `I should be well
     enough were I out of this man's clutches.  There is nothing
     I want now so much as to eat, for his medicines have had
     such an effect upon me, that I am fit to die with hunger."
     Ghino, then, having furnished a room with the Abbot's own
     goods, and provided an elegant entertainment, to which many
     people of the town were invited, as well as the Abbot's own
     domestics, went the next morning to him, and said, `My Lord,
     now you find yourself recovered, it is time for you to quit
     this infirmary.'  So he took him by the hand, and led him
     into the chamber, leaving him there with his own people; and
     as he went out to give orders about the feast, the Abbot was
     giving an account how he had led his life in that place,
     whilst they declared that they had been used by Ghino with
     all possible respect.  When the time came, they sat down and
     were nobly entertained, but still without Ghino's making
     himself known.  But after the Abbot had continued some days
     in that manner, Ghino had all the goods and furniture
     brought into a large room, and the horses were likewise led
     into the court-yard which was under it, when he inquired how
     his Lordship now found himself, or whether he was yet able
     to ride.  The Abbot made answer that he was strong enough,
     and his stomach perfectly well, and that he only wanted to
     quit this man.  Ghino then brought him into the room where
     all his goods were, showing him also to the window, that he
     might take a view of his horses, when he said, `My Lord, you
     must understand it was no evil disposition, but his being
     driven a poor exile from his own house, and persecuted with
     many enemies, that forced Ghino di Tacco, whom I am, to be a
     robber upon the highways, and an enemy to the court of Rome.
     You seem, however, to be a person of honor; as, therefore, I
     have cured you of your pain in your stomach, I do not mean
     to treat you as I would do another person that should fall
     into my hands that is, to take what I please, but I would
     have you consider my necessity, and then give me what you
     will yourself.  Here is all that belongs to you; the horses
     you may see out of the window: take either part or the
     whole, just as you are disposed, and go or stay, as is most
     agreeable to you."  The Abbot was surprised to hear a
     highwayman talk in so courteous a manner, which did not a
     little please him; so, turning all his former passion and
     resentment into kindness and goodwill, he ran with a heart
     full of friendship to embrace him: `I protest solemnly, that
     to procure the friendship of such an one as I take you to
     be, I would undergo more than what you have already made me
     suffer.  Cursed be that evil fortune which has thrown you
     into this way of life!"  So, taking only a few of his most
     necessary things, and also of his horses, and leaving all
     the rest, he came back to Rome.  The Pope had heard of the
     Abbot's being a prisoner, and though he was much concerned
     at it, yet, upon seeing him, he inquired what benefit he had
     received from the baths?  The Abbot replied, with a smile,
     `Holy Father, I found a physician much nearer, who has cured
     me excellently well'; and he told him the manner of it,
     which made the Pope laugh heartily, when, going on with his
     story, and moved with a truly generous spirit, he requested
     of his Holiness one favor.  The Pope, imagining he would ask
     something else, freely consented to grant it.  Then said the
     Abbot, `Holy Father, what I mean to require is, that you
     would bestow a free pardon on Ghino di Tacco, my doctor,
     because, of all people of worth that I ever met with, he
     certainly is most to be esteemed, and the damage he does is
     more the fault of fortune than himself.  Change but his
     condition, and give him something to live upon, according to
     his rank and station, and I dare say you will have the same
     opinion of him that I have.'  The Pope, being of a noble
     spirit, and a great encourager of merit, promised to do so,
     if he was such a person as he reported, and, in the mean
     time, gave letters of safe-conduct for his coming thither.
     Upon that assurance, Ghino came to court, when the Pope was
     soon convinced of his worth, and reconciled to him, giving
     him the priory of an hospital, and creating him a knight.
     And there he continued as a friend and loyal servant to the
     Holy Church, and to the Abbot of Cligni, as long as he
     lived."

the Ottimo, after the fight at Bibbiena, being pursued by the
enemy, endeavored to ford the Arno, and was drowned.  Others
interpret the line differently, making him the pursuing party.
But as he was an Aretine, and the Aretines were routed in this
battle, the other rendering is doubtless the true one.

	|17.~  Federigo Novello, son of Ser Guido Novello of
Casentino, slain by one of the Bostoli."A good youth," says
Benvenuto, "and therefore Dante makes mention of him."

	The Pisan who gave occasion to Marzucco to show his
fortitude was Marzucco's own son, Farinata degli Scoringiani.  He
was slain by Beccio da Caproni, or, as Benvenuto asserts,
declaring that Boccaccio told him so, by Count Ugolino.  His
father, Marzucco, who had become a Franciscan friar, showed no
resentment at the murder, but went with the other friars to his
son's funeral, and in humility kissed the hand of the murderer,
extorting from him the exclamation, "Thy patience overcomes my
obduracy."  This was an example of Christian forgiveness which
even that vindictive age applauded.

	|19.~  Count Orso was a son of Napoleone d'Acerbaja, and
was slain by his brother-in-law (or uncle) Alberto.

	|22.~  Pierre de la Brosse was the secretary of Philip de
Bel of France, and suffered at his hands a fate similar to that
which befell Pier della Vigna at the court of Frederick the
Second See Inf. XIII. Note 58.  Being accused by Marie de
Brabant, the wife of Philip, of having written love-letters to
her, he was condemned to death by the King in 1276.  Benvenuto
thinks that during his residence in Paris Dante learned the truth
of the innocence of Pierre de la Brosse.

	|74.~  This has generally been supposed to be Sordello
the Troubadour.  But is it he?  Is it Sordello the Troubadour, or
Sordello the Podest@a@ of Verona? or are they one and the same
person?  After much research, it is not easy to decide the
question, and to

	                "Single out
     Sordello, compassed murkily about
     With ravage of six long sad hundred years."

Yet as far as it is possible to learn it from various conflicting
authorities,

     Who will may hear Sordello's story told."

	Dante, in his treatise ^De Volgari Eloquio~, I. 15,
speaks of Sordello of Mantua as "a man so choice in his language,
that not only in his poems, but in whatever way he spoke, he
abandoned the dialect of his province."  But here there is no
question of the Proven$cal in which Sordello the Troubadour
wrote, but only of Italian dialects in comparison with the
universal and cultivated Italian, which Dante says "belongs to
all the Italian cities, and seems to belong exclusively to none."
In the same treatise, II.  13, he mentions a certain Grotto of
Mantua as the author of many good songs; and this Gotto is
supposed to be Sordello as Sordello was born at Go,ito in the
province of Mantua.  But would Dante in the same treatise allude
to the same person under different names?  Is not this rather the
Sordel de Goi, mentioned by Raynouard, ^Po$esies des Troub.~, V.
445?

	In the old Proven$cal manuscript quoted by Raynourard,
^Po$esies des Troub.~, V. 444, Sordello's biography is thus
given: --

     "Sordello was a Mantuan of Sirier, son of a poor knight,
     whose name was Sir El Cort.  And he delighted in learning
     songs and in making them, and rivalled the good men of the
     court as far as possible, and wrote love-songs and satires.
     And he came to the court of the Count of Saint Boniface, and
     the Count honored him greatly, and by way of pastime (a
     forma de solatz) he fell in love with the wife of the Count,
     and she with him.  And it happened that the Count quarrelled
     with her brothers, and became estranged from her.  And her
     brothers, Sir Icellis and Sir Albrics, persuaded Sir
     Sordello to run away with her; and he came to live with them
     in great content.  And afterwards he went into Provence, and
     received great honor from all good men, and from the Count
     and Countess, who gave him a good castle and a gentlewoman
     for his wife."

	Citing this passage, Millot, ^Hist. Litt. des Troub.~,
II. 80, goes on to say: --

     "This is all that our manuscripts tell us of Sordello.
     According to Agnelli and Platina, historians of Mantua, he
     was of the house of the Visconti of that city; valiant in
     deeds of arms, famous in jousts and tournaments, he won the
     love of Beatrice, daughter of Ezzelin da Romano, Lord of the
     Macra Trevigian, and married her; he governed Mantua as
     Podest@a and Captain General; and though son-in-law of the
     tyrant Ezzelin, he always opposed him, being a great lover
     of justice.

     "We find these facts cited by Crescimbeni, who says that
     Sordello was the lord of Go,ito; but as they are not
     applicable to our poet, we presume they refer to a warrior
     of the same name, and perhaps of a different family.

     "Among the pieces of Sordello, thirty-four in number, there
     are some fifteen songs of gallantry, though Nostrodamus says
     that all his pieces turn only upon philosophic subjects."

	Nostrodamus's account, as given by Crescimbeni, ^Volgar
Poesia~ II. 105, is as follows: --

     "Sordello was a Mantuan poet, who surpassed in Proven$cal
     song Calvo, Folchetto of Marseilles, Lanfranco Cicala,
     Percival Doria, and all the other Genoese and Tuscan poets,
     who took far greater delight in our Proven$cal tongue, on
     account of its sweetness, than in their own maternal
     language.  This poet was very studious, and exceeding eager
     to know all things, and as much as any one of his nation
     excellent in learning as well as in understanding and in
     prudence.  He wrote several beautiful songs, not indeed of
     love, for not one of that kind is found among his works, but
     on philosophic subjects.  Raymond Belinghieri, the last
     Count of Provence of that name, in the last days of his
     life, (the poet being then but fifteen years of age,) on
     account of the excellence of his poetry and the rare
     invention shown in his productions, took him into his
     service, as Pietro di Castelnuovo, himself a Proven$cal
     poet, informs us.  He also wrote various satires in the same
     language, and among others one in which he reproves all the
     Christian princes; and it is composed in the form of a
     funeral song on the death of Blancasso."

	In the ^Hist. Litt. de la France~, XIX. 452, Em$eric-
David, after discussing the subject at length, says: --

     "Who then is this Sordello, haughty and superb, like a lion
     in repose, this Sordello, who, in embracing Virgil, gives
     rise to this sudden explosion of the patriotic sentiments of
     Dante?  Is it a singer of love and gallantry?  Impossible.
     This Sordello is the old Podest@a of Mantua, as decided a
     Ghibelline as Dante himself; and Dante utters before him
     sentiments which he well knows the zealous Ghibelline will
     share.  And what still more confirms our judgment is, that
     Sordello embraces the knees of Virgil, exclaiming, `o glory
     of the Latians,' &c.  In this admiration, in this love of
     the Latin tongue, we still se the Podest@a, the writer of
     Latin; we do not see the Troubadour."

	Benvenuto calls Sordello a "noble and prudent knight,"
and "a man of singular virtue in the world, though of impenitent
life," and tells a story he has heard of him and Cunizza, but
does not vouch for it."Ezzelino," he says, "had a sister greatly
addicted to the pleasures of love, concerning whom much is said
in the ninth Canto of Paradiso.  She, being enamored of Sordello,
had cautiously contrived that he should visit her at night by a
back door near the kitchen of her palace at Verona.  And as there
was in the street a dirty slough in which the swine wallowed, and
puddles of filthy water, so that the place would seem in no way
suspicious, he caused himself to be carried by her servant to the
door where Cunizza stood ready to receive him.  Ezzelino having
heard of this, one evening, disguised as a servant, carried
Sordello, and brought him back.  Which done, he discovered
himself to Sordello, and said, `Enough; abstain in future from
doing so foul a deed in so foul a place.'  Sordello, terrified,
humbly besought pardon; promising never more to return to his
sister.  But the accursed Cunizza again enticed him into his
former error.  Wherefore, fearing Ezzelino, the most formidable
man of his time, he left the city.  But Ezzelino, as some say,
afterwards had him put to death."

	He says, moreover, that Dante places Sordello alone and
separate from the others, like Saladin in ^Inf.~ IV. 129, on
account of his superiority, or because he wrote a book entitled
"The Treasure of Treasures"; and that Sordello was a Mantuan of
the village of Go,ito, -- "beautiful of person, valiant of
spirit, gentle of manner."

	Finally, Quadrio, ^Storia d'ogni Poesia~, II. 130, easily
cuts the knot which no one can untie; but unfortunately he does
not give his authorities.  He writes: --

     "Sordello, native of Go,ito, (Sordel de Goi,) a village in
     the Mantuan territory, was born in 1184, and was the son of
     a poor knight named Elcort."  He then repeats the story of
     Count Saint Boniface, and of Sordello's reception by Count
     Raymond in Provence, and adds: "Having afterwards returned
     to Italy, he governed Mantua with the title of Regent and
     Captain-General; and was opposed to the tyrant Ezzelino,
     being a great lover of justice, as Agnelli writes.  Finally
     he died, very old and full of honor, about 1280.  He wrote
     not only in Proven$cal, but also in our own common Italian
     tongue; and he was one of those poets who avoided the
     dialect of his own province, and used the good, choice
     language, as Dante affirms in his book of ^Volgar
     Eloquenza.~"

	If the reader is not already sufficiently confused, he
can easily be come so by turning to Tiraboschi, ^Storia della
Lett. Ital.~, IV. 360, where he will find the matter thoroughly
discussed, in sixteen solid pages, by the patient librarian of
Modena, who finally gives up in despair and calls on the Royal
Academy for help;

	            "But that were overbold; --
     Who would has heard Sordello's story told."

	|76.~  Before Dante's time Fra Guittone had said, in his
famous ^Letter to the Florentines~: "O queen of cities, court of
justice, school of wisdom, mirror of life, and mould of manners,
whose sons were kings, reigning in every land, or were above all
others, who art no longer queen but servant, oppressed and
subject to tribute! no longer court of justice, but cave of
robbers, and school of all folly and madness, mirror of death and
mould of felony, whose great strength is stripped and broken,
whose beautiful face is covered with foulness and shame; whose
sons are no longer kings but vile and wretched servants, held,
wherever they go, in opprobrium and derision by others."

	See also Petrarca, ^Canzone~ XVI., Lady Dacre's Tr.,
beginning: --

     O my own Italy! though words are vain
     The mortal wounds to close,
     Unnumbered, that thy beauteous bosom stain,
     Yet may it soothe my pain
     To sigh for the Tiber's woes,
     And Arno's wrongs, as on Po's saddened shore
     Sorrowing I wander and my numbers pour."

And Filicaja's sonnet: --

     "Italy! Italy! thou who'rt doomed to wear
       The fatal gift of beauty, and possess
       The dower funest of infinite wretchedness,
     Written upon thy forehead by despair;
       Ah! would that thou wert stronger, or less fair,
       That they might fear thee more, or love thee less,
       Who in the splendor of thy loveliness
       Seem wasting, yet to mortal combat dare!
     Then from the Alps I should not see descending
       Such torrents of armed men, nor Gallic horde
       Drinking the wave of Po, distained with gore,
     Nor should I see thee girded with a sword
       Not thine, and with the stranger's arm contending,
       Victor or vanquished, slave forevermore."

	|89.~  Gibbon, ^Decline and Fall~, ch. XLIV., says: --

     "The vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled
     into dust; but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a
     fair and everlasting monument.  Under his reign, and by his
     care, the civil jurisprudence was digested in the immortal
     works of the Code, the PANDECTS, and the INSTITUTES; the
     public reason of the Romans has been silently or studiously
     transfused into the domestic institutions of Europe, and the
     laws of Justinian still command the respect or obedience of
     independent nations.  Wise or fortunate is the prince who
     connects his own reputation with the honor and interest of a
     perpetual order of men."

	|92.~  Luke xii. 17: "Render to Caesar the things that
are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."

     Or ellis ye don ille."

	|97.~  Albert, son of the Emperor Rudolph, was the second
of the house of Hapsburg who bore the title of King of the
Romans.  He was elected in 1298, but never went to Italy to be
crowned.  He came to an untimely and violent death, by the hand
of his nephew John, in 1308.  This is the judgment of Heaven to
which Dante alludes.

	His successor was Henry of Luxembourg, Dante's "divine
and triumphant Henry," who, in 1311, was crowned at Milan with
the Iron Crown of Lombardy ^il Sacro Chiodo~ as it is sometimes
called, from the plate of iron with which the crown is lined,
being, according to tradition, made from a nail of the Cross.  In
1312, he was again crowned with the Golden Crown at Rome, and
died in the following year.  "But the end of his career drew on,"
says Milman, ^Latin Christ.~, VI. 520.  "He had now advanced, at
the head of an army which his enemies dared not meet in the
field, towards Siena.  He rode still, seemingly in full vigor and
activity.  But the fatal air of Rome had smitten his strength.  A
carbuncle had formed under his knee; injudicious remedies
inflamed his vitiated blood.  He died at Buonconvento, in the
midst of his awe-struck army, on the festival of St. Bartholomew.
Rumors of foul practice, of course, spread abroad; a Dominican
monk was said to have administered poison in the Sacrament, which
he received with profound devotion.  His body was carried in sad
state, and splendidly interred at Pisa.

     "So closed that empire, in which, if the more factious and
     vulgar Ghibellines beheld their restoration to their native
     city, their triumph, their revenge, their sole
     administration of public affairs, the nobler Ghibellinism of
     Dante foresaw the establishment of a great universal
     monarchy necessary to the peace and civilization of mankind.

     was Henry of Luxembourg.  Neither Dante nor his time can be
     understood but through this treatise.  The attempt of the
     Pope to raise himself to a great pontifical monarchy had
     manifestly ignominiously failed: the Ghibelline is neither
     amazed nor distressed at this event.  It is now the turn of
     the Imperialist to unfold his noble vision. `An universal
     monarchy is absolutely necessary for the welfare of the
     world'; and this is part of his singular reasoning: `Peace,'
     (says the weary exile, the man worn out in cruel strife, the
     wanderer from city to city, each of those cities more
     fiercely torn by faction than the last,) `universal Peace is
     the first blessing of mankind.  The angels sang, not riches
     or pleasures, but peace on earth: peace the Lord bequeathed
     to his disciples.  For peace One must rule.  Mankind is most
     like God when at unity, for God is One; therefore under a
     monarchy.  Where there is parity there must be strife; where
     strife, judgment; the judge must be a third party
     intervening with supreme authority.' Without monarchy can be
     no justice, nor even liberty; for Dante's monarch is no
     arbitrary despot, but a constitutional sovereign; he is the
     Roman law impersonated in the Emperor; a monarch who should
     leave all the nations, all the free Italian cities, in
     possession of their rights and old municipal institutions."

     "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
     By thee, old Capulet and Montague,
     Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,
     And made Verona's ancient citizens
     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
     Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate."

	|112.~  The state of Rome in Dante's time is thus
described by Mr Norton, ^Travel and Study~, pp. 246-248: --

     "On the slope of the Quirinal Hill, in the quiet enclosure
     of the convent of St. Catherine of Siena, stands a square,
     brick tower, seven stories high.  It is a conspicuous object
     in any general view of Rome; for there are few other towers
     so tall, and there is not a single spire or steeple in the
     city.  It is the Torre delle Milizie.  It was begun by Pope
     Gregory the Ninth, and finished near the end of the
     thirteenth century by his vigorous and warlike successor,
     Boniface the Eighth.  Many such towers were built for the
     purposes of private warfare, in those times when the streets
     of Rome were the fighting places of its noble families; but
     this is, perhaps, the only one that now remains undiminished
     in height and unaltered in appearance.  It was a new
     building when Dante visited Rome; and it is one of the very
     few edifices that still preserve the aspect they then
     presented.  The older ruins have been greatly changed in
     appearance, and most of the structures of the Middle Ages
     have disappeared, in the vicissitudes of the last few
     centuries.  The Forum was then filled with a confused mass
     of ruins and miserable dwellings, with no street running
     through their intricacies.  The Capitol was surrounded with
     uneven battlemented walls, and bore the character and look
     of an irregular citadel.  St. Peter's was a low basilica;
     the Colosseum had suffered little from the attacks of Popes
     or princes, neither the Venetian nor the Farnese palace
     having as yet been built with stones from its walls; and
     centuries were still to pass before Michael Angelo, Bernini,
     and Borromini were to stamp its present character upon the
     face of the modern city.  The siege and burning of Rome by
     Robert Guiscard, in 1084, may be taken as the dividing-line
     between the city of the Emperors and the city of the Popes,
     between ancient and modern Rome.  ....Rome was in a state of
     too deep depression, its people were too turbulent and
     unsettled, to have either the spirit or the opportunity for
     great works.  There was no established and recognized
     authority, no regular course of justice.  There was not even
     any strong force, rarely any overwhelming violence, which
     for a time at least could subdue opposition, and organize a
     steady, and consequently a beneficent tyranny.  The city was
     continually distracted by petty personal quarrels, and by
     bitter family feuds.  Its obscure annals are full of bloody
     civil victories and defeats, -- victories which brought no
     gain to those who won them, defeats which taught no lesson
     to those who lost them.  The breath of liberty never
     inspired with life the dead clay of Rome; and though for a
     time it might seem to kindle some vital heat, the glow soon
     grew cold, and speedily disappeared.  The records of
     Florence, Siena, Bologna, and Perugia are as full of
     fighting and bloodshed as those of Rome; but their fights
     were not mere brawls, nor were their triumphs always barren.
     Even the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which were like
     the coming of the spring after a long winter making the
     earth to blossom, and gladdening the hearts of men, -- the
     centuries which elsewhere in Italy, and over the rest of
     Europe, gave birth to the noblest mediaevel Art, when every
     great city was adorning itself with the beautiful works of
     the new architecture, sculpture, and painting, -- even these
     centuries left scarcely any token of their passage over
     Rome.  The sun, breaking through the clouds that had long
     hidden it, shone everywhere but here.  While Florence was
     building her Cathedral and her Campanile, and Orvieto her
     matchless Duomo -- while Pisa was showing her piety and her
     wealth in her Cathedral, her Camposanto, her Baptistery, and
     her Tower, -- while Siena was beginning a church greater and
     more magnificent in design than her shifting fortune would
     permit her to complete, -- Rome was building neither
     cathedral nor campanile, but was selling the marbles of her
     ancient temples and tombs to the builders of other cities,
     or quarrying them for her own mean uses."

	|118.~  This recalls Pope's ^Universal Prayer~, --

     "Father of all! in every age,
     In every clime, adored,
     By saint, by savage, and by sage,
     Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!"

after Archimedes had defended it so long with his engines and
burning-glasses, but a descendant of his, who in the civil wars
took part with Pompey and was banished by Caesar.  Pope's ^Essay

     "And more true joy Marcellus exiled feels,
     Than C@ae@sar with a senate at his heels."

	|127.~  Of the state of Florence, Napier writes, ^Flor.
Hist.~, I. 122: --

     "It was not the simple movement of one great body against
     another; not the force of a government in opposition to the
     people; not the struggle of privilege and democracy, of
     poverty and riches, or starvation and repletion; but one
     universal burst of unmitigated anarchy.  In the streets,
     lanes, and squares, in the courts of palaces and humbler
     dwellings, were heard the clang of arms, the screams of
     victims, and the gush of blood: the bow of the bridegroom
     launched its arrows into the very chambers of his young
     bride's parents and relations, and the bleeding son, the
     murdered brother, or the dying husband were the evening
     visitors of Florentine maids and matrons, and aged citizens.
     Every art was practised to seduce and deceive, and none felt
     secure even of their nearest and dearest relatives.  In the
     morning a son left his paternal roof with undiminished love,
     and returned at evening a corpse, or the most bitter enemy!
     Terror and death were triumphant; there was no relaxation,
     no peace by day or night: the crash of the stone, the twang
     of the bow, the whizzing shaft, the jar of the trembling
     mangonel from tower and turret, were the dismal music of
     Florence, not only for hours and days, but months and years.
     Doors, windows, the jutting galleries and roofs, were all
     defended, and yet all unsafe: no spot was sacred, no
     tenement secure: in the dead of night, the most secret
     chambers, the very hangings, even the nuptial bed itself,
     were often known to conceal an enemy.

     "Florence in those days was studded with lofty towers; most
     of the noble families possessed one or more, at least two
     hundred feet in height, and many of them far above that
     altitude.  These were their pride, their family citadels;
     and jealously guarded; glittering with arms and men, and
     instruments of war.  Every connecting balcony was alive with
     soldiers; the battle raged above and below, within and
     without; stones rained in showers, arrows flew thick and
     fast on every side; the ^seraglj~, or barricades, were
     attacked and defended by chosen bands armed with lances and
     boar-spears; foes were in ambush at every corner, watching
     the bold or heedless enemy; confusion was everywhere
     triumphant, a demon seemed to possess the community, and
     public mind, reeling with hatred, was steady only in the
     pursuit of blood.  Yet so accustomed did they at last become
     to this fiendish life, that one day they fought, the next
     caroused together in drunken gambols, foe with foe, boasting
     of their mutual prowess; nor was it until after nearly five
     years of reciprocal destruction, that, from mere lassitude,
     they finally ceased thus to mangle each other, and, as it
     were for relaxation, turned their fury on the neighboring
     states."

	|147.~  Upon this subject Napier, ^Flor. Hist.~, II. 626,
remarks: --

     "A characteristic, and, if discreetly handled, a wise
     regulation of the Florentines, notwithstanding Dante's
     sarcasms, was the periodical revision of their statutes and
     ordinances, a weeding out, as it were, of the obsolete and
     contradictory, and a substitution of those which were better
     adapted to existing circumstances and the forward movement
     of man. There are certain fundamental laws necessarily
     permanent and admitted by all communities, as there are
     certain moral and theological truths acknowledged by all
     religions; but these broad frames or outlines are commonly
     filled up with a thick network of subordinate regulations,
     that cover them like cobwebs, and often impede the march of
     improvement.  The Florentines were early aware of this, and
     therefore revised their laws and institutions more or less
     frequently and sometimes factiously, according to the
     turbulent or tranquil condition of the times; but in 1394,
     after forty years' omission, an officer was nominated for
     that purpose, but whether permanently or not is doubtful."
