	|1.~  In this canto Dante, having made confession of his
sins, is drawn by Matilda through the river Lethe.

	|2.~  Hitherto Beatrice has directed her discourse to her
attendant handmaidens around the chariot.  Now she speaks
directly to Dante.

	|25.~  As in a castle or fortress.

	|30.~  As one fascinated and enamored with them.

	|42.~  The sword of justice is dulled by the wheel being
turned against its edge.  This is the usual interpretation; but a
friend suggests that the allusion may be to the wheel of St.
Catherine, which is studded with sword-blades.

	|46.~  The grief which is the cause of your weeping.

	|59.~  There is a good deal of gossiping among the
commentators about this little girl or ^Pargoletta.~  Some
suppose it to be the same as the Gentucca of Canto XXIV. 37, and
the Pargoletta of one of the poems in the ^Canzoniere~, which in
Mr. Lyell's translation runs as follows:--

     "Ladies, behold a maiden fair, and young;
       To you I come heaven's beauty to display,
       And manifest the place from whence I am.
     In heaven I dwelt, and thither shall return,
       Joy to impart to angels with my light.
       He who shall me behold nor be enamored,
       Of Love shall never comprehend the charm;
       For every pleasing gift was freely given,
       When Nature sought the grant of me from him.
       Who willed that your companion I should be.
     Each star upon my eyes its influence sheds,
       And with its light and virtue I am blest:
       Beauties are mine the world hath never seen,
       For I obtained them in the realms above;
       And ever must their essence rest unknown,
       Unless through consciousness of him in whom
       Love shall abide through pleasure of another.
     These words a youthful angel bore inscribed
       Upon her brow, whose vision we beheld;
       And I, who to find safety gazed on her,
       A risk incur that it may cost my life;
       For I received a wound so deep and wide
       From one I saw entrenched within her eyes,
       That still I weep, nor peace I since have known."

	Others think the allusion is general.  The ^Ottimo~ says:
"Neither that young woman, whom in his ^Rime~ he called
Pargoletta, nor that Lisetta, nor that other mountain maiden, nor
this one, nor that other."  He might have added the lady of
Bologna, of whom Dante sings in one of his sonnets:--

	                "And I may say
     That in an evil hour I saw Bologna,
     And that fair lady whom I looked upon."

	Buti gives a different interpretation of the word
^pargoletta~, making it the same as ^pargult@a~ or ^pargolezza~,
"childishness or indiscretion of youth."

	In all this unnecessary confusion one thing is quite
evident.  As Beatrice is speaking of the past, she could not
possibly allude to Gentucca, who is spoken of as one who would
make Lucca pleasant to Dante at some future time:--

     "`A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,'
     Began he, `who to thee shall pleasant make
     My city, howsoever men may blame it.'"

	Upon the whole, the interpretation of the ^Ottimo~ is the
most satisfactory, or at all events the least open to objection.

	|63. Proverbs~ i. 17: "Surely in vain the net is
spread in the sight of any bird."

	|72.~  Iarbas, king of Gaetulia, from whom Dido bought
the land for building Carthage.

	|77.~  The angels described in Canto XXX. 20, as

     "Scattering flowers above and round about."

	|92.~  Matilda, described in Canto XXVIII. 40: --

     "A lady alone, who went along
       Singing and culling floweret after floweret,
       With which her pathway was all painted over."

	|95.~  Bunyan, ^Pilgrim's Progress~, the river without a
bridge: --

     "Now I further saw that betwixt them and the gate was a
     river; but there was no bridge to go over: the river was
     very deep.  At the sight therefore of this river, the
     pilgrims were much stunned; but the men that went with them
     said, `You must go through, or you cannot come at the
     gate.'....

     "They then addressed themselves to the water, and, entering,
     Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend
     Hopeful, he said, `I sink in deep waters; the billows go
     over my head, all his waves go over me.  Selah..'...

     "Now upon the bank of the river, on the other side, they saw
     the two shining men again, who there waited for them.
     Wherefore being come out of the river, they saluted them,
     saying, `We are administering spirits, sent forth to
     minister for those that shall be heirs of salvation.'"

	|98. Psalms~ li. 7: "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall
be clean: wash me and I shall be whiter than snow."

	|104.~  The four attendant Nymphs on the left of the
triumphal chariot.  See Canto XXIX. 130: --

     "Upon the left hand four made holiday
     Vested in purple."

	|106.~  See Canto I.  Note 23.

	|111.~  These four Cardinal Virtues lead to Divine
Wisdom, but the three Evangelical Virtues quicken the sight to
penetrate more deeply into it.

	|114.~  Standing upon the chariot still; she does not
alight till line 36 of the next canto.

	|116.~  The color of Beatrice's eyes has not been passed
over in silence by the commentators.  Lani, in his ^Annotazioni~,
says: "They were of a greenish blue, like the color of the sea."
Mechior Messirini, who thought he had discovered a portrait of
Beatrice as old as the fourteenth century, affirms that she had
"splendid brown eyes."  Dante here calls them emeralds; upon
which the ^Ottimo~ comments thus: "Dante very happily introduces
this precious stone, considering its properties, and considering
that griffins watch over emeralds.  The emerald is the prince of
all green stones; no gem nor herb has greater greenness; it
reflects an image like a mirror; increases wealth; is useful in
litigation and to orators; is good for convulsions and epilepsy;
preserves and strengthens the sight; restrains lust; restores
memory; is powerful against phantoms and demons; calms tempests;
stanches blood, and is useful to soothsayers."

	The beauty of green eyes, ^ojuelos verdes~, is extolled
by Spanish poets; and is not left unsung by poets of other
countries.  Lycophron in his "tenebrous poem" of ^Cassandra~,
says of Achilles: --

     "Lo! the warlike eagle come,
     Green of eye, and black of plume."

	And in one of the old French Mysteries, ^Hist. Th$eat.
Fran.~, I. 176, Joseph describes the child Jesus as having

     "Les yeulx vers, la chair blanche et tendre
     Les cheveulx blonds."

	|122.~  Monster is here used in the sense of marvel or
prodigy.

	|123.~  Now as an eagle, now as a lion.  The two natures,
divine and human, of Christ are reflected in Theology, or Divine
Wisdom.  Didron, who thinks the Griffin a symbol of the Pope,
applies this to his spiritual and temporal power: "As priest he
is the eagle floating in the air; as king he is lion walking on
the earth."

	|132.~  The Italian ^Caribo~, like the English Carol or
Roundelay, is both song and dance.  Some editions read in this
line "singing," instead of "dancing."
