	|1.~  The trance and vision of Dante, and the ascent to
the Fourth Circle, where the sin of Sloth is punished.

	|2. Iliad~, III. 10: "As the south wind spreads a mist
upon the brow of a mountain, by no means agreeable to the
shepherd, but to the robber better than night, in which a man
sees only as far as he can cast a stone."

	|19.~  In this vision are represented some of the direful
effects of anger, beginning with the murder of Itys by his
mother, Procne, and her sister, Philomela.  Ovid, VI.: --

     "Now, at her lap arrived, the flattering boy
     Salutes his parent with a smiling joy;
     About her neck his little arms are thrown,
     And he accosts her in a prattling tone.
     .....
     When Procne, on revengeful mischief bent,
     Home to his heart a piercing poniard sent.
     Itys, with rueful cries, but all too late,
     Holds out his hands, and deprecates his fate;
     Still at his mother's neck he fondly aims,
     And strives to melt her with endearing names;
     Yet still the cruel mother perserveres,
     Nor with concern his bitter anguish hears.
     This might suffice; but Philomela too
     Across his throat a shining cutlass drew."

	Or perhaps the reference, is to the Homeric legend of
Philomela, ^Odyssey~, XIX. 518: "As when the daughter of
Pardarus, the swarthy nightingale, sings beautifully when the
spring newly begins, sitting in the thick branches of trees, and
she, frequently changing, pours forth her much-sounding voice,
lamenting her dear Itylus, whom once she slew with the brass
through ignorance."

	|25. Esther~ vii. 9, 10: "And Harbonah, one of the
chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows,
fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had
spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.  Then
the king said, Hang him thereon.  So they hanged Haman on the
gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.  Then was the king's
wrath pacified."

	|34.~  Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus and Queen Amata,
betrothed to Turnus.  Amata, thinking Turnus dead, hanged herself
in anger and despair.  ^AEneid~, XII. 875, Dryden's Tr.: --

	"Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear The mighty grief,
she loathes the vital air.  She calls herself the cause of all
this ill, And owns the dire effects of her ungoverned will; She
raves against the gods, she beats her breast, She tears with both
her hands her purple vest; Then round a beam a running noose she
tied, And, fastened by the neck, obscenely died.  "Soon as the
fatal news by fame was blown, And to her dames and to her
daughters known, The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair And rosy
cheeks; the rest her sorrow share; With shrieks the palace rings,
and madness of despair."

	|53.~  See ^Par.~ V. 134: --

	"Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself
  By too much light."

And Milton, ^Parad. Lost~, III. 380: --

     "Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear."

	|68.~  Matthew v. 9: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for
they shall be called the children of God."

	|85.~  Sloth.  See ^Inf.~ VII.  Note 115.  And Brunetto
Latini, ^Tesoretto~, XXI. 145: --

     "In ira nasce e posa
     Accidia niquitosa."

	|97.~  The first, the object; the second, too much or too
little vigor.

	|124.~  The sins of Pride, Envy, and Anger.  The other is
Sloth, or luke-warmness in well-doing, punished in this cicle.

	|136.~  The sins of Avarice, Gluttony, and Lust.
