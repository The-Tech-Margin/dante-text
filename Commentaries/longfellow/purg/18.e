	|1.~  The punishment of the sin of Sloth.

	|27.~  Bound or taken captive by the image of pleasure
presented to it.  See Canto XVII. 91.

	|22.~  Milton, ^Parad. Lost~, V. 100: --

	        "But know that in the soul
     Are many lesser faculties, that serve
     Reason as chief; among these Fancy next
     Her office holds; of all external things,
     Which the five watchful senses represent,
     She forms imaginations, aery shapes,
     Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
     All what we affirm or what deny, and call
     Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
     Into her private cell, when Nature rests."

	|30.~  The region of Fire, Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, Ch.
CVIII.: "After the zone of the air is placed the fourth element.
This is an orb of fire without any moisture, which extends as far
as the moon, and surrounds this atmosphere in which we are.  And
know that above the fire is first the moon, and the other stars,
which are all of the nature of fire."

	|44.~  If the soul follows the ^appetitus naturalis~, or
goes not with another foot than that of nature.

	|49.~  In the language of the Scholastics, Form was the
passing from the potential to the actual."Whatever is Act." says
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa Theol.~, Quaest. LXVI. Art. I, "whatever
is Act is Form; ^quod est actus est forma.~"  And again Form was
divided into Substantial Form, which caused a thing to be; and
Accidental Form, which caused it to be in a certain way, "as heat
makes its subject not simply to be, but to be hot."

	"The soul," says the same Angelic Doctor, Quaest.  LXXVI.
Art. 4, "is the substantial form of man; ^anima est forma
substantialis hominis.~"  It is segregate or distinct from
matter, though united with it.

	|61.~  "This" refers to the power that counsels, or
faculty of Reason.

	|66.~  Accepts, or rejects like chaff.

	|73.~  Dante makes Beatrice say, ^Par.~ V. 19: --

	"The greatest gift that in his largess God
  Creating made, and unto his own goodness
  Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize Most highly, is
the freedom of the will,
  Wherewith the creatures of intelligence
  Both all and only were and are endowed."

	|76.~  Near midnight of the Second Day of Purgatory.

	|80.~  The moon was rising in the sign or the Scorpion,
it being now five days after the full; and when the sun is in
this sign, it is seen by the inhabitants of Rome to set between
the islands of Corsica and Sardinia.

	|83.~  Virgil, born at Pietola, near Mantua.

	|84.~  The burden of Dante's doubts and questions, laid
upon Virgil.

	|91.~  Rivers or Boeotia, on whose banks the Thebans
crowded at night to invoke the aid of Bacchus to give them rain
for their vineyards.

	|94.~  The word ^falcare~, in French ^faucher~, here
translated "curve," is a term of equitation, describing the
motion of the outer fore-leg of a horse in going round in a
circle.  It is the sweep of a mower's scythe.

	|100.~  Luke i. 39: "And Mary arose in those days and
went into the hill-country with haste."

	|101.~  Caesar on his way to subdue Ilerda, now Lerida,
in Spain, besieged Marseilles, leaving there part of his army
under Brutus to complete the work.

	|118.~  Nothing is known of this Abbot, not even his
name.  Finding him here, the commentators make bold to say that
he was "slothful and deficient in good deeds."  This is like some
of the definitions in the ^Crusca~, which, instead of the
interpretation of a Dantesque word, give you back the passage in
which it occurs.

	|119.~  This is the famous Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
who, according to the German popular tradition, is still sitting
in a cave in the Kippha,user mountains, waiting for something to
happen, while his beard has grown through the stone-table before
him.  In 1162 he burned and devastated Milan, Brescia, Piacenza,
and Cremona.  He was drowned in the Salef in Armenia, on his
crusade in 1190, endeavoring to ford the river on horseback in
his impatience to cross.  His character is thus drawn by Milman,
Lat. Christ.~, Book VIII. Ch. 7, and sufficiently explains why
Dante calls him "the good Barbarossa": --

     "Frederick was a prince of intrepid valor, consummate
     prudence, unmeasured ambition, justice which hardened into
     severity, the ferocity of a barbarian somewhat tempered with
     a high chivalrous gallantry; above all, with a strength of
     character which subjugated alike the great temporal and
     ecclesiastical princes of Germany; and was prepared to
     assert the Imperial rights in Italy to the utmost.  Of the
     constitutional rights of the Emperor, of his unlimited
     supremacy, his absolute independence of, his temporal
     superiority over, all other powers, even that of the Pope,
     Frederick proclaimed the loftiest notions.  He was to the
     Empire what Hildebrand and Innocent were to the Popedom.
     His power was of God alone; to assert that it was bestowed
     by the successor of St. Peter was a lie, and directly
     contrary to the doctrine of St. Peter."

	|121.~  Alberto della Scala, Lord of Verona.  He made his
natural son, whose qualifications for the office Dante here
enumerates, and the commentators repeat, Abbot of the Monastery
of San Zeno.

	|132.~  See ^Inf.~ VII. Note 115.

	|135. Numbers~ xxxii. 11, 12: "Surely none of the men
that came out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall
see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto
Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: save Caleb the
son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun; for
they have wholly followed the Lord."

	|137.~  The Trojans who remained with Acestes in Sicily,
instead of following AEneas to Italy.  ^AEneid~, V.: "They enroll
the matrons for the city, and set on shore as many of the people
as were willing, -- souls that had no desire of high renown."

	|145.~  The end of the Second Day.
