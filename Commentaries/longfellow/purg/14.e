	|1.~  The subject of the preceding canto is here
continued.  Compare the introductory lines with those of Canto V.

	|7.~  These two spirits prove to be Guido del Duca and
Rinieri da Calboli.

	|17.~  A mountain in the Apennines, northeast of
Florence, from which the Arno takes its rise.  Amp@ere, ^Voyage
Dantesque~, p. 246, thus describes this region of the Val d'Arno.

     "Farther on is another tower, the tower of ^Porciano~, which
     is said to have been inhabited by Dante.  From there I had
     still to climb the summits of the Falterona.  I started
     towards midnight in order to arrive before sunrise.  I said
     to myself, How many times the poet, whose footprints I am
     following, has wandered in these mountains!  It was by these
     little alpine paths that he came and went, on his way to
     friends in Romagna or friends in Urbino, his heart agitated
     with a hope that was never to be fulfilled.  I figured to
     myself Dante walking with a guide under the light of the
     stars, receiving all the impressions produced by wild and
     weather-beaten regions, steep roads, deep valleys, and the
     accidents of a long and difficult route, impressions which
     he would transfer to his poem.  It is enough to have read
     this poem to be certain that its author has travelled much,
     has wandered much.  Dante really walks with Virgil.  He
     fatigues himself with climbing, he stops to take breath, he
     uses his hands when feet are insufficient.  He gets lost,
     and asks the way.  He observes the height of the sun and
     stars.  In a word, one finds the habits and souvenirs of the
     traveller in every verse, or rather at every step of his
     poetic pilgrimage.

     "Dante has certainly climbed the top of the Falterona.  It
     is upon this summit, from which all the Valley of the Arno
     is embraced, that one should read the singular imprecation
     which the poet has uttered against this whole valley.  He
     follows the course of the river, and as he advances marks
     every place he comes to with fierce invective.  The farther
     he goes, the more his hate redoubles in violence and
     bitterness.  It is a piece of topographical satire, of which
     I know no other example."

	|32.~  The Apennines, whose long chain ends in Calabria,
opposite Cape Peloro in Sicily. AEneid~, III. 410, Davidson's
Tr.: --

     "But when, after setting out, the wind shall waft you to the
     Sicilian coast, and the straits of narrow Pelorus shall open
     wider to the eye, veer to the land on the left, and to the
     sea on the left, by a long circuit; fly the right both sea
     and shore.  These lands, they say, once with violence and
     vast desolation convulsed, (such revolutions a long course
     of time is able to produce,) slipped asunder; when in
     continuity both lands were one, the sea rushed impetuously
     between, and by its waves tore the Italian side from that of
     Sicily; and with a narrow frith runs between the fields and
     cities separated by the shores.  Scylla guards the right
     side, implacable Charybdis the left, and thrice with the
     deepest eddies of its gulf swallows up the vast billows,
     headlong in, and again spouts them out by turns high into
     the air, and lashes the stars with the waves."

	And Lucan, ^Phars.~, II.: --

     "And still we see on fair Sicilia's sands
     Where part of Apennine Pelorus stands."

	And Shelley, ^Ode to Liberty~: --

     "O'er the lit waves every AEolian isle
     From Pithecusa to Pelorus
     Howls, and leaps, and glares in chorus."

	|40.~  When Dante wrote this invective against the
inhabitants of the Val d'Arno, he probably had in mind the
following passage of Bo,ethius, ^Cons. Phil.~, IV.  Pros. 3,
Ridpath's Tr.:--

     "Hence it again follows, that everything which strays from
     what is good ceases to be; the wicked therefore must cease
     to be what they were; but that they were formerly men, their
     human shape, which still remains, testifies.  By
     degenerating into wickedness, then, they must cease to be
     men.  But as virtue alone can exalt a man above what is
     human, so it is on the contrary evident, that vice, as it
     divests him of his nature, must sink him below humanity; You
     ought therefore by no means to consider him as a man whom
     vice has rendered vicious.  Tell me, What difference is
     there betwixt a wolf who lives by rapine, and a robber whom
     the desire of another's wealth stimulates to commit all
     manner of violence?  Is there anything that bears a stronger
     resemblance to a wrathful dog who barks at passengers, than
     a man whose dangerous tongue attacks all the world?  What is
     liker to a fox than a cheat, who spreads his snares in
     secret to undermine and ruin you? to a lion, than a furious
     man who is always ready to devour you? to a deer, than a
     coward who is afraid of his own shadow? to an ass, than a
     mortal who is slow, dull, and indolent? to the birds of the
     air, than a man volatile and inconstant? and what, in fine,
     is a debauchee who is immersed in the lowest sensual
     gratifications, but a hog who wallows in the mire?  Upon the
     whole, it is an unquestionable truth that a man who forsakes
     virtue ceases to be a man; and, as it is impossible that he
     can ascend in the scale of beings, he must of necessity
     degenerate and sink into a beast."

	|43.~  The people of Casentino.  Forsyth, ^Italy~, p.
126: --

     "On returning down to the Casentine, we could trace along
     the Arno the mischief which followed a late attempt to clear
     some Apennines of their woods.  Most of the soil, which was
     then loosened from the roots and washed down by the
     torrents, lodged in this plain; and left immense beds of
     sand and large rolling stones on the very spot where Dante
     describes

     `Li ruscelletti che de' verdi colli
       Del Casentin discendon giuso in Arno,
       Facendo i lor canali e freddi e molli.'

     "I was surprised to find so large a town as Bibbiena in a
     country devoid of manufactures, remote from public roads,
     and even deserted by its landholders; for the Niccolini and
     Vecchietti, who posses most of this district, prefer the
     obscurrer pleasures of Florence to their palaces and pre-
     eminence here.  The only commodity with the Casentines trade
     in is pork.  Signore Baglione, a gentleman at whose house I
     slept here, ascribed the superior flavor of their hams,
     which are esteemed the best in Italy and requires no
     cooking, to the dryness of the air, the absence of stagnant
     water, and the quantity of chestnuts given to their hogs.
     Bibbiena has been long renowned for its chestnuts, which the
     peasants dry in a kiln, grind into a sweet flour, and then
     convert into bread, cakes, and ^polenta.~"

	|46.~  The people of Arezzo.  Forsyth, ^Italy~, p. 128:
--

     "The Casentines were no favorites with Dante, who confounds
     the men with their hogs.  Yet, following the ^divine poet~
     down the Arno, we came to a race still more forbidding.  The
     Aretine peasants seem to inherit the coarse, surly visages
     of their ancestors, whom he styles ^Bottoli.~  Meeting one
     girl, who appeared more cheerful than her neighbors, we
     asked her how far it was from Arezzo, and received for
     answer, ^`Quanto c'e.'~

     "The valley widened as we advanced, and when Arezzo
     appeared, the river left us abruptly, wheeling off from its
     environs at a sharp angle, which Dante converts into a
     snout, and points disdainfully against the currish
     race......

     "On entering the Val di Chiana, we passed through a
     peasantry more civil and industrious than their Aretine
     neighbors.  One poor girl, unlike the last whom we accosted,
     was driving a laden ass, bearing a billet of wood on her
     hand, spinning with the rocca, and singing as she went on.
     Others were returning with their sickles from the fields
     which they had reaped in the Maremma, to their own harvest
     on the hills.  That contrast which struck me in the manners
     of two cantons so near as Cortona to Arezzo, can only be a
     vestige of their ancient rivality while separate republics.
     Men naturally dislike the very virtues of their enemies, and
     affect qualities as remote from theirs as they can well
     defend."

	|50.~  The Florentines.

	|53.~  The Pisans.

	|57.~  At the close of these vituperations, perhaps to
soften the sarcasm by making it more general, Benvenuto appends
this note: "What Dante says of the inhabitants of the Val d'Arno
might be said of the greater part of the Italians, nay, of the
world.  Dante, being once asked why he had put more Christians
than Gentiles into Hell, replied, `Because I have known the
Christians better.'"

	|58.~  Messer Fulcieri da Calboli of Forl@i, nephew of
Rinieri.  He was Podest@a of Florence in 1302, and, being bribed
by the Neri, had many of the Bianchi put to death.

	|64.~  Florence, the habitation of these wolves, left so
stripped by Fulcieri, on his retiring from office, that it will
be long in recovering its former prosperity.

	|81.~  Guido del Duca of Brettinor, near Forl@i, in
Romagna; nothing remains but the name.  He and his companion
Rinieri were "gentlemen of worth, if they had not been burned up
with envy."

	|87.~  On worldly goods, where selfishness excludes
others; in contrast with the spiritual, which increase by being
shared.  See Canto XV. 45.

	|88.~  Rinieri da Calboli."He was very famous," says the
^Ottimo~, and history says no more.  In the ^Cento Novelle
Antiche~, Nov. 44, Roscoe's Tr., he figures thus: --

     "A certain knight was one day entreating a lady whom he
     loved to smile upon his wishes, and among other delicate
     arguments which he pressed upon her was that of his own
     superior wealth, elegance, and accomplishments, especially
     when compared with the merits of her own liege-lord, `whose
     extreme ugliness, madam,' he continued, `I think I need not
     insist upon.' Her husband, who overheard this compliment
     from the place of his concealment, immediately replied,
     `Pray, sir, mend your own manners, and do not vilify other
     people.'  The name of the plain gentleman was Lizio di
     Valbona, and messer Rinieri da Calvoli that of the other.

	|92.~  In Romagna, which is bounded by the Po, the
Apennines, the Adriatic, and the river Reno, that passes near
Bologna.

	|93.~  For study and pleasure.

	|97.~  Of Lizio and Manardi the ^Ottimo~ says: "Messer
Lizio di Valbona, a courteous gentleman, in order to give a
dinner at Forl@i, sold half his silken bedquilt for sixty
florins.  Arrigo Manardi was of Brettinoro; he was a gentleman
full of courtesy and honour, was fond of entertaining guests,
made presents of robes and horses, loved honourable men, and all
his life was devoted to largess and good living."

	The marriage of Riccardo Manardi with Lizio's daughter
Caterina is the subject of one of the tales of the ^Decameron~,
V. 4.  Pietro Dante says, that, when Lizio was told of the death
of his dissipated son, he replied, "It is no news to me, he never
was alive."

	|98.~  Of Pier Traversaro the ^Ottimo~ says: "He was of
Ravenna, a man of most gentle blood"; and of Guido di Carpigna:
"He was of Montefeltro. ....Most of the time he lived at
Brettinoro, and surpassed all others in generosity, loved for the
sake of loving, and lived handsomely."

	|100.~  "This Messer Fabbro," says the ^Ottimo~, "was
born of low parents, and lived so generously that the author
(Dante) says there never was his like in Bologna."

	|101.~  The ^Ottimo~ again: "This Messer Bernardino, son
of Fosco, a farmer, and of humble occupation, became so excellent
by his good works, that he was an honor to Faenza; and he was
named with praise, and the old grandees were not ashamed to visit
him, to see his magnificence, and to hear his pleasant jests."

	|104.~  Guido da Prata, from the village of that name,
between Faenza and Forl@i, and Ugolin d'Azzo of Faenza, according
to the same authority, though "of humble birth, rose to such
great honor, that, leaving their native places, they associated
with the noblemen before mentioned."

	|106.~  Frederick Tignoso was a gentleman of Rimini,
living in Brettinoro.  "A man of great mark," says Buti, "with
his band of friends."  According to Benvenuto, "he had beautiful
blond hair, andwas called ^tignoso~ (the scurvy fellow) by way of
antiphrase."  The ^Ottimo~ speaks of him as follows: "He avoided
the city as much as possible, as a place hostile to gentlemen,
but when he was in it, he kept open house."

	|107.~  Ancient and honorable families of Ravenna.  There
is a story of them in the ^Decameron~, Gior. V. Nov. 8, which is
too long to quote.  Upon this tale is founded Dryden's poem of
^Theodore and Honaria.~

	|109.~  Ariosto, ^Orlando Furioso~, I. 1: --

     "The dames, the cavaliers, the arms, the loves,
     The courtesies, the daring deeds I sing."

	|112.~  Brettinoro, now Bertinoro, is a small town in
Romagna, between Forl@i and Cesena, in which lived many of the
families that have jut been mentioned.  The hills about it are
still celebrated for their wines, as its inhabitants were in old
times for their hospitality.  The following anecdote is told of
them by the ^Ottimo~, and also in nearly the same words in the
^Cento Novelle Antiche~, Nov. 89: --

     "Among other laudable customs of the nobles of Brettinoro
     was that of hospitality, and their not permitting any man in
     the town to keep an inn for money.  But there was a stone
     column in the middle of the town," (upon which were rings or
     knockers, as if all the front-doors were there represented,)
     "and to this, as soon as a stranger made his appearance, he
     was conducted, and to one of the rings hitched his horse or
     hung his hat upon it; and thus, as chance decreed, he was
     taken to the house of the gentleman to whom the ring
     belonged, and honored according to his rank.  This column
     and its rings were invented to remove all cause of quarrel
     among the noblemen, who used to run to get possession of a
     stranger, as now-a-days they almost run away from him."

	|115.~  Towns in Romagna.  "Bagnacavallo, and Castrocaro,
and Conio," says the ^Ottimo~, "were all habitations of courtesy
and honour.  Now in Bagnacavallo the Counts are extinct; and he
(Dante) says it does well to produce no more of them because they
had degenerated like those of Conio and Castrocaro.

	|118.~  The Pagani were Lords of Faenza and Imola.  The
head of the family, Mainardo, was surnamed "the Devil." -- See
^Inf.~ XXVII. Note 49.  His bad repute will always be a reproach
to the family.

	|121.~  A nobleman of Faenza, who died without heirs, and
thus his name was safe.

	|132.~  Milton, ^Comus~: --

     Of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire,
     And airy tongues that syllable men's names."

	These voices in the air proclaim examples of envy.

	|133. Genesis~ iv. 13, 14: "And Cain said unto the
Lord,.....Every one that findeth me shall slay me."

	|139.~  Aglauros through envy opposed the interview of
Mercury with her sister Herse, and was changed by the god into
stone.  Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, I., Addison's Tr.: --

     `Then keep thy seat forever,' cries the god,
     And touched the door, wide opening to his rod.
     Fain would she rise and stop him, but she found
     Her trunk too heavy to forsake the ground;
     Her joints are all benumbed, her hands are pale,
     And marble now appears in every nail.
     As when a cancer in the body feeds,
     And gradual death from limb to limb proceeds,
     So does the chillness to each vital part
     Spread by degrees, and creeps into her heart;
     Till hardening everywhere, and speechless grown,
     She sits unmoved, and freezes to a stone.
     But still her envious hue and sullen mien
     Are in the sedentary figure seen."

	|147.~  The falconer's call or lure, which he whirls
round in the air to attract the falcon on the wing.

	|148.~  Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, I., Dryden's Tr.: --

     "Thus, while the mute creation downward bend
     Their sight, and their earthly mother tend,
     Man looks aloft; and with erected eyes
     Beholds his own hereditary skies."

	|150.~  Beaumont and Fletcher, ^The Laws of Candy~, IV.
1: --

     "Seldom despairing men look up to heaven,
     Althoug it still speak to `em in its glories;
     For when sad thoughts perplex the mind of Man,
     There is a plummet in the heart that weighs
     And pulls us, living, to te dust we came from."
