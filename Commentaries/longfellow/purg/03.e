	|27.~  The tomb of Virgil is on the promontory of
Pausilippo, overlooking the Bay of Naples.  The inscription upon
it is:--

     Mantua me genuit: Calabri rapuere: tenet nunc
       Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.

	"The epitaph," says Eustace, ^Classical ^Tour~, I. 499,
"which, though not genuine, is yet ancient, was inscribed by
order of the Duke of Pescolangiano, then proprietor of the place,
on a marble slab placed in the side of the rock opposite the
entrance of the tomb, where it still remains."

	Forsyth, ^Italy~, p. 378, says: "^Virgil's tomb~ is so
called, I believe, on the single authority of Donatus.  Donatus
places it at the right distance from Naples, but on the wrong
side of the city; and even there he omits the grotto of Posilipo,
which not being so deep in his time as the two last excavations
have left it, must have opened precisely at his tomb.  Donatus,
too, gives, for Virgil's own composition, an epitaph on the cliff
now rejected as a forgery.  And who is this Donatus?  -- an
obscure grammarian, or rather his counterfeit.  The structure
itself resembles a ruined pigeon-house, where the numerous
^columbaria~ would indicate a family-sepulchre: but who should
repose in the tomb of Virgil, but Virgil alone?  Visitors of
every nation, kings and princes, have scratched their names on
the stucco of this apocryphal ruin, but the poet's awful name
seems to have deterred them from versifying here."

	|49.~  Places on the mountainous seaside road from Genoa
to Pisa, known as the ^Riviera di Levante.~  Of this, Mr.
Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 243, says:--

     "The similes by which he illustrates the steepness of that
     ascent are all taken from the Riviera of Genoa, now
     traversed by a good carriage road under the name of the
     Cornice; but as this road did not exist in Dante's time, and
     the steep precipices and promontories were then probably
     traversed by footpaths, which, as they necessarily passed in
     many places over crumbling and slippery limestone, were
     doubtless not a little dangerous, and as in the manner they
     commanded the bays of sea below, and lay exposed to the full
     blaze of the southeastern sun, they corresponded precisely
     to the situation of the path by which he ascends above the
     purgatorial sea, the image could not possibly have been
     taken from a better source for the fully conveying his idea
     to the reader: nor, by the way, is there reason to
     discredit, in ^this~ place, his powers of climbing; for,
     with his usual accuracy, he has taken the angle of the path
     for us, saying it was considerable more than forty-five.
     Now a continuous mountain slope of forty-five degrees is
     already quite unsafe either for ascent or descent, except by
     zigzag paths; and a greater slope than this could not be
     climbed, straightforward, but by help of crevices or jags in
     the rock, and great physical exertion besides."

	Mr. Norton, ^Travel and Study~, p. I, thus describes the
Riviera:

     "The Var forms the geographical boundary between France and
     Italy; but it is not till Nice is left behind, and the first
     height of the Riviera is surmounted, that the real Italy
     begins.  Here the hills close round at the north, and
     suddenly, as the road turns at the top of a long ascent, the
     Mediterranean appears far below, washing the feet of the
     mountains that form the coast, and stretching away to the
     Southern horizon.  The line of the shore is of extraordinary
     beauty.  Here an abrupt cliff rises from the sea; here bold
     and broken masses of rock jut out into it; here the hills,
     their gray sides terraced for vineyards, slope gently down
     to the water's edge; here they stretch into little
     promontories covered with orange and olive-trees.

     "One of the first of these promontories is that of Capo
     Sant' Ospizio.  A close grove of olives half conceals the
     old castle on its extreme point.  With the afternoon sun
     full upon it, the trees palely glimmering as their leaves
     move in the light air, the sea so blue and smooth as to be
     like a darker sky, and not even a ripple upon the beach,, it
     seems as if this were the very home of summer and of repose.
     It is remote and secluded from the stir and noise of the
     world.  No road is seen leading to it, and one looks down
     upon the solitary castle and wonders what stories of
     enchantment and romance belong to a ruin that appears as if
     made for their dwelling-place.  It is a scene out of that
     Italy which is the home of the imagination, and which
     becomes the Italy of memory.

     "As the road winds down to the sea, it passes under a high
     isolated peak, on which stands Esa, built as a city of
     refuge against pirates and Moors.  A little farther on,

     `Its Roman strength Turbia showed
     In ruins by the mountain road,'--

     not only recalling the ancient times, when it was the 
     boundary city of Italy and Gaul, and when Augustus erected 
     his triumphal arch within it, but associated also with 
     Dante and the steep of Purgatory.  Beneath lies Monaco, 
     glowing `like a gem' on its oval rock, the sea sparkling 
     around it, and the long western rays of the sinking sun 
     lingering on its little palace, clinging to its church 
     belfry and its gray wall, as if loath to leave them."

	In the Casa Magni, on the sea-shore near Lerici, Shelley
once lived.  He was returning thither from Leghorn, when he
perished in a sudden storm at sea.

	|112.~  Manfredi, king of Apulia and Sicily, was a
natural son of the Emperor Frederick the Second.  He was slain at
the battle of Benevento, in 1265; one of the great and decisive
battles of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Guelph or Papal
forces being commanded by Charles of Anjou, and the Ghibellines
or Imperialists by Manfredi.

	Malispini, ^Storia~, ch. 187, thus describes his death
and burial: "Manfredi, being left with few followers, behaved
like a valiant gentleman who preferred to die in battle rather
than to escape with shame.  And putting on his helmet, which had
on it a silver eagle for a crest, this eagle fell on the saddle-
bow before him; and seeing this he was greatly disturbed, and
said in Latin to the barons who were near him, `^Hoc est signum
Dei~; for this crest I fastened on with my own hands in such a
way that it could not fall.'  But he was not discouraged, and
took heart, and went into battle like any other baron, without
the royal insignia, in order not to be recognized.  But short
while it lasted, for his forces were already in flight; and they
were routed and Manfredi slain in the middle of the enemy; and
they were driven into the town by the soldiers of King Charles,
for it was now night, and they lost the city of Benevento.  And
many of Manfredi's barons were made prisoners, among whom were
the Count Giordano, Messer Piero Asino degli Uberti, and many
others, whom King Charles sent captive into Provence, and there
had them put to death in prison; and he imprisoned many other
Germans in different parts of the kingdom.  And a few days
afterwards the wife of Manfredi and his children and his sister,
who were in Nocera de' Sardini in Apulia, were taken prisoners by
Charles; these died in prison. And for more than three days they
made search after Manfredi; for he could not be found, nor was it
known if he were dead, or a prisoner, or had escaped; because he
had not worn his royal robes in the battle.  And afterwards he
was recognized by one of his own camp-followers, from certain
marks upon his person, in the middle of the battle-field; and he
threw him across an ass, and came shouting, `Who will buy
Manfredi?' for which a baron of the king beat him with a cane.
And the body of Manfredi being brought to King Charles, he
assembled all the barons who were prisoners, and asked each one
if that was Manfredi; and timidly they answered yes.  Count
Giordano smote himself in the face with his hands, weeping and
crying, `O my lord!' whereupon he was much commended by the
French, and certain Bretons besought that he might have honorable
burial.  Answered the king and said, `I would do it willingly, if
he were not excommunicated'; and on that account he would not
have him laid in consecrated ground, but he was buried at the
foot of the bridge of Benevento, and each one of the army threw a
stone upon his grave, so that a great pile was made.  But
afterwards, it is said, by command of the Pope, the Bishop of
Cosenza took him from that grave, and sent him out of the
kingdom, because it was Church land.  And he was buried by the
river Verde, at the confines of the kingdom and the Campagna.
This battle was on a Friday, the last day of February, in the
year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five."

	Villani, who in his account of the battle copies
Malispini almost literally, gives in another chapter, VI. 46, the
following portrait of Manfredi; but it must be remembered that
Villani was a Guelph, and Manfredi a Ghibelline.

     "King Manfredi had for his mother a beautiful lady of the
     family of the Marquises of Lancia in Lombardy, with whom the
     Emperor had an intrigue, and was beautiful in person, and
     like his father and more than his father was given to
     dissipation of all kinds.  He was a musician and singer,
     delighted in the company of buffoons and courtiers and
     beautiful concubines, and was always clad in green; he was
     generous and courteous, and of good demeanor, so that he was
     much be-loved and gracious; but his life was wholly
     epicurean, hardly caring for God or the saints, but for the
     delights of the body.  He was an enemy of holy Church, and
     of priests and monks, confiscating churches as his father
     had done; and a wealthy gentleman was he, both from the
     treasure which he inherited form the Emperor, and from King
     Conrad, his brother, and from his own kingdom, which was
     ample and fruitful, and which, so long as he lived,
     notwithstanding all the wars he had with the Church, he kept
     in good condition, so that it rose greatly in wealth and
     power, both by sea and by land."

	This battle of Benevento is the same as that mentioned
^Inf.~ XXVIII. 16: --

          "At Ceperano, where a renegade 
     Was each Apulian."

Fourth.

	|131.~  The name of the river Verde reminds one of the
old Spanish ballad, particularly when one recalls the fact that
Manfredi had in his army a band of Saracens:--

     "Rio Verde, Rio Verde,
       Many a corpse is bathed in thee, 
     Both of Moors and eke of Christians,
       Slain with swords most cruelly."

	|132.~  Those who died "in contumely of holy Church," or
under excommunication, were buried with extinguished and inverted
torches.
