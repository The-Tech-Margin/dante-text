     "And he soothes Pasiphae in her passion for the snow-white
     bull: happy woman if herds had never been!  Ah, ill-fated
     maid, what madness seized thee?  The daughters of Proteus
     with imaginary lowings filled the fields; yet none of them
     pursued such vile embraces of a beast, however they might
     dread the plough about their necks, and often feel for horns
     on their smooth foreheads.  Ah, ill-fated maid, thou now art
     roaming on the mountains!  He, resting his snowy side on the
     soft hyacinth, ruminates the blenched herbs under some
     gloomy oak, or courts some female in the numerous herd."

	|92.~  Guido Guinicelli, the best of the Italian poets
before Dante, flourished in the first half of the thirteenth
century.  He was a native of Bologna, but of his life nothing is
known. His most celebrated poem is a Canzone on the Nature of
Love, which goes far to justify the warmth and tenderness of
Dante's praise.  Rossetti, ^Early Italian Poets~, p. 24, gives
the following version of it, under the title of ^The Gentle
Heart~: --

     "Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,
       As birds within the green shade of the grove.
     Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme,
       Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.
	 For with the sun, at once,
     So sprang the light immediately; nor was
	 Its birth before the sun's.
       And Love hath his effect in gentleness
	 Of very self; even as
       Within the middle fire the heat's excess.

     "The fire of Love comes to the gentle heart
       Like as its virtue to a precious stone;
     To which no star its influence can impart
       Till it is made a pure thing by the sun:
     For when the sun hath smit
       From out its essence that which there was vile,
	 The star endoweth it.
     And so the heart created by God's breath
	 Pure, true, and clean from guile,
     A woman, like a star, enamoreth.

     "In gentle heart Love for like reason is
       For which the lamp's high flame is fanned bowed:
     Clear, piercing bright, it shines for its own bliss;
       Nor would it burn there else, it is so proud.
	 For evil natures meet
     With Love as it were water met with fire,
	 As cold abhorring heat.
     Through gentle heart Love doth a track divine, --
	 Like knowing like; the same
     As diamond runs through iron in the mine.

     "The sun strikes full upon the mud all day;
       It remains vile, nor the sun's worth is less.
     `By race I am gentle,' the proud man doth say:
       He is the mud, the sun is gentleness.
	 Let no man predicate
     That aught the name of gentleness should have,
	 Even in a king's estate,
     Except the heart there be a gentle man's.
	 The star-beam lights the wave, --
     Heaven holds the star and the star's radiance.

     "God, is the understanding of high Heaven,
       Burns more than in our sight the living sun:
     Here to behold His Face unveiled is given;
       And Heaven, whose will is homage paid to One,
	 Fulfils the things which live
     In God, from the beginning excellent.
	 So should my lady give
     That truth which in her eyes is glorified,
	 On which her heart is bent,
     To me whose service waiteth at her side.

     "My lady, God shall ask, `What daredst thou?'
       (When my soul stands with all her acts reviewed;)
     `Thou passedst Heaven, into My sight, as now,
       To make Me of vain love similitude.
	 To Me doth praise belong,
     And to the Queen of all the realm of grace
	 Who endeth fraud and wrong.'
     Then may I plead: `As though from Thee he came,
	 Love wore an angel's face:
     Lord, if I loved her, count it not my shame.'"

	|94.~  Hypsipyle was discovered and rescued by her sons
Eumenius and Thoas, (whose father was the "bland Jason," (as
Statius calls him,) just as King Lycurgus in his great grief was
about to put her to death for neglecting the care of his child,
who through her neglect had been stung by a serpent.

	Statius, ^Thebaid~, V. 949, says it was Tydeus who saved
Hysiple: --

     "But interposing Tydeus rushed between,
     And with his shield protects the Lemnian queen."

	|118.~  In the old Romance languages the name of ^prosa~
was applied generally to all narrative poems, and particularly to
the monorhythmic romances.  Thus Gonzalo de Berceo, a Spanish
poet of the thirteenth century, begins a poem on the ^Vida del
Glorioso Confessor Santo Domingo de Silos~: --

     "De un confessor Sancto quiero fer una prosa,
     Quiero fer una prosa en roman paladino,
     En qual suele el pueblo fablar $a su vecino,
     Ca non so tan letrado per fer otro Latino."

	|120.~  Gerault de Berneil of Limoges, born of poor
parents, but a man of talent and learning, was one of the most
famous Troubadours of the thirteenth century.  The old Provenal
biographer, quoted y Raynouard, ^Choix de Po$esies~, V. 166,
says: "He was a better poet than any who preceded or followed
him, and was therefore called the Master of the Troubadours.....
He passed his winters in study, and his summers in wandering from
court to court with two minstrels who sang his songs."

	The following specimen of his poems is from [Taylor's]
^Lays of the Minnesingers and Troubadours~, p. 247.  It is an
^Aubade~, or song o the morning: --

     "Companion dear! or sleeping or awaking,
       Sleep not again! for lo! the morn is nigh,
     And in the east that early star is breaking,
       The day's forerunner, known unto mine eye;
	 The morn, the morn is near.

     "Companion dear! with carols sweet I call thee;
       Sleep not again!  I hear the birds' blithe song
     Loud in the woodlands; evil may befall thee,
       And jealous eyes awaken, tarrying long,
	 Now that the morn is near.

     "Companion dear! forth from the window looking,
       Attentive mark the signs of yonder heaven;
     Judge if aright I read what they betoken:
       Thine all the loss, if vain the warning given;
	 The morn, the morn is near.

     "Companion dear! since thou from hence wert straying,
       Nor sleep nor rest these eyes have visited;
     My prayers unceasing to the Virgin paying,
       That thou in peace thy backward way might tread.
	 The morn, the morn is near.

     "Companion dear! hence to the fields with me!
       Me thou forbad'st to slumber through the night,
     And I have watched that livelong night for thee;
       But thou in song or me hast no delight,
	 And now the morn is near.

ANSWER.

     "Companion dear! so happily sojourning,
       So blest am I, I care not forth to speed:
     Here brightest beauty reigns, her smiles adorning
       Her dwelling-place, -- then wherefore should I heed
	 The morn or jealous eyes?"

	According to Nostrodamus he died in 1278.
Notwithstanding his great repute, Dante gives the palm of
excellence to Arnaud Daniel, his rival and contemporary.  But
this is not the general verdict of literary history.

	|124.~  Fra Guittone d'Arezzo.  See Canto XXIV. Note 56.

	|137.~  Venturi has the indiscretion to say: "This is a
disgusting compliment after the manner of the French; in the
Italian fashion we should say, `You will do me a favor, if you
will tell me your name.'"  Whereupon Biagioli thunders at him in
this wise: "Infamous dirty dog that you are, how can you call
this a compliment after the manner of the French?  How can you
set off against it what any cobbler might say?  Away! and a
murrain on you!"

	|142.~  Arnaud Daniel, the Troubadour of the thirteenth
century, whom Dante lauds so highly, and whom Petrarca calls "the
Grand Master of Love," was born of a noble family at the castle
of Ribeyrac in P@erigord.  Millot, ^Hist. des Troub.~, II. 479,
says of him: "In all ages there have been false reputations,
founded on some individual judgment, whose authority has
prevailed without examination, until at last criticism discusses,
the truth penetrates, and the phantom of prejudice vanishes.
Such has been the reputation of Arnaud Daniel."

	Raynouard confirms this judgment, and says that, "reading
the works of this Troubadour, it is difficult to conceive the
causes of the great celebrity he enjoyed during his life."

	Arnaud Daniel was the inventor of the ^Sestina~, a song
of six stanzas of six lines each, with the same rhymes repeated
in all, through arranged in different and intricate order, which
must be seen to be understood.  He was also author of the
metrical romance of ^Lancillotto~, or Launcelot of the Lake, to
which Dante doubtless refers in his expression ^prose di
romanzi~, or proses of romance.  The following anecdote is from
the old Proven$cal authority, quoted both by Millot and
Raynouard, and is thus translated by Miss Costello, ^Early Poetry
of France~, p. 37: --

     "Arnaud visited the court of Richard Coeur de Lion in
     England, and encountered there a jongleur, who defied him to
     a trial of skill, and boasted of being able to make more
     difficult rhymes than Arnaud, a proficiency on which he
     chiefly prided himself.  He accepted the challenge, and the
     two poets separated, and retired to their respective
     chambers to prepare for the contest.  The Muse of Arnaud was
     not propitious, and he vainly endeavored to string two
     rhymes together.  His rival, on the other hand, quickly
     caught the inspiration.  The king had allowed ten days as
     the term of preparation, five for composition, and the
     remainder for learning it by heart to sing before the court.
     On the third day the jongleur declared that he had finished
     his poem, and was ready to recite it, but Arnaud replied
     that he had not yet thought of his.  It was the jongleur's
     custom to repeat his verses out loud every day, in order to
     learn them better, and Arnaud, who was in vain endeavoring
     to devise some means to save himself from the mockery of the
     court at being outdone in this contest, happened to overhear
     the jongleur singing.  He went to his door and listened, and
     succeeded in retaining the words and the air.  On the day
     appointed they both appeared before the king.  Arnaud
     desired to be allowed to sing first, and immediately gave
     the song which the jongleur had composed.  The latter,
     stupefied with astonishment, could only exclaim: `It is my
     song, it is my song.'  `Impossible!' cried the king; but the
     jongleur, persisting, requested Richard to interrogate
     Arnaud, who would not dare, he said, to deny it.  Daniel
     confessed the fact, and related the manner in which the
     affair had been conducted, which amused Richard far more
     than the song itself.  The stakes of the wager were restored
     to each, and the king loaded them both with presents."

	According to Nostrodamus, Arnaud died about 1189.  There
is no other reason for making him speak in Proven$cal than the
evident delight which Dante took in the sound of the words, and
the peculiar flavor they give to the close of the canto.
Raynouard says that the writings of none of the Troubadours have
been so disfigured by copyists as those of Arnaud.  This would
seem to be true of the very lines which Dante writes for him; as
there are in least seven different readings of them.

	Here Venturi has again the indiscretion to say that
Arnaud answers Dante in "a kind of ^lingua-franca~, part
Proven$cal and part Catalan, joining together the perfidious
French with the vile Spanish, perhaps to show that Arnaud was a
clever speaker of the two."  And again Biagioli suppresses him
with "that unbridled beast of a Venturi," and this "most potent
argument of his presumptuous ignorance and impertinence."
