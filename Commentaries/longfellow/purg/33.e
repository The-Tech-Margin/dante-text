	|1.~  In this canto Dante is made to drink of the river
Euno,e, the memory of things good.

	^Psalm~ lxxix., beginning: "O God, the heathen are come
into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled."  The
three Evangelical and four Candinal Virtues chant this psalm,
alternately responding to each other.  The Latin words must be
chanted, in order to make the lines rhythmical, with an equal
emphasis on each syllable.

	|7.~  When their singing was ended.

	|10.~  John xvi. 16: "A little while, and ye shall not
see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me; because I
go to the Father."

	|15.~  Dante, Matilda, and Statius.

	|27.~  As in Canto XXXI. 7: --

     "My faculties were in so great confusion,
       That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct
       Than by its organs it was set at large."

	|34.~  Is no longer what it was.  ^Revelation~ xvii. 8:
"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not."

	|36.~  In the olden time in Florence, if an assassin
could contrive to eat a sop of bread and wine at the grave of the
murdered man, within nine days after the murder, he was free from
the vengeance of the family; and to prevent this they kept watch
at the tomb.  There is no evading the vengeance of God in this
way.  Such is the interpretation of this passage by all the old
commentators.

	|37.~  The Roman Empire shall not always be without an
Emperor, as it was then in the eyes of Dante, who counted the
"German Albert," ^Alberto tedesco~, as no Emperor, because he
never came into Italy.  See the appeal to him, Canto VI. 96, and
the malediction, because he suffered.

     "The garden of the empire to be waste."

	|43.~  The Roman numerals making DVX, or Leader.  The
allusion is to Henry of Luxemburgh, in whom Dante placed his
hopes of the restoration of the Imperial power.  He was the
successor of the German Albert of the preceding note, after an
interregnum of one year.  He died in 1312, shortly after his
coronation in Rome.  See Canto VI. Note 97.

	Villani, though a Guelf, pays this tribute of respect to
his memory, Book IX.  Ch. I: "He was wise and just and gracious,
valiant in arms, dignified, and catholic; and although of low
estate in lineage, he was of a magnanimous heart, feared and
redoubted, and if he had lived longer, he would have done great
things."

	When Henry entered Italy in September, 1310, Dante
hastened to meet him, full of faith and hope.  Whether this
interview took place at Susa, Turin, or Milan, is uncertain; nor
is there any record of it, except the allusion in the following
extract from a letter of Dante, "written in Tuscany, at the
sources of the Arno, on the 14th of May, 1311, in the first year
of the happy journey of the divine Henry into Italy."  Dante was
disappointed that his hero should linger so long in the Lombard
towns, and wished him to march at once against Florence, the
monster "that drinketh neither of the headlong Po, nor of thy
Tyber."  In this letter, Mr. Green's Tr., he says: --

     "The inheritance of peace, as the immense love of God
     witnesseth, was left us, that in the marvellous sweetness
     thereof our hard warfare might be softened, and by the use
     thereof we might deserve the joys of our triumphant country.
     But the hatred of the ancient and implacable enemy, who ever
     and secretly layeth snares for human prosperity, --
     disinheriting some of those who were willing, -- impiously,
     in the absence of our protector, despoiled us also, who were
     unwilling.  Wherefore we wept long by the rivers of
     confusion, and incessantly implored the protection of the
     just king, to scatter the satellites of the cruel tyrant,
     and restore us to our just rights.  And when thou, successor
     of Caesar and of Augustus, crossing the chain of the
     Apennines, brought back the venerable Tarpeian ensigns, our
     long sighings straightway ceased, the fountains of our tears
     were stayed, and a new hope of a better age, like a sun
     suddenly risen, shed its beams over Latium.  Then many
     breaking forth into jubilant vows, sang with Mars the
     Saturnian reign, and the return of the Virgin.

     "But since our sun (whether the fervor of desire suggests
     it, or the aspect of truth) is already believed to have
     delayed, or is supposed to be going back in his course, as
     if a new Joshua or the son of Amos had commanded, we are
     compelled in our uncertainty to doubt, and to break forth in
     the words of the Forerunner: `Art thou he that should come,
     or look we for another?'  And although the fury of long
     thirst turns into doubt, as is its wont, the things which
     are certain because they are near, nevertheless we believe
     and hope in thee, asserting thee to be the minister of God,
     and the son of the Church, and the promoter of the Roman
     glory.  And I, who write as well for myself as for others,
     when my hands touched thy feet and my lips performed their
     office, saw thee most benignant, as becometh the Imperial
     majesty, and heard thee most clement.  Then my spirit
     exulted within me, and I silently said to myself, `Behold
     the lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world."

	Dante, ^Par.~ XXX. 133, sees the crown and throne that
await the "noble Henry" in the highest heaven: --

     On that great throne on which thine eyes are fixed
       For the crown's sake already placed upon it,
       Before thou suppest at this wedding feast,
     Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus
       On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come
       To reform Italy ere she be prepared."

	|47.~  Themis, the daughter of Coelus and Terra, whose
oracle was famous in Attica, and who puzzled Deucalion and Pyrrha
by telling them that, in order to repeople the earth after the
deluge, they must throw "their mother's bones behind them."

	The Sphinx, the famous monster born of Chimaera, and
having the head of a woman, the wings of a bird, the body of a
dog, and the paws of a lion; and whose riddle, "What animal walks
on four legs in the morning, on two at noon, and on three at
night?" so puzzled the Thebans, that King Creon offered his crown
and his daughter Jocasta to any one who should solve it, and so
free the land of the uncomfortable monster; a feat accomplished
by OEdipus apparently without much difficulty.

	|49.~  The Naiades having undertaken to solve the enigmas
of oracles, Themis, offended, sent forth a wild beast to ravage
the flocks and fields of the Thebans; though why they should have
been held accountable for the doings of the Naiades is not very
obvious.  The tradition is founded on a passage in Ovid, ^Met.~,
VII. 757: --

     "Carmina Na,iades non itellecta priorum
     Solvunt."

Heinsius and other critics say that the lines should read,

     "Carmina La,iades non intellecta priorum
     Solverat";

referring to OEdipus, son of Laius.  But Rosa Moranda maintains
the old reading, and says there is authority in Pausanias for
making the Naiades interpreters of oracles.

	|54. Coplas de Manrique~: --

     "Our cradle is the starting place,
     Life is the running of the race."

	|57.~  First by the Eagle, who rent its bark and leaves;
then by the giant, who bore away the chariot which had been bound
to it.

	|61.~  The sin of Adam, and the death of Christ.

	|66.~  Widening at the top, instead of diminishing upward
like other trees.

	|68.~  The Elsa is a river in Tuscany, rising in the
mountains near Colle, and flowing northward into the Arno,
between Florence and Pisa.  Its waters have the power of
incrusting or petrifying anything left in them.  "This power of
incrustation," says Covino, ^Descriz. Georg. dell'Italia~, "is
especially manifest a little above Colle, where a great pool
rushes impetuously from the ground."

	|69.~  If the vain thoughts thou hast been immersed in
had not petrified thee, and the pleasure of them stained thee; if
thou hadst not been

     "Converted into stone and stained with sin."

	|78.~  The staff wreathed with palm, the cockle-shell in
the hat, and the sandal-shoon were all marks of the pilgrim,
showing he had been beyond sea and in the Holy Land.  Thus in the
old ballad of ^The Friar of Orders Gray~: --

     "And how should I your truelove know
       From many another one?
     O by his cockle-hat and staff,
       And by his sandal-shoone."

	In the ^Vita Nuova~, Mr. Norton's Tr., p. 71, is this
passage: "Moreover, it is to be known that the people who travel
in the service of the Most High are called by three distinct
terms.  Those who go beyond the sea, whence often they bring back
the palm, are called ^palmers.~  Those who go to the house of
Galicia are called ^pilgrims~, because the burial-place of St.
James was more distant from his country than that of any other of
the Apostles.  And those are called ^romei~ who go to Rome."

	|85.~  How far Philosophy differs from Religion. Isaih
lv.  8: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
ways my ways, saith the Lord.  For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."

	|104.~  Noon of the Fourth Day of Purgatory.

	|112.~  Two of the four rivers that watered Paradise.
Here they are the same as Lethe and Euno,e, the oblivion of evil,
and the memory of good.

	|127.~  Bunyan, ^Pilgrim's Progress~: --

     "I saw then, that they went on their way to a pleasant
     river, which David the king called `the river of God'; but
     John, `the river of the water of life.'  Now their way lay
     just upon the bank of the river: here therefore Christian
     and his companion walked with great delight: they drank also
     of the water of the river, which was pleasant, and
     enlivening to their weary spirits.  Besides, on the banks of
     this river, on either side, were green trees for all manner
     of fruit; and the leaves they ate to prevent surfeits and
     other diseases that are incident to those that heat their
     blood by travels.  On either side of the river was also a
     meadow, curiously beautified with lilies; and it was green
     all the year long.  In this meadow they lay down and slept;
     for here they might lie down safely.  When they awoke, they
     gathered again of the fruits of the trees, and drank again
     of the water of the river, and then lay down again to
     sleep."

	|129.~  Sir John Denham says: --

     "The sweetest cordial we receive at last
     Is conscience of our virtuous actions past."

	|145.~  The last word in this division of the poem, as in
the other two, is the suggestive word "Stars."
