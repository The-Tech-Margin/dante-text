	|1.~  The Heaven of the Sun, "a good planet and imperial,"
says Brunetto Latini.  Dante makes it the symbol of Arithmetic.
^Convito~, II. 14: "The Heaven of the Sun may be compared to
Arithmetic on account of two properties; the first is, that with
its light all the other stars are informed; the second is, that
the eye cannot behold it.  And these two properties are in
Arithmetic, for with its light all the sciences are illuminated,
since their subjects are all considered under some numbers, and
in the consideration thereof we always proceed with numbers; as
in natural science the subject is the movable body, which movable
body has in it raton of continuity, and this has in it ratio of
infinite number.  And the chief consideration of natural science
is to consider the principles of natural things, which are three,
namely, matter, species, and form; in which this number is
visible, not only in all together, but, if we consider well, in
each one separately.  Therefore Pythagoras, according to
Aristotle in the first book of his Physics, gives the odd and
even as the principles of natural things, considering all things
to be number.  The other property of the Sun is also seen in
number, to which Arithmetic belongs, for the eye of the intellect
cannot behold it, for number considered in itself is infinite;
and this we cannot comprehend."

	In this Heaven of the Sun are seen the spirits of
theologians and Fathers of the Church; and its influences,
according to Albumasar, cited by Buti, are as follows: "The Sun
signifies the vital soul, light and splendor, reason and
intellect, science and the measure of life; it signifies kings,
princes and leaders, nobles and magnates and congregations of
men, strength and victory, voluptuousness, beauty and grandeur,
subtleness of mind, pride and praise, good desire of kingdom and
of subjects, and great love of gold, and affluence of speech, and
delight in neatness and beauty.  It signifies faith and the
worship of God, judges and wise men, fathers and brothers and
mediators; it joins itself to men and mingles among them, it
gives what is asked for, and is strong in vengeance, that is to
say, it punishes rebels and malefactors."

     The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,

     Oblique the centric globe: some say, the sun
     Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
     Like-distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
     Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,
     Up to the tropic Crab: thence down amain
     By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,
     As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change
     Of seasons to each clime: else had the spring
     Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,
     Equal in days and nights, except to those
     Beyond the polar circles; to them day
     Had unbenighted shone; while the low sun,
     To recompense his distance, in their sight
     Had rounded still the horizon, and not known
     Or east or west; which had forbid the snow
     From cold Estotiland, and south as far

	|98.~  Albertus Magnus, at whose twenty-one ponderous
folios one gazes with awe and amazement, was born of a noble
Swabian family at the beginning of the thirteenth century.  In
his youth he studied at Paris and at Padua; became a Dominican
monk, and, retiring to a convent in Cologne, taught in the schools
of that city.  He became Provincial of his Order in Germany; and
was afterward made Grand-Master of the Palace at Rome, and then
Bishop of Ratisbon.  Resigning his bishopric in 1262, he returned
to his convent in Cologne, where he died in 1280, leaving behind
him great fame for his learning and his labor.

	Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VIII.  259, says of him:
"Albert the Great at once awed by his immense erudition and
appalled his age.  His name, the Universal Doctor, was the homage
to his all-embracing knowledge.  He quotes, as equally familiar,
Latin, Greek, Arabic, Jewish philosophers.  He was the first
Schoolman who lectured on Aristotle himself, on Aristotle from
Graeco-Latin or Arabo-Latin copies.  The whole range of the
Stagirite's physical and metaphysical philosophy was within the
scope of Albert's teaching.  In later days he was called the Ape
of Aristotle; he had dared to introduce Aristotle into the
Sanctuary itself.  One of his Treatises is a refutation of the
Arabian Averrhoes.  Nor is it Aristotle and Averrhoes alone that
come within the pale of Albert's erudition; the commentators and
glossators of Aristotle, the whole circle of the Arabians, are
quoted; their opinions, their reasonings, even their words, with
the utmost familiarity.  But with Albert Theology was still the
master-science.  The Bishop of Ratisbon was of unimpeached
orthodoxy; the vulgar only, in his wonderful knowledge of the
secrets of Nature, in his studies of Natural History, could not
but see something of the magician.  Albert had the ambition of
reconciling Plato and Aristotle, and of reconciling this
harmonized Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy with Christian
Divinity.  He thus, in some degree, misrepresented or
misconceived both the Greeks; he hardened Plato into
Aristotelism, expanded Aristotelism into Platonism; and his
Christianity, though Albert was a devout man, while it constantly
subordinates, in strong and fervent language, knowledge to faith
and love, became less a religion than a philosophy."

	|99.~  Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor of the Schools.
Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VII. 265, gives the following
sketch of him: --

     "Of all the schoolmen Thomas Aquinas has left the greatest
     name.  He was a son of the Count of Aquino, a rich fief in
     the kingdom of Naples.  His mother, Theodora, was of the
     line of the old Norman kings; his brothers, Reginald and
     Landolph, held high rank in the Imperial armies.  His family
     was connected by marriage with the Hohenstaufens; they had
     Swabian blood in their veins, and so the great schoolman
     was of the race of Frederick II.  Monasticism seized on
     Thomas in his early youth; he became an inmate of Monte
     Casino; at sixteen years of age he caught the more fiery and
     vigorous enthusiasm of the Dominicans.  By them he was sent
     -- no unwilling proselyte and pupil -- to France.  He was
     seized by his worldly brothers, and sent back to Naples; he
     was imprisoned in one of the family castles, but resisted
     even the fond entreaties of his mother and his sisters.  He
     persisted in his pious disobedience, his holy hardness of
     heart; he was released after two years' imprisonment -- it
     might seem strange -- at the command of the Emperor
     Frederick II.  The godless Emperor, as he was called, gave
     Thomas to the Church.  Aquinas took the irrevocable vow of a
     Friar Preacher.  He became a scholar of Albert the Great at
     Cologne and at Paris.  He was dark, silent, unapproachable
     even by his brethren, perpetually wrapt in profound
     meditation.  He was called, in mockery, the great dumb ox of
     Sicily.  Albert questioned the mute disciple on the most
     deep and knotty points of theology; he found, as he
     confessed, his equal, his superior.  `That dumb ox will make
     the world resound with his doctrines.'  With Albert the
     faithful disciple returned to Cologne.  Again he went back
     to Paris, received his academic degree, and taught with
     universal wonder.  Under Alexander IV. he stood up in Rome
     in defence of his Order against the eloquent William de St.
     Amour; he repudiated for his Order, and condemned by his
     authority, the prophesies of the Abbot Joachim.  He taught
     at Cologne with Albert the Great; also at Paris, at Rome at
     Orvieto, at Viterbo, at Perugia.  Where he taught, the world
     listened in respectful silence.  He was acknowledged by two
     Popes, Urban IV.  and Clement IV., as the first theologian
     of the age.  He refused the Archbishopric of Naples.  He was
     expected at the Council of Lyons, as the authority before
     whom all Christendom might be expected to bow down.  He died
     ere he had passed the borders of Naples, at the Abbey of
     Rossa Nuova, near Terracina, at the age of forty-eight.
     Dark tales were told of his death; only the wickedness of
     man could deprive the world so early of such a wonder.  The
     University of Paris claimed, but in vain, the treasure of
     his mortal remains.  He was canonized by John XXII.

     "Thomas Aquinas is throughout, above all, the Theologian.
     God and the soul of man are the only objects truly worthy of his
     philosophic investigation.  This is the function of the Angelic
     Doctor, the mission of the Angel of the Schools.  In his works,
     or rather in his one great work, is the final result of all which
     has been decided by Pope or Council, taught by the Fathers,
     accepted by tradition, argued in the schools, inculcated in the
     confessional.  The Sun of Theology is the authentic,
     authoritative, acknowledged code of Latin Christianity.  We
     cannot but contrast this vast work with the original Gospel: to
     this bulk has grown the New Testament, or rather the doctrinal
     and moral part of the New Testament.  But Aquinas is an
     intellectual theologian: he approaches more nearly than most
     philosophers, certainly than most divines, to pure embodied
     intellect.  He is perfectly passionless; he has no polemic
     indignation, nothing of the Churchman's jealousy and suspicion;
     he has no fear of the result of any investigation; he hates
     nothing, hardly heresy; loves nothing, unless perhaps naked,
     abstract truth.  In his serene confidence that all must end in
     good, he moves the most startling and even perilous questions, as
     if they were the most indifferent, the very Being of God.  God
     must be revealed by syllogistic process.  Himself inwardly
     conscious of the absolute harmony of his own intellectual and
     moral being, he places sin not so much in the will as in the
     understanding.  The perfection of man is the perfection of his
     intelligence.  He examines with the same perfect self-command, it
     might almost be said apathy, the converse as well as the proof of
     the most vital religious truths.  He is nearly as consummate a
     sceptic, almost atheist, as he is a divine and theologian.
     Secure, as it should seem, in impenetrable armor, he has not only
     no apprehension, but seems not to suppose the possibility of
     danger; he has nothing of the boastfulness of self-confidence,
     but, in calm assurance of victory, gives every advantage to his
     adversary.  On both sides of every question he casts the argument
     into one of his clear, distinct syllogisms, and calmly places
     himself as Arbiter, and passes judgment in one or a series of
     still more unanswerable syllogisms.  He has assigned its
     unassailable province to Church authority, to tradition or the
     Fathers, faith and works; but beyond, within the proper sphere of
     philosopy, he asserts full freedom.  There is no Father, even St.
     Augustine, who may not be examined by the fearless intellect."

	|104.~  Gratian was a Franciscan friar, and teacher in the
school of the convent of St. Felix in Bologna.  He wrote the
^Decretum Gratiani~, or "Concord of the Discordant Canons," in
which he brought into agreement the laws of the courts secular
and ecclesiastical.

	|107.~  Peter Lombard, the "Master of Sentences," so
called from his ^Libri Sententiarum.~  In the dedication of this
work to the Church he says that he wishes "to contribute, like
the poor widow, his mite to the treasury of the Lord."  The
following account of him and his doctrines is from Milman, ^Hist.
Latin Christ.~, VIII. 238: 

     "Peter the Lombard was born near Novara, the native place of
     Lanfranc and of Anselm.  He was Bishop of Paris in 1159.  His
     famous Book of the Sentences was intended to be, and became to a
     great extent, the Manual of the Schools.  Peter knew not, or
     disdainfully threw aside, the philosophical cultivation of his
     day.  He adhered rigidly to all which passed for Scripture, and
     was the authorized interpretation of the Scripture, to all which
     had become the creed in the traditions, and law in the decretals,
     of the Church.  He seems to have no apprehension of doubt in his
     stern dogmatism; he will not recognize any of the difficulties
     suggested by philosophy; he cannot, or will not, perceive the weak
     points of his own system.  He has the great merit that, opposed as
     he was to the prevailing Platonism, throughout the Sentences the
     ethical principle predominates; his excellence is perspicuity,
     simpilicity, definiteness of moral purpose.  His distinctons are
     endless, subtile, idle; but he wrote from conflicting authorities
     to reconcile writers at war with each other, at war with
     themselves.  Their quarrels had been wrought to intentional or
     unintentional antagonism in the `Sic et Non'of Ab@elard.  That
     philosopher, whether Pyrrhonist or more than Pyrrhonist, had left
     them all in the confusion of strife; he had set Fathers against
     Fathers, each Father against himself, the Church against the
     Church, tradition against tradition, law against law.  The Lombard
     announced himself and was accepted as the mediator, the final
     arbiter in this endless litigation; he would sternly fix the
     positive, proscribe the negative or sceptical view in all these
     question.  The litigation might still go on, but within the limits
     which he had rigidly established; he had determined those ultimate
     results against which there was no appeal.  The mode of proof
     might be interminably contested in the schools; the conclusion was
     already irrefragably fixed.  On the sacramental system Peter the
     Lombard is loftily, severely hierarchical.  Yet he is moderate on
     the power of the keys; he holds only a declaratory power of
     binding the loosing, -- of showing how the souls of men were to be
     bound and loosed."

	Peter Lombard was born at the beginning of the twelfth
century, when the Novarese territory, his birthplace, was a part
of Lombardy, and hence his name.  He studied at the University of
Paris, under Abelard; was afterwards made Professor of Theology
in the University, and then Bishop of Paris.  He died in 1164.

	|109.~  Solomon, whose Song of Songs breathes such
impassioned love.

	|111.~  To know if he were saved or not, a grave question
having been raised upon that point by theologians.

	|115.~  Dionysius the Areopagite, who was converted by St.
Paul.  ^Acts~ xvii. 34: "Howbeit, certain men clave unto him, and
believed; among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite."  A book
attributed to him, on the "Celestial Hierarchy," was translated into
Latin by Johannes Erigena, and became in the Middle Ages the text-book
of angelic love.  "The author of those extaordinary treatises," says
Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VIII. 189, "which, from their obscure
and doubtful parentage, now perhaps hardly maintain their fame for
imaginative richness, for the occasional beauty of their language, and
their deep piety, -- those treatises which, widely popular in the West,
almost created the angel-worship of the popular creed, and were also
the parents of Mystic Theology and of the higher Scholasticism, -- this
Poet-Theologian was a Greek.  The writings which bear the venerable
name of Dionysius the Areopagite, the proselyte of St. Paul, first
appear under a suspicious and suspected form, as authorities cited by
the heterodox Severians in a conference at Constantinople.  The
orthodox stood aghast: how was it that writings of the holy convert of
St. Paul had never been heard of before?  that Cyril of Alexandria,
that Athanasius himself, were ignorant of their existence?  But these
writings were in themselves of too great power, too captivating, too
congenial to the monastic mind, not to find bold defenders.  Bearing
this venerable name in their front, and leaving behind them, in the
East, if at first a doubtful, a growing faith in their authenticity,
they appeared in the West as a precious gift from the Byzantine Emperor
to the Emperor Louis the Pious.  France in that age was not likely to
throw cold and jealous doubts on writings which bore the hallowed name
of that great Saint, whom she had already boasted to have left his
primal Bishopric of Athens to convert her forefathers, whom Paris
already held to be her tutelar patron, the rich and powerful Abbey of
St. Denys to be her founder.  There was living in the West, by happy
coincidence, the one man who at that period, by his knowledge of Greek,
by the congenial speculativeness of his mind, by the vigor and richness
of his imagination, was qualified to translate into Latin the
mysterious doctrines of the Areopagite, both as to the angelic world
and the subtile theology.  John Erigena hastened to make known in the
West the `Celestial Hierarchy,' the treatise `on the Name of God,' and
the brief chapters on the `Mystic Philisophy,'"

	|119.~  Paul Orosius.  He was a Spanish presbyster, born at
Tarragona near the close of the fourth century.  In his youth he
visited St. Augustine in Africa, who in one of his books describes him
thus: "There came to me a young monk, in the catholic peace our
brother, in age our son, in honor our fellow-presbyter, Orosius, alert
in intellect, ready of speech, eager in study, desiring to be a useful
vessel in the house of the Lord for the refutation of false and
pernicious doctrines, which have slain the souls of the Spaniards much
more unhappily than the sword of the barbarians their bodies."

	On leaving St. Augustine, he went to Palestine to
complete his studies under St. Jerome at Bethlehem, and while
there arraigned Pelagius for heresy before the Bishop of
Jerusalem.  The work by which he is chiefly known is his "Seven
Books of Histories"; a world-chronicle from the creation to his
own time.  Of this work St. Augustine availed himself in writing
his "City of God"; and it had also the honor of being translated
into Anglo-Saxon by King Alfred.  Dante calls Orosius "the
advocate of the Christian centuries," because this work was
written to refute the misbelievers who asserted that Christianity
had done more harm to the world than good.

	|125.~  Severinus Boethius, the Roman Senator and
philosopher in the days of Theodoric the Goth, born in 475, and
put to death in 524.  His portrait is thus drawn by Gibbon,
^Decline and Fall~, Ch. XXXIX.: "The Senator Boethius is the last
of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for
their countryman.  As a wealthy orphan, he inherited the patrimony
and honors of the Anician family, a name ambitiously assumed by
the kings and emperors of the age; and the appellation of Manlius
asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a race of consuls
and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the Capitol, and
sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic.  In the
youth of Boethius, the studies of Rome were not totally
abandoned; a Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a
consul; and the professors of grammar, rhetoric, and
jurisprudence were maintained in their privileges and pensions by
the liberality of the Goths.  But the erudition of the Latin
language was insufficient to satiate his ardent curiosity; and
Bo,ethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious years in
the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the
learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples.  The
reason and piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from
the contagion of mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of
the Academy; but he imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method
of his dead and living masters, who attempted to reconcile the
strong and subtle sense of Aristotle with the devout
contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.  After his return to
Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his friend, the
patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued in a palace of
ivory and marble to prosecute the same studies.  The Church was
edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the
Arian, the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the
Catholic unity was explained or exposed in a formal treaties by
the ^indifference~ of three distinct, though consubstantial
persons.  For the benefit of his Latin readers, his genius
submitted to teach the first elements of the arts and sciences of
Greece.  The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras, the
arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the
astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of
Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and
illustrated by the indefatigable pen of the Roman Senator.  And
he alone was esteemed capable of describing the wonders of art, a
sun-dial, a water-clock, or a sphere which represented the
motions of the planets.  From these abstruse speculations
Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he rose to the social
duties of public and private life: the indigent were relieved by
his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might compare
to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in
the cause of innocence and humanity.  Such conspicuous merit was
felt and rewarded by a discerning prince; the dignity of Boethius
was adorned with the titles of Consul and Patrician, and his
talents were usefully employed in the important station of Master
of the Offices."

	Being suspected of some participation in a plot against
Theodoric, he was confined in the tower of Pavia, where he wrote
the work which has immortalized his name.  Of this Gibbon speaks
as follows: "While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected
each moment the sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in
the tower of Pavia the ^Consolation of Philosophy~; a golden
volume not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which
claims incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the
situation of the author.  The celestial guide whom he had so long
invoked at Rome and Athens now condescended to illumine his
dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her
salutary balm.  She taught him to compare his long prosperity and
his recent distress, and to conceive new hope from the
inconstancy of fortune.  Reason had informed him of the
precarious condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him
of their real value; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might
resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent
malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had
left him virtue.  From the earth Boethius ascended to heaven in
search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical labyrinth
of chance and destiny, of prescience and free-will, of time and
eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect
attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral
and physical government.  Such topics of consolation, so obvious,
so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings
of human nature.  Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by
the labor of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine, in
the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and
eloquence, must already have possessed the intrepid calmness
which he affected to seek.  Suspense, the worst of evils, was at
length determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and
perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric.  A strong
cord was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly
tightened, till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and
some mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him
with clubs till he expired.  But his genius survived to diffuse a
ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the
writings, of the philospher were translated by the most glorious
of the English kings, and the third Emperor of the name of Otho
removed to a more honorable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,
who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honors of
martyrdom, and the fame of miracles."

	|128.~  Boethius was buried in the church of San Pietro di
Cieldauro in Pavia.

	|131.~  St. Isidore, a learned prelate of Spain, was born
in Cartagena, date unknown.  In 600 he became Bishop of Seville,
and died 636.  He was indefatigable in converting the Visigoths
from Arianism, wrote many theological and scientific works, and
finished the Mosarabic missal and breviary, begun by his brother
and predecessor St. Leander.

	"The Venerable Bede," or Beda, an Anglo-Saxon monk, was born at
Wearmouth in 672, and 735 died and was buried in the monastery of
Yarrow, where he had been educated and had passed his life.  His bones
were afterward removed to the Cathedral of Durham, and placed in the
same coffin with those of St.  Cuthbert.  He was the author of more
than forty volumes; among which his ^Ecclesiastical History of England~
is the most known and valued, and, like the ^Histories~ of Orosius, had
the honor of being translated by King Alfred from the Latin into Anglo-
Saxon. On his death-bed he dictated the close of his translation of the
Gospel of John.  "Dearest master," said his scribe, "one chapter still
remains, but it is difficult for thee to speak."  The dying monk
replied, "Take thy pen and write quickly."  Later the scribe said, "Only
one sentence remains"; and the monk said again, "Write quickly."  And
writing, the scribe said, "It is done."  "Thou hast said rightly,"
answered Bede, "it is done"; and died, repeating the ^Gloria Patri~,
closing the service of his long life with the closing words of the
service of the Church.  The following legend of him is from Wright's
^Biog. Britan. Lit.~, I. 269: "The reputation of Bede increased
daily, and we find him spoken of by the title of Saint very soon after
his death.  Boniface in his epistles describes him as the lamp of the
Church.  Towards the ninth century he received the appellation of The
Venerable, which has ever since been attached to his name.  As a
specimen of the fables by which his biography was gradually obscured,
we may cite the legends invented to account for the origin of this
latter title.  According to one, the Anglo-Saxon scholar was on a visit
to Rome, and there saw a gate of iron, on which were inscribed the
letters P.P.P.S.S.S.R.R.R.F.F.F., which no one was able to
interpret.  Whilst Bede was attentively considering the inscription, a
Roman who was passing by said to him rudely, `What seest thou there,
English ox?' to which Bed replied, `I see your confusion'; and he
immedately explained the characters thus: ^Pater Patriae Perditus,
Sapientia Secum Sublata, Ruet Regnum Rom@ae, Ferro Flamma Fame.~  The
Romans were astonished at the acuteness of their English visitor, and
decreed that the title of Venerable should be thenceforth given to
him.  According to another story, Bede, having become blind in his old
age, was walking abroad with one of his disciples for a guide, when
they arrived at an open place where there was a large heap of stones;
and Bede's companion persuaded his master to preach to the people who,
as he pretended, were assembled there and waiting in great silence and
expectation.  Bede delivered a most eloquent and moving discourse, and
when he had uttered the concluding phrase, ^Per omnia soecula
soeculorum~, to the great admiration of his disciple, the stones, we
are told, cried out aloud, 'Amen, Venerabilis Beda!' There is also a
third legend on this subject which informs us that, soon after Bede's
death, one of his disciples was appointed to compose an epitaph in
Latin Leonines, and carve it on his monument, and he began thus,

     `Hac sunt in fossa Bedae        ossa,' 

intending to introduce the word ^sancti~ or ^presbyteri~; but as
neither of these words would suit the metre, whilst he was puzzling
himself to find one more convenient, he fell asleep.  On awaking he
prepared to resume his work, when to his great astonishment he found
that the line had already been completed on the stone (by an angel, as
he supposed), and that it stood thus:

     `Hac sunt in fossa Bedae Venerabilis ossa.'"

	Richard of St. Victor was a monk in the monastery of
that name near Paris, "and wrote a book on the Trinity," says the
^Ottimo~, "and many other beautiful and sublime works"; praise
which seems justified by Dante's words, if not suggested by them.
Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VIII. 241, says of him and his
brother Hugo: "Richard de St. Victor was at once more logical
and more devout, raising higher at once the unassisted power of
man, yet with even more supernatural interference, -- less
ecclesiastical, more religious.  Thus the silent, solemn cloister
was, as it were, constantly balancing the noisy and pugnacious
school.  The system of the St. Victors is the contemplative
philosophy of deep-thinking minds in their profound seclusion,
not of intellectual gladiators: it is that of men following out
the train of their own thoughts, not perpetually crossed by the
objections of subtle rival disputants.  Its end is not victory,
but the inward satisfaction of the soul.  It is not so much
conscious of ecclesiastical restraint, it is rather self-
restrained by its inborn reverence; it has no doubt, therefore no
fear; it is bold from the inward consciousness of its orthodoxy."

	|135.~  As to many other life-weary men, like those
mentioned in ^Purg.~ XVI. 122: --

                      "And late they deem it
     That God restore them to the better life."

	|136.~  "This is Master Sigier," says the ^Ottimo~ "who
wrote and lectured on Logic in Paris."  Very little more is known
of him than this, and that he was supposed to hold some odious,
if not heretical opinions.  Even his name has perished out of
literary history, and survives only in the verse of Dante and the
notes of his commentators.

	|137.~  The Rue du Fouarre, or Street of Straw, originally
called Rue de l'@Ecole, is famous among the old streets of Paris,
as having been the cradle of the University.  It was in early
times a hay and straw market, and hence derives its name.  In the
old poem of ^Les Rues de Paris~, Barbazan, II. 247, are these
lines: --

     "Enpr@es est rue de l'@Ecole,
     La demeure Dame Nicole;
     En celle rue, ce me samble,
     Vent-on et fain et fuerre ensamble."

Others derive the name from the fact, that the students covered
the benches of their lecture-rooms with straw, or used it instead
of benches; which they would not have done if a straw-market had
not been near at hand.

	Dante, moved perhaps by some pleasant memory of the past,
pays the old scholastic street the tribute of a verse.  The
elegant Petrarca mentions it frequently in his Latin writings,
and always with a sneer.  He remembers only "the disputatious
city of Paris, and the noisy Street of Staw"; or "the plaudits of
the Petit Pont and the Rue de Fouarre, the most famous places on
earth."

	Rabelais speaks of it as the place where Pantagruel first
held disputes with the learned doctors, "having posted up his
nine thousand seven hundred and sixty-four theses in all the
carrefours of the city"; and Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 85,
justifies the mention of it in Paradise as follows: --

     "A common idealist would have been rather alarmed at the
     thought of introducing the name of a street in Paris -- Straw
     Street (Rue de Fouarre) -- into the midst of a description of the
     highest heavens....  What did it matter to Dante, up in heaven
     there, whether the mob below thought him vulgar or nor!  Sigier
     ^had~ read in Straw Street; that was the fact, and he had to say
     so, and there an end.
     
     "There is, indeed, perhaps, no greater sign of innate and
     ^real~ vulgarity of mind or defective education, than the want of
     power to understand the universality of the ideal truth; the
     absence of sympathy with the colossal grasp of those intellects,
     which have in them so much of divine, that nothing is small to
     them, and nothing large; but with equal and unoffended vision
     they take in the sum of the world, Straw Street and the seventh
     heavens, in the same instant.  A certain portion of this divine
     spirit is visible even in the lower examples of all the true men;
     it is, indeed, perhaps the clearest test of their belonging to
     the true and great group, that they are continually touching what
     to the multitude appear vulgarities.  The higher a man stands,
     the more the word `vulgar' becomes unintelligible to him."

	The following sketch from the note-book of a recent
traveller shows the Street of Straw in its present condition: "I
went yesterday in search of the Rue du Fouarre.  I had been
hearing William Guizot's lecture on Montaigne, and from the
Coll$ege de France went down the Rue St. Jacques, passing at the
back of the old church of St. Severin, whose gargoyles still
stretch out their long necks over the street.  Turning into the
Rue Galande, a few steps brought me to Fouarre.  It is a short
and narrow street, with a scanty footway on one side, on the
other only a gutter.  The opening at the farther end is filled by
a picturesque vista of the transept gable and great rose-window of
Notre Dame, over the river, with the slender central spire.  Some
of the houses on eiter side of the street were evidently of a
compartively modern date; but others were of the oldest, and the
sculptured stone wreaths over the doorways, and the remains of
artistic iron-work in the balconies, showed them to have been
once of some consideration.  Some dirty children were playing at
the door of a shop where fagots and ^charbon de terre de Paris~
were sold.  A coachman in glazed hat sat asleep on his box before
the shop of a ^blanchisseuse de fin.~  A woman in a bookbinder's
window was folding the sheets of a French grammar.  In an angle
of the houses under the high wall of the hospital garden was a
cobbler's stall.  A stout, red-faced woman, standing before it,
seeing me gazing round, asked if Monsieur was seeking anything in
special.  I said I was only looking at the old street; it must be
very old. `Yes, one of the oldest in Paris.'  `And why is called
"du Fouarre"?'  `O, that is the old French for ^foin~; and hay
used to be sold here.  Then, there were famous schools here in
the old days; Abelard used to lecture here.'  I was delighted to
find the traditions of the place still surviving, though I cannot
say whether she was right about Abelard, whose name may have
become merely typical; it is not improbable, however, that he may
have made and annihilated many a man of straw, after the fashion
of the doctors of dialectics, in the Fouarre.  His house was not far
off on the Quai Napol@eon in the Cit@e; and that of the Canon Fulbert
on the corner of the Rue Basse de Ursins.  Passing through to the Pont
au Double, I stopped to look at the books on the parapet, and found a
voluminous Dictionnaire Historique, but, oddly enough, it contained
neither Sigier's name, nor Abelard's.  I asked a ruddy-cheeked boy on a
doorstep if he went to school.  He said he worked in the day-time, and
went to an evening school in the Rue du Fouarre, No. 5.  That primary
night school seems to be the last feeble descendant of the ancient
learning.  As to straw, I saw none except a kind of rude straw matting
placed round the corner of a wine-shop at the entrance of the street; a
sign that oysters are sold within, they being brought to Paris in this
kind of matting."

	|138.~  Buti interprets thus: "Lecturing on the Elenchi of
Aristotle, to prove some truths he formed certain syllogisms so
well and artfully, as to excite envy."  Others interpret the word
|invidiosi~ in the Latin sense of odious, -- truths that were
odious to somebody; which interpretation is supported by the fact
that Sigier was summoned before the primate of the Dominicans on
suspicion of heresy, but not convicted.

	|147.~  Milton, ^At a Solemn Musick~:--

         "Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heaven's joy;
       Sphere-born harmonious sisters, Voice and Verse;
       Wed your divine sounds, and mixed power employ
       Dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce;
       And to our high-raised fantasy present
       That undisturbed song of pure concent,
       Aye sung before the sapphire-colored throne
       To Him that sits thereon,
       With saintly shout, and solemn jubilee;
       Where the bright Seraphim, in burning row,
       Their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow;
       And the cherubic host, in thousand quires,
       Touch their immortal harps of golden wires,
       With those just spirits that wear victorious palms
       Hymns devout and holy psalms
       Singing everlastingly:
       That we on earth, with undiscording voice,
       May rightly answer that melodious noise;
       As once we did, till disproportioned sin
       Jarred against Nature's chime, and with harsh din
       Broke the fair music that all creatures made
       To their great Lord, whose love their motion swayed
       In perfect diapason, whilst they stood
       In first obedience, and their state of good.
       O, may we soon again renew that song,
       And keep in tune with Heaven, till God erelong
       To his celestial concert us unite,
       To live with him, and sing in endless morn of light!"
