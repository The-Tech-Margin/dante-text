	|1.~  The Heaven of Mars continued.

	|22.~  This star, or spirit, did not, in changing place,
pass out of the cross, but along the right arm and down the trunk
or body of it.

	|24.~  A light in a vase of alabaster.

	|25.~  ^AEneid~, VI., Davidson's Tr.:

     "But father Anchises, deep in a verdant dale, was surveying with
     studious care the souls there enclosed, who were to revisit the
     light above; and happened to be reviewing the whole number of his
     race, his dear descendants, their fates and fortunes, their
     manners and achievements.  As soon as he beheld AEneas advancing
     toward him across the meads, he joyfully stretched out both his
     hands, and tears poured down his cheeks, and these words dropped
     from his mouth: Are you come at length, and has that piety
     experienced by your sire, surmounted the ardous journey?"

	|28.~  Biagioli and Fraticelli think that this ancestor of
Dante, Cacciaguida, who is speaking, makes use of the Latin
language because it was the language of his day in Italy.  It
certainly gives to the passage a certain gravity and tinge of
antiquity, which is in keeping with this antique spirit and with
what he afterwards says.  His words may be thus translated: --

     "O blood of mine!  O grace of God infused
        Superlative!  To whom as unto thee
        Were ever twice the gates of heaven un-closed."

	|49.~  His longing to see Dante.  

	|50.~  The mighty volume of the Divine Mind, in which the dark
or written parts are not changed by erasures, nor the white spaces by
interlineations.  

	|56.~  The Pythagorean doctrine of numbers.  Ritter,
^Hist. Anc. Phil., Morrison's Tr., I. 361, says: --

     "In the Pythagorean doctrine, number comprises within two
     species, -- odd and even; it is therefore the unity of these
     two contraries; it is the odd and the even.  Now the
     Pythagoreans said also that one, or the unit, is the odd and
     the even; and thus we arrive as this result, that one, or
     the unit, is the essence of number, or number absolutely.
     As such, it is also the ground of all numbers, and is
     therefore named the first one, of whose origin nothing
     further can be said.  In this respect the Pythagorean of
     numbers is merely an expression for `all is from the
     original one', -- from one being, to which they also gave
     the name of God; for in the words of Philolaus, `God
     embraces and actuates all, and is but one'.....

     "But in the essence of number, or in the first original,
     all other numbers, and consequently the elements of numbers, and
     the elements of the whole world, and all nature, are contained.
     The elements of number are the even and the odd; on this account
     the first one is the even-odd, which the Pythagoreans, is their
     occasionally strained mode of symbolizing, attempted to prove
     thus; that one being added to the even makes odd, and to the odd,
     even".

	Cowley, ^Rural Solitude~:, --

     "Before the branchy head of Number's tree
      Sprang from the trunk of one".

	|61.~  All the spirits of Paradise look upon God, and see
in him as in a mirror even the thoughts of men.

	|74.~  The first Equality is God, all whose attributes are
equal and eternal; and living in Him, the love and knowledge of
spirits are also equal.

	|79.~  Will and power.  Dante would fain thank the spirit
that had addressed him, but knows not how.  He has the will, but
not the power.  Dante uses the word argument in the sense of
power, or means, or appliance, ^Purg.~ II. 31: --

     "See how he scorns all human arguments,
        So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail
        Than his own wings, between so distant shores".

	|85.~  Dante calls the spirit of Cacciaguida a living
topaz set in the celestial cross, probably from the brillancy and
golden light of this precious stone.  He may also have had in his
mind the many wonderful qualities, as well as the beauty, of the
gem.  He makes use of the same epithet in Canto XXX. 76.

	The ^Ottimo~ says, that he who wears the topaz cannot be
injured by an enemy; and Mr. King, ^Antique Gems~, p. 427, says:
"If thrown into boiling water, the water cools immediately; hence
this gem cools lust, calms madness and attacks of frenzy."  In
the same work he gives a translation of the ^Lapidarium~ of
Marbodus, or Marboeuf, Bishop of Rennes in 1081.  Of the
chrysolite, which is supposed to be the same as the topaz, this
author says: --

     "The golden ^Chrysolite~ a fiery blaze
      Mixed with the hue of ocean's green displays;
      Enchased in gold, its strong protective might
      Drives far away the terrors of the night;
      Strung on a hair plucked from as ass's tail,
      The mightiest demons 'neath its influence quail."

	|89.~  He had been waiting for the coming of Dante, with
the "hunger long and grateful" spoken of in line 49.

	|91.~  The first of the family who bore the name of
Alighieri, still punished in the circle of Pride in Purgatory,
and needing the prayers and good offices of Dante to set him
free.

	|97.~  Barlow, ^Study of Div. Com.~, p 441, says: --

     "The name of Florence has been variously explained.  With
     the old chroniclers the prevalent opinion was, that it was
     derived from ^Fiorino~, the Praetor of Metullus, who during the
     long siege of Fiesole by the Romans commanded an intrenched camp
     between the River and the Rock, and was here surprised and slain
     by the enemy.  The meadows abounded in flowers, especially
     lilies, and an ancient ensign, a white lily on a red ground,
     subsequently reversed (XVI. 154), and similar to the form on the
     florin (^fiorino~), with the name given to the Duomo, St. Maria
     del Fiore, tend to show that the name was taken from the flowery
     mead, rather than from the name of a Roman praetor.  Leonardo
     Aretino stares that the name of the city originally was
     ^Fluentia~, so called because situated between the Arno and the
     Mugnone: and that subsequently, from the flourishing state of the
     colony, it was called ^Florentia.~  Scipione Ammirato affirms
     that its name from the first was ^Florenzia.~

	"The form and dimensions of the original city have not
     been very accurately recorded.  In shape, probably, it resembled
     a Roman camp.  Malespini says that it was `quasi a similitudine
     di bastie.'  The wall was of burnt bricks, with solid round
     towers at intervals of twenty cubits, and it had four gates, and
     six posterns.  The Campidoglio, where now is the Mercato Vecchio,
     was an imitation of that of the parent city, Rome, whose fortunes
     her daughter for many centuries shared.....

	"The |cerchia antica~ of Cacciaguida was the first circle
     of the new city, which arose from the ruins of the Roman one
     destroyed by Totila; it included the Badia, which the former did
     not; Dante, therefore, in mentioning this circumstance, shows how
     accurately he had informed himself of the course of the previous
     wall.  The walls of Dante's time were begun in 1284, but not
     finished until nine years after his death; they are those of the
     present day."

	|98.~  Tierce, or |Terza~, is the first division of the
canonical day, from six to nine; Nones; of |Nuna~, the third from
twelve to three in the afternoon.  See ^Inf.~ XXXIV.  Note 95.
The bells of the Abbey within the old walls of Florence still
rang these hours in Dante's time, and measured the day of the
Florentines, like the bells of morning, noon, and night in our
New England towns.  In the ^Convito~, IV. 23, Dante says: "The
service of the first part of the day, that is, of Tierce, is said
at the end of it; and that of the third and fourth, at the
beginning.....  And therefore be it known unto all, that properly
Nones should always ring at the beginning of the seventh hour of
the day".  

	|99.~  Napier, ^Florent. Hist.~, I. 572, writes as
follows: "The simplicity of Florentine manners in 1260, described
by Villani and Malespini, justifies a similar picture as drawn by
their great poet. `Then', say these writers, `the Florentines
lived soberly on the simplest food at little expense; many of
their customs were rough and rude, and both men and women went
coarsely clad; many even wearing plain leather garments without
fur or lining: they wore boots on their feet and caps on their
head: the women used un-ornamented buskins, and even the most
distinguished were content with a close gown of scarlet serge or
camlet, confined by a leathern waist-belt of the ancient fashion,
and a hooded cloak lined with miniver; and the poorer classes
wore a coarse green cloth dress of the same form.  A hundred lire
was the common dowry of a girl, and two and three hundred were
then considered splendid fortunes: most young women waited until
they were twenty years old and upwards before they married.  And
such was the dress, and such the manners and simple habits of the
Florentines of that day; but loyal in heart, faithful to each
other, zealous and honest in the execution of public duties; and
with their coarse and homely mode of life they gained more virtue
and honor for themselves and their country than they who
now live so delicately are able to accomplish.'"

	What Florence had become in Dante's time may be seen from
the following extract from Frate Francesco Pippino, who wrote in
1313, and whose account is thus given by Napier, II. 542: "Now
indeed, in the present luxurious age, many shameful practices are
introduced instead of the former customs; many indeed to the
injury of people's minds, because frugality is exchanged for
magnificence; the clothing being now remarkable for its exquisite
materials, workmanship, and superfluous of silver, gold, and
pearls; admirable fabrics; wide-spreading embroidery; silk for
vests, painted or variously colored, and lined with divers
precious furs from foreign countries.  Excitement to gluttony is
not wanting; foreign wines are much esteemed, and almost all the
people drink in public.  The viands are sumptuous; the chief
cooks are held in great honor; provocatives of the palate are
eagerly sought after; ostentation increases; money-makers exert
themselves to supply these tastes; hence usuries, frauds, rapine,
extortion, pillage, and contentions in the commonwealth: also
unlawful taxes: oppression of the innocent; banishment of
citizens, and the combinations of rich men.  Our true god is our
belly; we adhere to the pomps which were renounced at our
baptism, and thus desert to the great enemy of our race.  Well
indeed does Seneca, the instructor of morals, in his book of
orations, curse our times in the following words: `Daily, things
grow worse because the whole contest is for dishonorable matters.
Behold! the indolent senses of youth are numbed, nor are they
active in the pursuit of any one honest thing.  Sleep, languor,
and a carefulness for bad things, worse than sleep and languor,
have seized upon their minds; the love of singing, dancing, and
other unworthy occupations possesses them: they are effeminate:
to soften the hair, to lower the tone of their voice to female
compliments; to vie with women in effeminacy of person, and adorn
themselves with un-becoming delicacy, is the object of our
youth.'" 

	|100.~  Villani, ^Cronica~, VI. 69, as quoted in Note 99:
"The women used unornamented buskins, and even the most
distinguished were content with a close gown of scarlet serge or
camlet, confined by a leathern waist-belt of the ancient fashion,
and a hooded cloak lined with miniver; and the poorer classes
wore a coarse green cloth dress of the same form."

	|102.~  Dante, ^Convito~, I. 10: "Like the beauty of a
woman, when the ornaments of her apparel cause more admiration
than she herself."  

	|108.~  Eastern effeminacy in general; what
Boccaccio calls the ^morbidezze d'Egitto~.  Paul Orosius, "the
advocate of the Christian centuries", as quoted by the ^Ottimo~,
says: "The last king of Syria was Sardanapalus, a man more
corrupt than a woman, (^corrotto pi@u che femmina~,) who was seen
by his perfect Arabetes, among a herd of courtesans, clad in
female attire."

	|109.~  Montemalo, or Montemario, is the hill from
which the traveller coming from Viterbo first catches sight of
Rome.  The Ucellatojo is the hill from which the traveller coming
from Bologna first catches sight of Florence.  Here the two hills
are used to signify what is seen from them; namely, the two
cities; and Dante means to say, that Florence had not yet
surpassed Rome in the splendour of its buildings; but as Rome
would one day by surpassed by Florence in its rise, so would it
be in its downfall.

	Speaking of the splendour of Florence in Dante's age,
Napier, ^Florent. Hist.~, II. 581, says: --

     "Florence was at this period well studded with handsome
     dwellings; the citizens were continually building,
     repairing, altering, and embellishing their houses; adding
     every day to their ease and comforts, and introducing
     improvements from foreign nations.  Sacred architecture of
     every kind partook of this taste; and there was no popular
     citizen or nobleman but either had built or was building
     fine country palaces and villas, far exceeding their city
     residence in size and magnificence; so that many were
     accounted crazy for their extravagance.

	"`And so magnificent was the sight', says Villani, `that
strangers unused to Florence, on coming from abroad, when they
beheld the vast assemblage of rich buildings and beautiful
palaces with which the country was so thickly studded for three
miles round the ramparts, believed that all was city like that
within the Roman walls, and this was independent of the rich
palaces, towers, courts, and walled gardens at a greater
distance, which in other countries would be denominated castles.
In short', he continues, `it is estimated that within a circuit
of six miles round the town there are rich and noble dwellings
enough to make two cities like Florence.'  And Ariosto seems to
have caught the same idea when he exclaims, --

     While gazing on thy villa-studded hills
     'T would seem as though the earth grew palaces
     As she is wont by nature to bring forth
     Young shoots, and leafy plants, and flowery shrubs:
     And if within one wall and single name
     Could be collected all thy scattered halls,
     Two Romes would scarcely form thy parallel.'"

	|110.~  The "which" in this line refers to Montemalo of
the preceding.

	|112.~  Bellincion Berti, whom Dante selects as a type of
the good citizen of Florence in the olden time, and whom Villani
calls "the best and most honored gentleman of Florence", was of
the noble family of the Ravignani.  He was the father of the
"good Gualdrada, whose story shines out so pleasantly in
Boccaccio's commentary.  See ^Inf.~ XVI.  Note 37.

	|115.~  "Two ancient houses of the city", says the ^Ottimo~;
"and he saw the chiefs of these houses were content with leathern
jerkins without any drapery; he who should dress so now-a-days
would be laughed at: and he saw their dames spinning, as who
should say, `Now-a-days not even the maid will spin, much less
the lady.'"  And Buti upon the same text: "They wore leathern
dresses without any cloth over them; they did not make to
themselves long robes, nor cloaks of scarlet lined with vaire, as
they do now."

	|120.~  They were not abandoned by their husbands, who,
content with little, did not go to traffic in France.

	|128.~  Monna Cianghella della Tosa was a gay widow of
Florence, who led such a life of pleasure that her name has
passed into a proverb, or a common name for a dissolute woman.

	Lapo Salterello was a Florentine lawyer, and a man of
dissipated habits; and Crescimbeni, whose mill grinds everything
that comes to it, count him among the poets, ^Volgar Poesia~,
III. 82, and calls him a ^Rimatore de non poco grido~, a rhymer
of no little renown.  Unluckily he quotes one of his sonnets.

	|129.~  Quinctius, surnamed Cincinnatus from his neglected
locks, taken from his plough and made Dictator by the Roman
Senate, and, after he had defeated the Volscians and saved the
city, returning to his plough again.

	Cornelia, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the
Gracchi, who preferred for her husband a Roman citizen to a
king, and boasted that her childred were her only jewels.

	Shakespeare, ^Tit. Andron.~, IV. 1: --

     "Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
      Read to her sons, than she hath read to thee
      Sweet poetry, and Tully's Orator."

	|133.~  The Virgin Mary, invoked in the pains of 
child-birth, as mentioned ^Purg.~ XX. 19: --

     "And I by peradventure heard `Sweet Mary!'
        Uttered in front of us amid the weeping.
        Even as a woman does who is in child-birth".

	|134.~  The Baptistery of the church of St. John in
Florence; ^il mio bel San Giovanni~, my beautiful St. John, as
Dante calls it, ^Inf.~ XIX. 17.

	|135.~  Of this ancestor of Dante Cacciaguida, nothing is
known but what the poet here tells us, and so clearly that it is
not necessary to repeat it in prose.

	|137.~  Cacciaguida's wife came from Ferrara in the Val di
Pado, or Val di Po, the Valley of the Po.  She was of the
Aldigheiri or Alighieri family, and from her Dante derived his
surname.

	|139.~  The Emperor Conrad III. of Swabia, uncle of
Frederic Barbarossa.  In 1143, he joined Louis VII. of France in
the Second Crusade, of which St. Bernard was the great preacher.
He died in 1152, after his return from this crusade.

	|140.~  Cacciaguida was knighted by the Emperor Conrad.

	|143.~  The law or religion of Mahomet.
