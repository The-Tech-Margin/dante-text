	|35.~  Speaking of Petrarch's visit to Rome, Mr. Norton,
^Travel and Study in Italy~, p. 288, says: "The great church of
St. John Lateran, 'the mother and head of all the churches of the
city and the world`, -- ^mater urbis et orbis~, -- had been
almost destroyed by fire, with its adjoining palace, and the
houses of the canons, on the Eve of St. John, in 1308.  The
palace and the canons' houses were rebuilt not long after; but at
the time of petrarch's latest visit to Rome, and for years
afterward, the church was without a roof, and its walls were
ruinous.  The poet addressed three at least of the Popes at
Avignon with urgent appeals that this disgrace should no longer
be permitted, -- but the Popes gave no heed to his words; for the
ruin of Roman churches, or of Rome itself, was a matter of little
concern to these Transalpine prelates."

	|102.~  St. Bernard, the great Abbot of Clairvaux, the
^Doctor Mellifluus~ of the Church, and preacher of the disastrous
Second Crusade, was born of noble parents in the village of
Fontaine near Dijon, in Burgundy, in the year 1190.  After
studying at Paris, at the age of twenty he entered the
Benedictine monastery of Citeaux; and when, five years later,
this monastery had become overcrowded with monks, he was sent out
to found a new one.

	Mrs. Jameson, ^Legends of the Monastic Orders~, p. 149,
says: "The manner of going forth on these occasions was
strikingly characteristic of the age; -- the abbot chose twelve
monks, representing the twelve Apostled, and placed at their head
a leader, representing Jesus Christ, who, with a cross in his
hand, went before them.  The gates of the convent opened, -- then
closed behind them, -- and they wandered into the wide world,
trusting in God to show them their destined abode.

	"Bernard led his followers to a wilderness, called the
^Valley of Wormwood~, and there, at his biding, arose the since
renowned abbey of Clairvaux.  They felled the trees, built
themselves huts, tilled and sowed the ground, and changed the
whole face of the country round; till that which had been a
dismal solitude, the resort of wolves and robbers, became a land
of vines and corn, rich, populous, and prosperous."

	This incident forms the subject of one of Murillo's most
famous paintings, and is suggestive of the saint's intense
devotion to the Virgin, which Dante expresses in this line.

	Mr. Vaughan, ^Hours with the Mystics~, I, 145, gives the
following sketch of St Bernard: --

	"With Bernard the monastic life is the one thing needful. 
He began life by drawing after him into the convent all his
kindred; sweeping them one by one from the high seas of the world
with the irresistible vortex of his own religious fervor.  His
incessant cry for Europe is, Better monasteries, and more of
them.  Let these ecclesiastical castles multiply; let them cover
and command the land, well garrisoned with men of God, and then,
despite all heresy and schism, theocracy will flourish, the earth
shall yield her increase, and all people praise the Lord.  Who so
wise as Bernard to win souls for Christ, that is to say, recruits
for the cloister?  With what eloquence he paints the raptures of
contemplation, the vanity and sin of earthly ambition or of
earthly love!  Whereve in his travels Bernard may have preached,
there, presently, exultant monks must open wide their doors to
admit new converts.  Wherever he goed, he bereaves mothers of
their children, the aged of their last solace and last support;
praising those the most who leave most misery behind them.  How
sternly does he rebuke those Rachels who mourn and will not be
comforted for children dead to them forever!  What vitriol does
he pour into the wounds when he asks if they will drag their son
down to perdition with themselves by resisting the vocation of
Heaven; whether it was not enough that they brought him forth
sinful to a world of sin, and will they now, in their insane
affection, cast him into the fires of hell?  Yet Bernard is not
hard-hearted by nature.  He can pity this disgraceful weakness of
the flesh.  He makes such amends as superstition may.  I will be
a father to him, he says. Alas! cold comfort.  You, their hearts
will answer, whose flocks are countless, would nothing content
you but our ewe lamb?  Perhaps some cloister will be, for them
too, the last resource of their desolation. They will fly for
ease in their pain to the system which caused it.  Bernard hopes
so.  So inhuman is the humanity of asceticism; cruel its tender
mercies; thus does it depopulate the world of its best in order
to improve it...

	"Bernard had his wish.  He made Clairvaux the cynosure of
all contemplative eyes.  For any one who could exist at all as a
monk, with any satisfaction to himself, that was the place above
all others.  Brother Godfrey, sent out to be first Abbot of
Fontenay, -- as soon as he has set all things in order there,
returns, only too gladly, from that rich and lovely region, to
re-enter his old cell, to walk around, delightedly revisiting the
well-rememberes spots among the trees or by the water-side,
marking how the fields and gardens have come on, and relating to
the eager brethern (for even Bernard's monks have curiosity) all
that befell him in his work.  He would sooner be third Prior at
Clairvaux, than Abbot of Fontenay.  So, too, with Brother
Humbert, commissioned in like manner to regulate Igny Abbey
(fourth daughter of Clairvaux).  He soon comes back, weary of the
labor and sick for home, to look on the Aube once more, to hear
the old mills go drumming and droning, with that monotony of
muffled sound -- the associate of his pious reveries -- often
heard in his dreams when far away; to set his feet on the very
same flagstone in the choir where he used to stand, and to be
happy.  But Bernard, though away in Italy, toiling in the matter
of the schism, gets to hear of his return, and finds time to send
him across the Alps a letter of rebuke for this criminal
self-pleasing, whose terrible sharpness must have darkened the
poor man's meditations for many a day.

	"Bernard had further the satisfaction of improving and
extending monasticism to the utmost; of sewing together, with
tolerable success, the rended vesture of the Papacy; of
suppressing a more popular and more Scriptural Christianity, for
the benefit of his despotic order; of quenching for a time, by
the extinction of Abelard, the spirit of free inquiry; and of
seeing his ascetic and superhuman ideal of religion everywhere
accepted as the genuine type of Christian virtue."

	|104.~  The Veronica is the portrait of our Saviour
impressed upon a veil or kerchief, preserved with great care in
the church of the Santi Apostoli at Rome.  Collin de Plancy,
^L$egendes des Saintes Images~, p. II, gives the following account
of it: --

	"Properly speaking, the Veronica (^vera icon~) is the
true likeness of Our Lord; and the same name has been given to
the holy woman who obtained it, because the name of this holy
woman was uncertain. According to some, she was a pious Jewess,
called Seraphia; according to others, she was Berenice, niece of
Herod.  It is impossible to decide between the different
traditions, some of which make her a virgin, and others the wife
of Zaccheus.

	"However this may be, the happy woman who obtained the
venerable imprint of the holy face lived not far from the palace
of Pilate.  Her house is still shown to pilgrims at Jerusalem;
and a Canon of Mayence, who went to the Holy Land in 1483,
reported that he had visited the house of the Veronica.

	"When she saw Our Lord pass, bearing his cross, covered
with blood, spittle, sweat, and dust, she ran to meet him, and,
presenting her kerchief, tried to wipe his adorable face.  Our
Lord, leaving for an instant the burden of the cross to Simon the
Cyrenean, took the kerchief, applied it to his face, and gave it
back to the pious woman, marked with the exact imprint of his
august countenance."

	Of the Veronica there are four copies in existence, each
claiming to be the original; one at Rome, another at Paris, a
third at Laon, and a fourth at Xaen in Andalusia.  The traveller
who has crossed the Sierra Morena cannot easily forget the stone
column, surmounted by an iron cross, which marks the boundary
between La Mancha and Andalusia, with the melancholy stone face
upon it, and the inscription, "^El verdadero Retrato de la Santa
Cara del Dios de Xaen.~"
