	|1.~  The Heaven of Saturn, where are seen the Spirits of
the Contemplative.

	"This planet", says Brunetto Latini, "is cruel,
felonious, and of a cold nature."  Dante, ^Convito~, II, 14,
makes it the symbol of Astrology."The Heaven of Saturn", he says,
"has two properties by which it may be compared to Astrology. 
The first is the slowness of its movement through the twelve
signs; for, according to the writings of Astrologers, its
revolution requires twenty-nine years and more.  The second is,
that it is the highest of all the planets.  And these two
properties are in Astrology; for in completing its circle, that
is, in learning it, a great space of time passes; both on account
of its demonstrations, which are more than in any of the
above-mentioned sciences, and on account of the experience which
is necessary to judge rightly in it.  And, moreover, it is the
highest of all; for, as Aristotle says at the beginning of his
treatise on the Soul, Science is of high nobility, from the
nobleness of its subject, and from its certainty; and this more
than any of the above-mentioned is noble and high, from its noble
and high subject, which is the movement of the heavens; and high
and noble from its certainty, which is without any defect, as one
that proceeds from a most perfect and regular source.  And if any
one thinks there is any defect in it, the defect is not on the
side of the Science, but, as Ptolemy says, it comes from our
negligence, and to that it should be attributed".

	Of the influences of Saturn, Buti, quoting Albumasar,
says: "The nature of Saturn is cold, dry, melancholy, sombre, of
grave asperity, and may be cold and moist, and of ugly color, and
is of much eating and of true love,...  And it signifies ships at
sea, and journeyings long and perilous, and malice, and envy, and
tricks, and seductions, and boldness in dangers,... and
singularity, and little companionship of men, and pride and
magnanimity, and simulation and boasting, and servitude of
rulers, and every deed done with force and malice, and injuries,
and anger, and strife, and bonds and imprisonment, truth in
words, delight, and beauty, and intellect; experiments and
diligence in cunning, and affluence of thought, and profoundness
of counsel...  And it signifies old and ponderous men, and
gravity and fear, lamentation and sadness, embarrassment of mind,
and fraud, and affliction, and destruction, and loss, and dead
men, and remains of the dead; weeping and orphanhood, and ancient
things, ancestors, uncles, elder brothers, servants and
muleteers, and men despised, and robbers, and those who dig
graves, and those who steal the garments of the dead, and
tanners, vituperators, magicians, and warriors, and vile men".

	|6.~  Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, who besought her
lover, Jupiter, to come to her, as he went to Juno, "in all the
pomp of his divinity."  Ovid, ^Met.~, III, Addison's Tr.: --

     "The mortal dame, too feeble to engage
     The lightning's flashes and the thunder's rage,
     Consumed amidst the glories she desired,
     And in the terrible embrace expired".

	|13.~  To the planet Saturn, which was now in the sign,
of the Lion, and sent down its influence warmed by the heat of
this constellation.

	|27.~  The peaceful reign of Saturn, in the Age of Gold.

	|29.~  "As in Mars", comments the ^Ottimo~, "he placed
the Cross for a stairway, to denote that through martyrdom the
spirits had ascended to God; and in Jupiter, the Eagle, as a sign
of the Empire; so here he places a golden stairway, to denote
that the ascent of these souls, which was by contemplation, is
more supreme and more lofty than any other".

	|35.~  Shakespeare, ^Macbeth~, III, 2: --

                        "The crow
     Makes wing to the rocky wood".

Henry Vaughan, ^The Bee~: --

     "And hard by shelters on some bough
      Hilarion's servant, the wise crow".

And Tennyson, ^Locksley Hall~: --

     "As the many-wintered crow that leads the
     clanging rookery home".

	|43.~  The spirit of Peter Damiano.

	|46.~  Beatrice.

	|63.~  Because your mortal ear could not endure the sound
of our singing, as your mortal eye could not the splendor of
Beatrice's smile.

	|81.~  As in Canto XII, 3: --

     "Began the holy millstone to revolve".

	|90.~  As in Canto XIV, 40: --

     "Its brightness is proportioned to its ardor,
     The ardor to the vision; and the vision
     Equals what grace it has above its worth".

	|106.~  Among the Apennines, east of Arezzo, rises Mount
Catria, sometimes called, from its forked or double summit, the
^Forca di Fano.~  On its slope stands the monastery of Santa
Croce di Fonte Avellana.  Troya, in his ^Veltro Allegorico~, as
quoted in Balbo's ^Life and Times of Dante~, Mrs. Bunbury's Tr.,
II, 218, describes this region as follows: "The monastery is
built on the steepest mountains of Umbria.  Catria, the giant of
the Apennines, hangs over it, and so overshadows it that in some
months of the year the light is frequently shut out.  A difficult
and lonely path through the forests leads to the ancient
^hospitium~ of these courteous hermits, who point out the
apartments where their predecessors lodged Alighieri.  We may
read his name repeatedly on the walls; the marble effigy of him
bears witness to the honorable care with which the memory of the
great Italian is preserved from age to age in that silent
retirement.  The Prior Moricone received him there in 1318, and
the annals of Avellana relate this event with pride.  But if they
had been silent, it would be quite sufficient to have seen
Catria, and to have read Dante's description of it, to be assured
that he ascended it.  There, from the woody summit of the rock,
he gazed upon his country, and rejoiced in the thought that he
was not far from her.  He struggled with his desire to return to
her; and when he ^was~ able to return, he banished himself anew,
not to submit to dishonor.  Having descended to mountain, he
admired the ancient manners of the inhabitants of Avellana, but
he showed little indulgence to his hosts, who appeard to him to
have lost their old virtues.  At this time, and during his
residence near Gubbio, it seems that he must have written the
five cantos of the Paradiso after the twentieth; because when he
mentions Florence in the twenty-first canto he speaks of Catria,
and in what he says in the twenty-fifth, of wishing to receive
his poetic crown at his baptismal font, we can perceive his hope
to be restored to his country and his beautiful fold (^ovile~)
when time should have overcome the difficulties of the manner of
his return".

	Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, p. 265, describes his visit
to the monastery of Fonte Avellana, and closes thus: --

	"They took particular pleasure in leading us to an echo,
the wonder of Avellana, and the most powerful I ever heard.  It
repeats distinctly a whole line of verse, and even a line and a
half.  I amused myself in making the rocks address to the great
poet, whom they had seen wandering among their summits, what he
said of Homer, --

     ^Onorate l'altissimo poeta.~

The line was distinctly articulated by the voice of the mountain,
which seemed to be the far-off and mysterious voice of the poet
himself...

	"In order to find the recollection of Dante more present
than in the cells, and even in the chamber of the inscription, I
went out at night, and sat upon a stone a little above the
monastery.  The moon was not visible, being still hidden by the
immense peaks; but I could see some of the less elevated summits
struck by her first glimmerings.  The chants of the monks came up
to me through the darkness, and mingled with the bleating of a
kid lost in the mountains.  I saw through the window of the choir
a white monk prostrate in prayer.  I thought that perhaps Dante
had sat upon that stone, that he had contemplated those rocks,
that moon, and heard those chants always the same, like the sky
and the mountains".

	|110.~  This hermitage, according to Butler, ^Lives of
the Saints~, II, 212, was founded by the blessed Ludolf, about
twenty years before Peter Damiano came to it.

	|112.~  Thus it began speaking for the third time.

	|121.~  St. Peter Damiano was born of a poor family at
Ravenna, about 988; and, being left an orphan in his childhood,
went to live with an elder brother, who set him to tending swine. 
Another brother, who was a priest at Ravenna, took compassion on
him, and educated him.  He in turn became a teacher; and, being
of an escetic turn of mind, he called himself Peter the Sinner,
wore a hair shirt, and was assiduous in fasting and prayer.  Two
Benedictine monks of the monastery of Fonte Avellana, passing
through Ravenna, stopped at the house where he lodged; and he
resolved to join their brotherhood, which he did soon afterward.
In 1041 he became Abbot of the monastery, and in 1057,
Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia.  In 1062 he returned to Fonte Avellana;
and in 1072, being "fourscore and three years old", died on his
way to Rome, in the convent of Our Lady near Faenza.

	Of his life at Fonte Avellana, Butler, ^Lives of the
Saints~, (Feb. 23,) II, 217, says: "Whatever austerities he
prescribed to others he was the first to practise himself,
remitting nothing of them even in his old age.  He lived shut up
in his cell as in a prison, fasted every day, except festivals,
and allowed himself no other subsistence than coarse bread, bran,
herbs, and water, and this he never drank fresh, but what he had
kept from the day before.  He tortured his body with iron girdles
and frequent disciplines, to render it more obedient to the
spirit.  He passed the three first days of every Lent and Advent
without taking any kind of nourishment whatsoever; and often for
forty days together lived only on raw herbs and fruits, or on
pulse steeped in cold water, without touching so much as bread,
or anything which had passed the fire.  A mat spread on the floor
was his bed.  He used to make wooden spoons and such like useful
mean things, to exercise himself at certain hours in manual
labor."

	|122.~  It is a question whether Peter Damiano and Peter
the Sinner are the same person, or whether by the latter is meant
Peter Onesti of Ravenna; for both in their humility took that
name.  The solution of the question depends upon the reading
|fui~ or ^fu~ in this line; and of twenty-eight printed editions
consulted by Barlow, fourteen were for |fui~, and fourteen for
^fu.~  Of the older commentators, the ^Ottimo~ thinks two
distinct persons are meant; Benvenuto and Buti decide in favor of
one.

	Benvenuto interprets thus: "In Catria I was called Peter
Damiano, and I was Peter the Sinner in the monastery of Santa
Maria in Porto at Ravenna on the shore of the Adriatic.  Some
persons maintain, that this Peter the Sinner was another monk of
the order, which is evidently false, because Damiano gives his
real name in Catria, and here names himself (Sinner) from
humiltity."

	Buti says: "I was first a friar called Peter the Sinner,
in the Order of Santa Maria...  And afterwards he went from there
to the monastery at the hermitage of Catria, having become a
monk".

	|125.~  In 1057, when he was made Cardinal-Bishop of
Ostia.

	|127.~  Cephas is St. Peter.  ^John~, i, 42: "Thou art
Simon the son of Jona; Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by
interpretation, a stone."  The ^Ottimo~ seems to have forgotten
this passage of Scripture when he wrote: "Cephus, that is, St.
Peter, so called from the large head he had (^cephas~, that is to
say, head)."

	The mighty Vessel of the Holy Spirit is St. Paul. 
^Acts~, ix, 15: "He is a chosen vessel unto me."

	|129.~  ^Luke~, x, 7: "And in the same house remain,
eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is
worthy of his hire."

	|130.~  The commentary of Benvenuto da Imola upon this
passage is too striking to be omitted here.  The reader may
imagine the impression it produced upon the audience when the
Professor first read it publicly in his lectures at Bologna, in
1389, eighty-eight years after Dante's death, though this
impression may have been somewhat softened by its being delivered
in Latin: --

	"Here Peter Damiano openly rebukes the modern shepherds
as being the opposite of the Apostles before-mentioned, saying,

     'Now some one to support them on each side
      The modern shepherds need`;

that is to say, on the right and on the left;
     
     'And some to lead them,
     So heavy are they`;

that is, so fat and corpulent.  I have seen many such at the
court of Rome.  And this is in contrast with the leanness of
Peter and Paul before mentioned.

     'And to hold their trains`,


because they have long cloaks, sweeping the ground with their
trains.  And this too is in contrast with the nakedness of the
afore-mentioned Apostles.  And therefore, stung with grief, he
adds,

     'They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks`,

fat and sleek, as they themselves are; for their mantles are so
long, ample, and capacious, that they cover man and horse.  Hence
he says,

     'So that two beasts go underneath one skin`;

that is, the beast who carries, and he who is carried, and is
more beastly than the beast himself.  And, truly, had the author
lived at the present day he might have changed this phrase and
said,

     'So that three beasts go underneath one skin`;

namely, cardinal, concubine, and horse; as I have heard of one,
whom I knew well, who used to carry his concubine to hunt on the
crupper of his horse or mule.  And truly he was like a horse or
mule, in which there is no understanding; that is, without
reason.  On account of these things, Peter in anger cries out to
God,

     'O Patience, that dost tolerate so much`!"

	|142.~  A cry so loud that he could not distinguish the
words these spirits uttered.
