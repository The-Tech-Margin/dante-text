	|1.~  The Heaven of Mars continued.  The prophecy of
Dante's banishment.

	In ^Inf.~, X, 127, as Dante is meditating on the dark
words of Farinata that foreshadow his exile, Virgil says to him:

     "'Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
     Against thyself`, that sage commanded me,
     'And now attend here`; and he raised his
     finger.
     'When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
     Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
     From her thou'lt learn the journey of thy
     life`."

	And afterwards, in reply to Brunetto Latini, Dante says,
^Inf.~, XV, 88:--
     
     "What you narrate of my career I write,
     And keep it for a lady, who will know,
     To gloss with other text, if e'er I reach her."

The time for this revelation has now come; but it is made by
Cacciaguida, not by Beatrice.

	|3.~  Phaeton, having heard from Epaphus that he was not
the son of Apollo, ran in great eagerness and anxiety to his
mother, Clymene, to ascertain the truth.  Ovid, ^Met.~, I,
Dryden's Tr.:--

     "Mother, said he, this infamy was thrown
     By Epaphus on you, and me your son.
     He spoke in public, told it to my face;
     Nor durst I vindicate the dire disgrace:
     Even I, the bold, the sensible of wrong,
     Restrained by shame, was forced to hold my
     tongue. 
     To hear an open slander, is a curse:
     But not to find an answer, is a worse.
     If I am heaven-begot, assert your son
     By some sure sign; and make my father
     known,
     To right my honor, and redeem your own.
     He said, and, saying, cast his arms about
     Her neck, and begged her to resolve the doubt."

	|3.~  The disaster that befell Phaeton while driving the
steeds of Apollo, makes fathers chary of granting all the wishes
of children.

	|16.~  Who seest in God all possible contingencies as
clearly as the human mind perceives the commonest geometrical
problem.

	|18.~  God, "whose centre is everywhere whose
circumference nowhere."

	|20.~  The heavy words which Dante heard on the mount of
Purgatory, foreshadowing his exile, are those of Currado
Malaspina, ^Purg.~, VIII, 133: 

     "For the sun shall not lie
     Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram
     With all his four feet covers and bestrides,
     Before that such a courteous opinion
     Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed
     With greater nails than of another's speech,
     Unless the course of justice standeth still";

and those of Oderisi d'Agobbio, ^Purg.~, XI, 139:
     
     "I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;
     Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbors
     Will so demean themselves that thou canst
     gloss it."

	|21.~  The words he heard "when descending into the dead
world", are those of Farinata, ^Inf.~, X, 79: 

     "But fifty times shall not rekindled be
     The countenance of the Lady who reigns
     here,
     Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art";

and those of Brunetto Latini, ^Inf.~, XV, 61:
     
     "But that ungrateful and malignant people,
     Which from Fiesole of old descended,
     And smacks still of the mountain and the
     granite,
     Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe."

	|24.~  Aristotle, ^Ethics~, I, ch. 10: "Always and
everywhere the virtuous man bears prosperous and adverse fortune
prudently, as a perfect tetragon."

	|28.~  To the spirit of Cacciaguida.

	|31.~  Not like the ambiguous utterance of oracles in
Pagan times.

	|35.~  The word here rendered Language is in the original
^Latin~; used as in Canto XIII, 144.

	|37.~  Contingency, accident, or casualty, belongs only to
the material world, and in the spiritual world finds no place. 
As Dante makes St. Bernard say, in Canto XXXII, 53:--

     "Within the amplitude of this domain
     No casual point can possibly find place,
     No more than sadness can, or thirst, or
     hunger;
     For by eternal law has been established
     Whatever thou beholdest."

	|40.~  Boethius, ^Consol. Phil.~, V, Prosa 3, Ridpath's
Tr.: "But I shall now endeavor to demonstrate, that, in whatever
way the chain of causes is disposed, the event of things which
are foreseen is necessary; although prescience may not appear to
be the necessitating cause of their befalling.  For example, if a
person sits, the opinion formed of him that he is seated, is of
necessity true; but by inverting the phrase, if the opinion is
true that he is seated, he must necessarily sit.  In both cases
then there is a necessity; in the latter, that the person sits;
in the former, that the opinion concerning him is true: but the
person doth not sit, because the opinion of his sitting is true;
but the opinion is rather true, because the action of his being
seated was antecedent in time.  Thus though the truth of the
opinion may be the effect of the person taking a seat, there is
nevertheless a necessity common to both.  The same method of
reasoning, I think, should be employed with regard to the
prescience of God, and future contingencies; for allowing it to
be true that events are foreseen because they are to happen, and
that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it is still
necessary, that what is to happen must be foreseen by God, and
that what is foreseen must take place."

	And again, in Prosa 4 of the the same Book: "But how is
it possible, said I, that those things which are foreseen should
not befall?  -- I do not say, replied she, that we are to
entertain any doubt but the events will take place, which
Providence foresees are to happen; but we are rather to believe,
that although they do happen, yet that there is no necessity in
the events themselves, which constrains them to do so.  The truth
of which I shall thus endeavor to illustrate.  We behold many
things done under our view, such as a coachman conducting his
chariot and governing his horses, and other things of a like
nature.  Now, do you suppose these things are done by the
compulsion of a necessity?  -- No, answered I; for, if everything
were moved by compulsion, the effects of art would be vain and
fruitless.  -- If things then, which are doing under our eye,
added she, are under no present necessity of happening, it must
be admitted that these same things, before they befell, were
under no necessity of taking place.  It is plain, therefore, that
some things befall, the event of which is altogether
unconstrained by necessity.  For I do not think any person will
say that such things as are at present done, were not to happen
before they were done.  Why, therefore, may not things be
foreseen, and not necessitated in their events?  As the knowledge
then of what is present imposes no necessity on things now done,
so neither does the foreknowledge of what is to happen in future
necessitate the things which are to take place."

	Also Chaucer, ^Troil. and Cres.~, IV, 995:--
     
     Eke, this is an opinion of some
     That have hir top ful high and smoth ishore;
     Thei sain right thus; that thing is nat to come
     For-that the prescience hath sene before,
     That it shal come: but thei sain that therefore
     That it shall come, therefore the purveiaunce
     Wote it beforne withouten ignoraunce.

     "And in this maner, this necessite,
     Retourneth in his place contrary, againe;
     For nedefully, behoveth it nat be,
     That thilke thinges fallen in certaine
     That ben purveyed; but nedefully, as thei saine,
     Behveth it, that thinges which that fall,
     That thei in certaine ben purveyed all:
     
     "I mene, as though I laboured me in this,
     To enquire which thing cause of which thing be,
     As whether that the prescience of God is
     The certaine cause of the necessite
     Of thinges that to comen be, parde,
     Or, if necessite of thing coming
     Be the cause certaine of the purveying?
     
     "But, now, ne enforce I me not, in shewing
     How the order of the causes stant; but wot I,
     That it behoveth that the befalling
     Of thinges, wist@e before certainly,
     Be necessarie -- al seme it not therby
     That prescience put falling necessayre
     To thing to come, al fal it foule or faire:
     
     "For, if there sit a man yonde on a see, --
     Than by necessite behoveth it
     That, certes, thine opinion sothe be
     That wenest or conjectest that he sit.
     And, furtherover, now ayenwarde yet, --
     Lo, right so is it on the part contrarie;
     As thus; now herken, for I wol nat tarie:
     
     "I say, that if the opinion of the
     Be sothe, for-that he sit; than say I this,
     That he mote sitten, by necessite.
     And thus necessite, in either, is.
     For in him nede of sitting is, iwis;
     And in the, nede of sothe: and thus, forsothe,
     There mote necessite ben in you bothe.
     
     "But thou maist saine, the man sit nat therefore
     That thine opinion of his sitting soth is:
     But, rather, for the man sate there before,
     Therefore is thine opinion sothe iwis:
     And I say, Though the cause of sothe of this
     Cometh of his sitting; yet necessite
     Is enterchaunged bothe in him and the."

	|46.~  As Hippolytus was banished from Athens on the
false and cruel accusations of Phaedra, his step-mother, so Dante
shall be from Florence on accusations equally false and cruel.

	|50.~  By instigation of Pope Boniface VIII, in Rome, as
Dante here declares.  In April, 1302, the Bianchi were banished
from Florence on account or under pretext of a conspiracy against
Charles of Valois, who had been called to Florence by Guelfs as
pacificator of Tuscany.  In this conspiracy Dante could have had
no part, as he was then absent on an embassy to Rome.

	Dino Compagni, ^Cron. Flor.~, II, gives a list of many of
the exiles.  Among them is "Dante Aldighieri, ambassador at
Rome"; and at the end of the names given he adds, "and many more,
as many as six hundred men, who wandered here and there about the
world, suffering much want."  At first, the banishment was for
two years only; but a second decree made it for life, with the
penalty that, if any one of the exiles returned to Florence, he
should be burned to death.

	On the exile of Dante, M. Amp@ere has written an
interesting work under the title of ^Voyage Dantesque~, from
which frequent extracts have been made in these notes.  "I have
followed him, step by step", he says, "in the cities where he
lived, in the mountains where he wandered, in the asylums that
welcomed him, always guided by the poem, in which he has
recorded, with all the sentiments of his soul and all the
speculations of his intelligence, all the recollections of his
life; a poem which is no less a confession than a vast
encyclopaedia."

	See also the Letter of Frate Ilario, the passage from the
^Convito~, and Dante's Letter to a Friend, among the
Illustrations at the end of Vol. I.

	|52.~  Boethius, ^Cons. Phil.~, I, Prosa 4, Ridpath's
Tr.: "But my miseries are complete, when I reflect that the
majority of mankind attend less to the merit of things, than to
their fortuitous event; and believe that no undertakings are
crowned with success, but such as are formed with a prudent
foresight.  Hence it is, that the unprosperous immediately lose
the good opinion of mankind.  It would give me pain to relate to
you the rumors that are flying among the people, and the variety
of discordant and inconsistent opinions entertained concerning
me."

	|53.~  At the beginning of ^Inf.~, XXVI, Dante
foreshadows the vengeance of God that is to fall on Florence, and
exclaims: 

     "And if it now were, it were not too soon;
      Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
      For't will aggrieve me more the more I age."

	For an account of these disasters see ^Inf.~, XXVI, Note
9.

	|58.~  Upon this passage Mr. Wright, in the notes to his
translation, makes the following extracts from the Bible,
Shakespeare, and Spenser:

	^Ecclesisticus~, xxix, 24 and xl, 28, 29: "It is a
miserable thing to go from house to house; for where thou art a
stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.  Thou shalt entertaine
and feast, and have no thanks: moreover, thou shalt hear bitter
words...  These things are grievous to a man of understanding, --
the upbraiding of house-room, and reproaching of the lender." 
"My son, lead not a beggar's life, for better it is to die than
to beg.  The life of him that dependeth on another man's table is
not to be counted for a life."  ^Richard II~, III, 1:

     "Myself
     Have stooped my neck under your injuries,
     And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,
     Eating the bitter bread of banishment."

	Spenser, ^Mother Hubberd's Tale~, 895:--
      
     "Full little knowest thou, that hast not tried,
     What Hell it is, in suing long to bide:
     To lose good days, that might be better spent;
     To waste long nights, in pensive discontent;
     To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow;
     To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow;
     To have thy Prince's grace, yet want her Peer's,
     To have thy asking, yet wait many years;
     To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares;
     To eat thy heart with comfortless despairs;
     To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,
     To spend, to give, -- to want, -- to be undone."

	|62.~  Among the fellow-exiles of Dante, as appears by
the list of names preserved, was Lapo Salterello, the Florentine
lawyer, of whom Dante speaks so contemptuously in Canto XV, 128. 
Benvenuto says he was "a litigious and loquacious man, and very
annoying to Dante during his exile.  Altogether the company of
his fellow-exiels seems to have been disagreeable to him, and it
better suited him to "make a party by himself."

	|66.~  Shall blush with shame.

	|71.~  Bartolommeo della Scala, Lord of Verona.  The arms
of the Scaligers were a golden ladder in a red field, surmounted
by a black eagle.  "For a tyrant", says Benvenuto, "he was
reputed just and prudent."

	|76.~  Can Grande della Scala, at this time only nine
years old, but showing, says Benvenuto, "that he would be a true
son of Mars, bold and prompt in battle, and victorious
exceedingly."  He was a younger brother of Bartolommeo, and
became sole Lord of Verona in 1311.  He was the chief captain of
the Ghibellines, and his court the refuge of some of the
principal of the exiles.  Dante was there in 1317 with Guido da
Castello and Uguccione della Faggiuola.  To Can Grande he
dedicated some cantos of the Paradiso, and presented them with
that long Latin letter so difficult to associate with the name of
Dante.

	At this time the court of Verona seems to have displayed
a kind of barbaric splendor and magnificence, as if in imitation
of the gay court of Frederick II, of Sicily.  Arrivabene,
^Comento Storico~, III, 255, says: "Can Grande gathered around
him those distinguished personages whom unfortunate reverses had
driven from their country; but he also kept in his pay buffoons
and musicians, and other merry persons, who were more caressed by
the courtiers than the men famous for their deeds and learning. 
One of the guests was Sagacio Muzio Gazzata, the historian of
Reggio, who has left us an account of the treatment which the
illustrious and unfortunate exiles received.  Various apartments
were assigned to them in the palace, designated by various
symbols; a Triumph for the warriors; Groves of the Muses for the
poets; Mercury for the artists; Paradise for the preachers; and
for all, inconstant Fortune.  Can Grande likewise received at his
court his illustrious prisoners of war, Giacomo di Carrara, Vanne
Scornazano, Albertino Mussato, and many others.  All had their
private attendants, and a table equally well served.  At times
Can Grande invited some of them to his own table, particularly
Dante, and Guido di Castel of Reggio, exiled from his country
with the friends of liberty, and who for his simplicity was
called 'the Simple Lombard`."

	The harmony of their intercourse seems finally to have
been interrupted, and Dante to have fallen into that disfavor
which he hints at below, hoping that, having been driven from
Florence, he may not also be driven from Verona: 

     "That, if the dearest place be taken from me,
     I may not lose the others by my songs."

	Balbo, ^Life of Dante~, Mrs. Bunbury's Tr., II, 207,
says: "History, tradition, and the after fortunes of Dante, all
agree in proving that there was a rupture between him and Cane;
if it did not amount to a quarrel, there seems to have been some
misunderstanding between the magnificent protector and his
haughty client.  But which of the two was in fault?  I have
collected all the memorials that remain relating to this, and let
every one judge for himself.  But I must warn my readers that
Petrarch, the second of the three fathers of the Italian
language, showed much less veneration than our good Boccaccio for
their common predecessor Dante.  Petrarch speaks as follows: 'My
fellow-citizen, Dante Alighieri, was a man highly distinguished
in the vulgar tongue, but in his style and speech a little daring
and rather freer than was pleasing to delicate and studious ears,
or gratifying to the princes of our times.  He then, while
banished from his country, resided at the court of Can Grande,
where the afflicted universally found consolation and an asylum. 
He at first was held in much honor by Cane, but afterwards he by
degrees fell out of favor, and day by day less pleased that lord. 
Actors and parasites of every description used to be collected
together at the same banquet; one of these, most impudent in his
words and in his obscene gestures, obtained much importance and
favor with many.  And Cane, suspecting that Dante disliked this,
called the man before him, and, having greatly praised him to our
poet, said: "I wonder how it is that this silly fellow should
know how to please all, and should be loved by all, and that thou
canst not, who art said to be so wise"!  Dante answered: "Thou
wouldst not wonder if thou knewest that friendship is founded on
similarity of habits and dispositions`."

	It is also related, that at his table, which was too
indiscriminately hospitable, where buffoons sat down with Dante,
and where jests passed which must have been offensive to every
person of refinement, but disgraceful when uttered by the
superior in rank to his inferior, a boy was once concealed under
the table, who, collecting the bones that were thrown there by
the guests, according to the custom of those times, heaped them
up at Dante's feet.  When the tables were removed, the great heap
appearing, Cane pretended to show much astonishment, and said,
'Certainly, Dante is a great devourer of meat`.  To which Dante
readily replied, 'My lord, you would not have seen so many bones
had I been a dog (^cane~)`."

	Can Grande died in the midst of his wars, in July, 1329,
from drinking at a fountain.  A very lively picture of his court,
and of the life that Dante led there, is given by Ferrari in his
comedy of ^Dante a Verona.~

	|82.~  The Gascon is Clement V, Archbishop of Bordeaux,
and elected Pope in 1305.  The noble Henry is the Emperor Henry
of Luxemburg, who, the ^Ottimo~ says, "was valiant in arms,
liberal and courteous, compassionate and gentle, and the friend
of virtue."  Pope Clement is said to have been secretly his
enemy, while publicly he professed to be his friend; and finally
to have instigated or connived at his death by poison.  See
^Purg.~, VI, Note 97.  Henry came to Italy in 1310, when Can
Grande was about nineteen years of age.
