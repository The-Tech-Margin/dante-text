	|1.~  Chaucer, ^Second Nonnes Tale~: --

     "Thou maide and mother, doughter of thy son,
     Thou well of mercy, sinful soules cure,
     In whom that God of bountee chees to won;
     Thou humble and high over every creature,
     Thou nobledest so fer forth our nature,
     That no desdaine the maker had to kinde
     His son in blood and flesh to clothe and winde.
     
     "Within the cloystre blisful of thy sides,
     Toke mannes shape the eternal love and pees,
     That of the trine compas Lord and gide is,
     Whom erthe, and see, and heven out of relees
     Ay herien; and thou, virgine wemmeles,
     Bare of thy body (and dweltest maiden pure)
     The creatour of every creature.
     
     "Assembled is in thee magnificence
     With mercy, goodnesse, and with swiche pitee,
     That thou, that art the sonne of excellence,
     Not only helpest hem that praien thee,
     But oftentime of thy benignitee
     Ful freely, or than men thin helpe beseche,
     Thou goest beforne, and art hir lives leche."

Nostre Dame.~

	|36.~  As St. Marcarius said to his soul: "Having taken
up thine abode in heaven, where thou hast God and his holy angels
to converse with, see that thou descend not thence; regard not
earthly things.

	|48.~  Finished the ardor of desire in its
accomplishment.

	|66.~  ^Aeneid~, III, 442, Davidson's Tr., "When, wafted
thither, you reach the city Cumae, the hallowed lakes, and
Avernus resounding through the woods, you will see the raving
prophetess, who, beneath a deep rock, reveals the fates, and
commits to the leaves of trees her characters and words. 
Whatever verses the virgin has inscribed on the leaves, she
ranges in harmonious order, and leaves in the cave enclosed by
themselves: uncovered they remain in their position, nor recede
from their order.  But when, upon turning the hinge, a small
breath of wind has blown upon them, and the door [by opening]
hath discomposed the tender leaves, she never afterward cares to
catch the verses as they are fluttering in the hollow cave, nor
to recover their situation, or join them together."

	|78.~  ^Luke~, ix, 62: "No man having put his hand to the
plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."

	|86.~  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sam. Theol.~, I Qaest., iv, 2:
"If therefore God be the first efficient cause of things, the
perfections of all things must pre-exist pre-eminently in God." 
And Buti: "In God are all things that are made, as in the First
Cause, that foresees everything."

	|90.~  Of all the commentaries which I have consulted,
that of Buti alone sustains this rendering of the line.  The rest
interpret it, "What I say is but a simple of feeble glimmer of
what I saw."

	|94.~  There are almost as many interpretations of this
passage as there are commentators.  The most intelligible is,
that Dante forgot in a single moment more of the glory he had
seen, than the world had forgotten in five and twenty centuries
of the Argonautic expedition, when Neptune wondered at the shadow
of the first ship that ever crossed the sea.

	|103.~  Aristotle, ^Ethics~, I, 1, Gillie's Tr.: "Since
every art and every kind of knowledge, as well as all the actions
and all the deliberations of men, constantly aim at something
which they call good, good in general may be justly defined, that
which all desire."

	|114.~  In the same manner the reflection of the Griffin
in Beatrice's eyes, ^Purg.~, XXXI, 124, is described as changing,
while the object itself remained unchanged: --

     "Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,
     When I beheld the thing itself stand still,
     And in its image it transformed itself."

	|115.~  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I Quaest., xxix,
2: "What exists by itself, and not in another, is called
subsistence."

	|116.~  The three Persons of the Trinity.

	|128.~  The second circle, or second Person of the
Trinity.

	|131.~  The human nature of Christ; the incarnation of
the Word.

	|141.~  In this new light of God's grace, the mystery of
the union of the Divine and human nature in Christ is revealed to
Dante.

	|144.~  Wordsworth, ^Resolution and Independence~: --

                                "As a cloud...
     That heareth not the loud winds when they call,
     And moveth all together, if it move at all."

	|145.~  I ^John~, iv, 16: "God is love; and he that
dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
