	|1.~  The Heaven of Jupiter continued.

	|12.~  The eagle speaks as one person, though composed of
a multitude of spirits.  Here Dante's idea of unity under the
Empire finds expression.

	|28.~  This mirror of Divine Justice is the planet Saturn,
to which Dante alludes in Canto IX. 61, where, speaking of the
Intelligences of Saturn, he says: --

     "Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,
     From which shines out on us God Judicant."

	|32.~  Whether a good life outside the pale of the holy
Catholic faith could lead to Paradise.

	|37.~  Dante here calls the blessed spirits lauds, or
"praises of the grace divine," as in ^Inf.~ II. 103 he calls
Beatrice "the true praise of God."

	|40.~  Mr. Cary quotes, ^Proverbs~ viii. 27: "When he
prepared the heavens, I was there; when he set a compass upon the
face of the depth,.... then I was by him."

	And Milton, ^Par. Lost~, VII. 224: --

                         "And in his hand
     He took the golden compasses, prepared
     In God's eternal store, to circumscribe
     This Universe, and all created things.
     One foot he centred, and the other turned
     Round through the vast profundity obscure,
     And said: `Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,
     This by thy just circumference, O World!'"

	|44.~  The Word or Wisdom of the Deity far exceeds any
manifestation of it in the creation.

	|48.~  Shakespeare, ^Henry VIII.~, III.: --

                "Fling away ambition,
     By that sin fell the angels."

	|49.~  Dryden, ^Religio Laici~, 39: --

     "How can the less the greater comprehend?
     Or finite reason reach infinity?
     For what could fathom God is more than He."

	|54.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, VII. 168: --

     "Boundless the deep, because I Am, who fill
     Infinitude, nor vacuous the space."

	|55.~  The human mind can never be so powerful but that it
will perceive the Divine Mind to be infinitely beyond its
comprehension; or, as Buti interprets, -- reading ^gli @e
parvente~, which reading I have followed, -- "much greater than
what appears to the human mind, and what the human intellect
sees."

	|65.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, I. 63: --

     "No light, but rather darkness visible."

	|104.~  ^Galatians~ iii. 23: "But before faith came, we
were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should
afterwards be revealed."

	|106.~  Matthew vii. 21: "Not every one that saith unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."

	|108.~  Dryden, ^Religio Laici~, 208: --

     "Then those who followed Reason's dictates right,
     Lived up, and lifted high her natural light,
     With Socrates may see their Maker's face,
     While thousand rubric martyrs want a place."

	|109.~  Matthew xii. 41: "The men of Nineveh shall rise in
judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it."

	|110.~  The righteous and the unrighteous at the day of
judgment.

	|113.~  ^Revelation~ xx. 12: "And I saw the dead, small
and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and
another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead
were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their works."

	|115.~  This is the "German Albert" of ^Purg.~ VI. 97: --

     "O German Albert, who abandonest her
       That has grown savage and indomitable,
       And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,
     May a just judgment from the stars down fall
       Upon thy blood, and be it new and open
       That thy successor may have fear thereof;
     Because thy father and thyself have suffered,
       By greed of those transalpine lands distrained
       The garden of the empire to be waste."

	The deed which was so soon to move the pen of the
Recording Angel was the invasion of Bohemia in 1303.

	|120.~  Philip the Fair of France, who, after his defeat
at Courtray in 1302, falsified the coin of the realm, with which
he paid his troops.  He was killed in 1314 by a fall from his
horse, caused by the attack of a wild boar.  Dante uses the word
|cotenna~, the skin of the wild boar, for the boar itself.

	|122.~  The allusion here is to the border wars between
John Baliol of Scotland, and Edward I. of England.

	|125.~  Most of the commentators say that this king of
Spain was one of the Alphonsos, but do not agree as to which one.
Tommaseo says it was Ferdinand IV. (1295-1312), and he is probably
right.  It was this monarch, or rather his generals, who took
Gibraltar from the Moors.  In 1312 he put to death unjustly the
brothers Carvajal, who on the scaffold summoned him to appear
before the judgment seat of God within thirty days; and before
the time had expired he was found dead upon his sofa.  From this
event he received the surname of ^El Emplazado~, the Summoned.
It is said that his death was caused by intemperance.

	The Bohemian is Winceslaus II., son of Ottocar.  He is
mentioned, ^Purg.~ VII. 101, as one "who feeds in luxury and
ease."

	|127.~  Charles II., king of Apulia, whose virtues may be
represented by a unit and his vices by a thousand.  He was called
the "Cripple of Jerusalem," on account of his lameness, and
because as king of Apulia he also bore the title of King of
Jerusalem.  See ^Purg.~ XX.  Note 79.

	|131.~  Frederick, son of Peter of Aragon, and king, or in
some form ruler of Sicily, called from Mount Etna the "Island of
the Fire."  The ^Ottimo~ comments thus: "Peter of Aragon was
liberal and magnanimous, and the author says that this man is
avaricious and pusillanimous."  Perhaps his greatest crime in the
eyes of Dante was his abandoning the cause of the Imperialists.

	|132.~  According to Virgil, Anchises died in Sicily, "on
the joyless coast of Drepanum." AEneid, III. 708, Davidson's
Tr.: "Here, alas! after being tossed by so many storms at sea, I
lose my sire Anchises, my solace in every care and suffering.
Here thou, best of fathers, whom in vain, alas!  I saved from so
great dangers, forsakest me, spent with toils."

	|134.~  In diminutive letters, and not in Roman capitals,
like the DILIGITE JUSTITIAM of Canto XVIII. 91, and the record of
the virtues and vices of the "Cripple of Jerusalem."

	|137.~  The uncle of Frederick of Sicily was James, king
of the Balearic Islands.  He joined Philip the Bold of France in
his disastrous invasion of Catalonia; and in consequence lost his
own crown.

	The brother of Frederick was James of Aragon, who, on
becoming king of that realm, gave up Sicily, which his father has
acquired.

	By these acts they dishonored their native land and the
crowns they wore.

	|139.~  Dionysius, king of Portugal, who reigned from 1279
to 1325.  The ^Ottimo~ says that, "given up wholly to the
acquisition of wealth, he led the life of a merchant, and had
money dealings with all the great merchants of his reign; nothing
regal, nothing magnificent, can be recorded of him."

	Philalethes is disposed to vindicate the character of
Dionysius against these aspersions, and to think them founded
only in the fact that Dionysius loved the arts of peace better
than the more shining art of war, joined in no crusade against
the Moors, and was a patron of manufactures and commerce.

	The ^Ottimo's~ note on this nameless Norwegian is
curious: "As his islands are situated at the uttermost
extremities of the earth, so his life is on the extreme of
reasonableness and civilization."

	Benvenuto remarks only that "Norway is a cold northern
region, where the days are very short, and whence come excellent
falcons."  Buti is still more brief.  He says: "That is, the king
of Norway."  Neither of these commentators, nor any of the later
ones, suggest the name of this monarch, except the Germans,
Philalethes ad Witte, who think it may be Eric the Priest-hater,
or Hakon Longshanks.

	|140.~  Rascia or Ragusa is a city in Dalmatia, situated
on the Adriatic, and capital of the kingdom of that name.  The
king here alluded to is Uroscius II., who married a daughter of
the Emperor Michael Palaeologus, and counterfeited the Venetian
coin.

	|141.~  In this line I have followed the reading ^male ha
visto~, instead of the more common one, ^male aggiust@o.~

	|142.~  The ^Ottimo~ comments as follows: "Here he
reproves the vile and unseemly lives of the kings of Hungary,
down to Andrea" (Dante's contemporary), "whose life the
Hungarians praised, and whose death they wept."

	|144.~  If it can make the Pyrenees a bulwark to protect
it against the invasion of Philip the Fair of France.  It was not
till four centuries later that Louis XIV. made his famous boast,
"^Il n'y a plus de Pyr$en$ees."

	|145.~  In proof of this prediction the example of Cyprus
is given.

	|146.~  Nicosia and Famagosta are cities of Cyprus, here
taken for the whole island, in 1300 badly governed by Henry II.
of the house of the Lusignani.  "And well he may call him beast,"
say the ^Ottimo~, "for he was wholly given up to lust and
sensuality, which should be far removed from every king."

	|148.~  Upon this line Benvenuto comments with unusual
vehemence.  "This king," he says, "does not differ nor depart from
the side of the other beasts; that is, of the other vicious
kings.  And of a truth, Cyprus with her people differeth not, nor
is separated from the bestial life of the rest; rather it
surpasseth and exceedeth all peoples and kings of the kingdoms of
Christendom in superfluity of luxury, gluttony, effeminacy, and
every kind of pleasure.  But to attempt to describe the kinds,
the sumptuousness, the variety, and the frequency of their
banquets, would be disgusting to narrate, and tedious and harmful
to write.  Therefore men who live soberly and temperately should
avert their eyes from beholding, and their ears from hearing, the
meretricious, lewd, and fetid manners of that island, which, with
God's permission, the Genoese have now invaded, captured, and
evil entreated and laid under contribution."
