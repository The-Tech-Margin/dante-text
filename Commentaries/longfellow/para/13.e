	|1.~  The Heaven of the Sun continued.  Let the reader
imagine fifteen of the largest stars, and to these add the seven
of Charles's Wain, and the two last stars of the Little Bear,
making in all twenty-four, and let him arrange them in two
concentric circles, revolving in opposite directions, and he will
have the image of what Dante now beheld.

	|7.~  ^Iliad~, XVIII. 487: "The Bear, which they also call
by the appellation of the Wain, which there revolves and watches
Orion; but it alone is free from the baths of the ocean."

	|10.~  The constellation of the Little Bear as much
resembles a horn as it does a bear.  Of this horn the Pole Star
forms the smaller end.

	|14.~  Ariadne, whose crown was, at her death, changed by
Bacchus into a constellation.

	Ovid, ^Met.~, VIII., Croxall's Tr.:--

    "And bids her crown among the stars be placed,
     With an eternal constellation graced.
     The golden circlet mounts; and, as if flies,
     Its diamonds twinkle in the distant skies;
     There, in their pristine form, the gemmy rays
     Between Alcides and the dragon blaze."

Chaucer, ^Legende of good women~:--

     "And in the sygne of Taurus men may se
     The stones of hire corowne shyne clere."

And Spenser, ^Faerie Queene~, VI.  x. 13: --

    "Looke!  how the crowne which Ariadne wore
     Upon her yvory forehead that same day
     That Theseus her unto his bridale bore,
     When the bold Centaures made that bloudy fray
     With the fierce Lapithes which did them dismay,
     Being now placed in the firmament,
     Through the bright heaven doth her beams display,
     And is unto the starres an ornament,
    Which round about her move in order excellent."

	|23.~  The Chiana empties into the Arno near Arezzo.  In
Dante's time it was a sluggish stream, stagnating in the marshes
of Valdichiana.  See ^Inf.~ XXIX.  Note 46.

	|24.~  The ^Primum Mobile.~

	|32.~  St. Thomas Aquinas, who had related the life of
St. Francis.

	|34.~  The first doubt in Dante's mind was in regard to
the expression in Canto X. 96,

     "Where well one fattens if he strayeth not," 

which was explained by Thomas Aquinas in Canto XI.  The second, which
he now prepares to thresh out, is in Canto X. 114,

     "To see so much there never rose a second," 

referring to Solomon, as being peerless in knowledge.

	|37.~  Adam.

	|40.~  Christ.

	|48.~  Solomon.

	|52.~  All things are but the thought of God, and by him
created in love.

	|55.~  The living Light, the Word, proceeding from the
Father, is not separated from Him nor from his Love, the Holy
Spirit.

	|58.~  Its rays are centred in the nine choirs of Angels,
ruling the nine heavens, here called subsistences, according to
the definition of Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, Quaest.
xxix. 2: "What exists by itself, and not in anything else, is
called subsistence."

	|61.~  From those nine heavens it descends to the
elements, the lowest potencies, till it produces only imperfect
and perishable results, or mere contingencies.

	|64.~  These contingencies are animals, plants, and the
like, produced by the influences of the planets from seeds, and
certain insects and plants, believed of old to be born without
seed.

	|67.~  Neither their matter nor the influences of the
planets being immutable, the stamp of the divinity is more or
less clearly seen in them, and hence the varieties in plants and
animals.

	|73.~  If the matter were perfect, and the divine
influence at its highest power, the result would likewise be
perfect; but by transmission through the planets it becomes more
and more deficient, the hand of nature trembles, and imperfection
is the result.

	|79.~  But if Love (the Holy Spirit) and the Vision (the
Son), proceeding from the Primal Power (the Father), act
immediately, then the work is perfect, as in Adam and the human
nature of Christ.

	|89.~  Then how was Solomon so peerless, that none like
him ever existed?

	|93.~  1 ^Kings~ iii. 5: "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to
Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give
thee.....  Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to
judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for
who is able to judge this thy so great a people?  And the speech
pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.  And God
said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not
asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked
for thyself understanding to discern judgment, Behold, I have
done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before
thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee."

	|98.~  The number of the celestial Intelligences, or
Regents of the Planets.

	|99.~  Whether from two premises, one of which is
necessary, and the other contingent, or only possible, the
conclusion drawn will be necessary; which Buti says is a question
belonging to "the garrulity of dialectics."

	|100.~  Whether the existence of a first motion is to be
conceded.

	|102.~  That is, a triangle, one side of which shall be
the diameter of the circle.

	|103.~  If thou notest, in a word, that Solomon did not
ask for wisdom in astrology, nor in dialects, nor in metaphysics,
nor in geometry.

	|104.~  The peerless seeing is a reference to Canto X.
114: --

     "To see so much there never rose a second."

It will be observed the word "rose" is the Biblical word in the
phrase "neither after three shall any arise like unto thee," as
given in note 93.

	|125.~  Parmenides was an Eleatic philosopher, and pupil
of Xenophanes.  According to Ritter, ^Hist. Anc. Phil.~, I.
450, Morrison's Tr., his theory was, that "Being is uncreated and
unchangeable, --

     `Whole and self-generate, unchangeable, illimitable,
      Never was nor yet shall be its birth; All is already
      One from eternity.'"

	And farther on: "It is but a mere human opinion that
things are produced and decay, are and are not, and change place
and color.  The whole has its principle in itself, and is in
eternal rest; for powerful necessity holds it within the bonds of
its own limits, and encloses it on all sides: being cannot be
imperfect; for it is not in want of anything, -- for if it were
so, it would be in want of all."

	Melissus of Samos was a follower of Parmenides, and
maintained substantially the same doctrines.

	Brissus was a philosopher of less note.  Mention is
hardly made of him in the histories of philosophy, except as one
of those who pursued that ^Fata Morgana~ of mathematicians, the
quadrature of the circle.

	|127.~  "Infamous heresiarchs," exclaims Venturi, "put as an
example of innumerable others, who, having erred in the understanding
of the Holy Scriptures, persevered in their errors."

	Sabellius was by birth an African, and flourished as
Presbyter of Ptolemais, in the third century.  He denied the
three persons in the Godhead, maintaining that the Son and Holy
Ghost were only temporary manifestations of God in creation,
redemption, and sanctification, and would finally return to the
Father.

	Arius was a Presbyter of Alexandria in the fourth
century.  He believed the Son to be equal in power with the
Father, but of a different essence or nature, a doctrine which
gave rise to the famous Heterousian and Homoiousian controversy,
that distracted the Church for three hundred years.

	These doctrines of Sabellius and of Arius are both
heretical, when tried by the standard of the ^Quicunque vult~,
the authoritative formula of the Catholic faith; "which faith,
except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he
shall perish everlastingly," says St. Athanasius, or some one in
his name.

	|128.~  These men, say some of the commentators, were as
swords that mutilated and distorted the Scriptures.  Others, that
in them the features of the Scriptures were distorted, as the
features of a man reflected in the grooved or concave surface of
a sword.

	|139.~  Names used to indicate any common simpletons and
gossips.

	|141.~  In writing this line Dante had evidently in mind
the beautiful wise words of St. Francis: "What every one is in
the eyes of God, that he is, and no more."

	Mr. Wright, in the notes to his translation, here quotes
the well-known lines of Burns, ^Address to the Unco Guid~: --

     "Then gently scan your brother man,
        Still gentler sister woman;
      Though they may gang a kennin' wrang,
        To step aside is human:
      One point must still be greatly dark,
        The moving why they do it:
      And just as lamely can ye mark
        How far perhaps they rue it.

     "Who made the heart, 't is He alone
        Decidedly can try us;
      He knows each chord -- its various tone,
        Each spring -- its various bias.
      Then at the balance let's be mute;
        We never can adjust it;
      What's done we partly may compute,
        But know not what's resisted."
