	|1.~  The Primum Mobile, or Crystalline Heaven,
continued.

	|3.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, IV, 505: --

                       "Thus these two,
     Imparadised in one another's arms,
     The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill
     Of bliss on bliss."

	|14.~  That Crystalline Heaven, which Dante calls a
volume, or scroll, as in Canto XXIII, 112: --

     "The regal mantle of the volumes all."

	|16.~  The light of God, represented as a single point,
to indicate its unity and indivisibility.

	|32.~  Iris, or the rainbow.

	|34.~  These nine circles of fire are the nine Orders of
Angels in the three Celestial Hierarchies.  Dante, ^Convito~, II,
16, says that the Holy Church divides the Angels into "three
Hierarchies, that is to say, three holy or divine Principalities;
and each Hierarchy had three Orders; so that the Church believes
and affirms nine Orders of spiritual beings.  The first is that
of the Angels; the second, that of the Archangels; the third,
that of the Thrones.  And these three Orders form the first
Hierarchy; not first in reference to rank nor creation (for the
others are more noble, and all were created together), but first
in reference to our ascent to their height.  Then follow the
Dominions; next the Virtues; then the Principalities; and these
form the second Hierarchy.  Above these are the Powers, and the
Cherubim, and above all are the Seraphim; and these form the
third Hierarchy."

	It will be observed that this arrangement of the several
Orders does not agree with that followed in the poem.

	|55.~  Barlow, ^Study of the Div. Com.~, p. 533, remarks:
"Within a circle of ineffable joy, circumscribed only by light
and love, a point of intense brightness so dazzled the eyes of
Dante that he could not sustain the sight of it.  Around this
vivid centre, from which the heavens and all nature depend, nine
concentric circles of the Celestial Hierarchy revolved with a
velocity inversely proportioned to their distance from it, the
nearer circles moving more rapidly, the remoter ones less.  The
poet at first is surprised at this, it being the reverse of the
relative movement, from the same source of propulsion, of the
heavens themselves around the earth as their centre.  But the
infallible Beatrice assures him that this difference arises, in
fact, from the same cause, proximity to the Divine presence,
which in the celestial spheres is greater the farther they are
from the centre, but in the circles of angles, on the contrary,
it is greater the nearer they are to it."

	|60.~  Because the subject has not been investigated and
discussed.

	|64.~  The nine heavens are here called corporal circles,
as we call the stars the heavenly bodies.  Latimer says: "A
corporal heaven,... where the stars are."

	|70.~  The ^Primum Mobile~, in which Dante and Beatrice
now are.

	|77.~  The nearer God the circle is, so much greater
virtue it possesses.  Hence the outermost of the heavens,
revolving roun the earth, corresponds to the innermost of the
Orders of Angels revolving round God, and is controlled by it as
its Regent or Intelligence.  To make this more intelligible I
will repeat here the three Triads of Angels, and the heavens of
which they are severally the Intelligences, as already given in
Canto II, Note 131.

	The Seraphim, Primum Mobile.

	The Cherubim, The Fixed Stars.

	The Thrones, Saturn.

	The Dominions, Jupiter.

	The Virtues, Mars.

	The Powers, The sun.

	The Principalities, Venus.

	The Archangels, Mercury.

	The Angels, The Moon.

	|80.~  ^Aeneid~, XII, 365, Davidson's Tr.: "As when the
blast of Thracian Boreas roars on the Aegean Sea, and to the
shore pursues the waves, wherever the winds exert their incumbent
force, the clounds fly through the air."

	Each of the four winds blows three different blasts;
either directly in front, or from the right cheek, or the left. 
According to Boccaccio, the northeast wind in Italy is milder
than the northwest.

	|90.~  Dante uses this comparison before, Canto I, 60 --

     "But I beheld it sparkle round about
     Like iron that comes molten from the fire."

	|93.~  The inventor of the game of chess brought it to a
Persian king, who was so delighted with it, that he offered him
in return whatever reward he might ask.  The inventor said he
wished only a grain of wheat, doubled as many times as there were
squares on the chess-board; that is, one grain for the first
square, two for the second, four for the third, and so on to
sixty-four.  This the king readily granted; but when the amount
was reckoned up, he had not wheat enough in his whole kingdom to
pay it.

	|95.~  Their appointed place or whereabout.

	|99.~  Thomas Aquinas, the ^Doctor Angelicus~ of the
Schools, treats the subject of Angels at great length in the
first volume of his ^Summa Theologica~, from Quaest. L. to LXIV,
and from Quaest. CVI, to CXIV.  He constantly quotes Dionysius,
sometimes giving his exact words, but oftener amplifying and
interpreting his meaning.  In Quaest. CVIII he discusses the
names of the angels, and of the Seraphim and Cherubim speaks as
follows: --

	"The name of Seraphim is not given from love alone, but
from excess of love, which the name of heat or burning implies. 
Hence Dionysius (Cap. VII, ^Coel. Hier.~, a princ.) interprets
the name Seraphim according to the properties of fire, in which
is excess of heat.  In fire, however, we may consider three
things.  First, a certain motion which is upward, and which is
continuous; by which is signified, that they are unchangingly
moving towards God.  Secondly, its active power, which is
heat;... and by this is signified the influence of this kind of
Angels, which they exercise powerfully on those beneath them,
exciting them to a sublime favor, and thoroughly purifying them
by burning.  Thirdly, in fire its brightness must be considered;
and this signifies that such Angels have within themselves an
inextinguishable light, and that they perfectly illuminate
others.

	"In the same way the name of Cherubim is given from a
certain excess of knowledge; hence it is interpreted ^plenitudo
scientiae~; which Dionysius (Cap. VII, ^Coel. Hier.~, a princ.)
explains in four ways: first, as perfect vision of God; secondly,
full reception of divine light; thirdly, that in God himself they
contemplate the beauty of the order of things emanating from God;
fourthly, that, being themselves full of this kind of knowledge,
they copiously pour it out upon others."

	|100.~  The love of God, which holds them fast to this
central point as with a band.  ^Job~, XXXVIII, 31: "Canst thou
bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of
Orion?"

	|104.~  Canto IX, 61:--

     "Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,
      From which shines out on us God Judicant."

	Of the Thrones, Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, CVIII, 5,
says: "The Order of Thrones excels the inferior Orders in this,
that it has the power of perceiving immediately in God the
reasons of the Divine operations...  Dionysius (Cap. VII, ^Coel.
Hier.~) explains the name of Thrones from their resemblance to
material chairs, in which four things are to be considered. 
First, in reference to position, because chairs are raised above
the ground; and thus these Angels, which are called Thrones, are
raised so far that they can perceive immediately in God the
reasons of things.  Secondly, in material chairs firmness must be
considered, because one sits firmly in them; but this is ^e
converso~, for the Angels themselves are made firm by God. 
Thirdly, because the chair receives the sitter, and he can be
carried in it; and thus the Angels receive God in themselves, and
in a certain sense carry him to their inferiors.  Fourthly, from
their shape, because the chair is open on one side, to receive
the sitter; and thus these Angels, by their promptitude, are open
to receive God and to serve him."

	|110.~  Dante, ^Convito~, I, 1, says: "Knowledge is the
ultimate perfection of our soul, in which consists our ultimate
felicity."  It was one of the great questions of the Schools,
whether the beatitude of the soul consisted in knowing or in
living.  Thomas Aquinas maintains the former part of this
proposition, and Duns Scotus the latter.

	|113.~  By the grace of God, and the co-operation of the
good will of the recipient.

	|116.~  The perpetual spring of Paradise, which knows no
falling autumnal leaves, no season in which Aries is a nocturnal
sign.

	|122.~  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I Quaest. CVIII,
6, says: "And thus Dionysius (Cap. VII, ^Coel. Hier.~), from the
names of the Orders inferring the properties thereof, placed in
the first Hierarchy those Orders whose names were given them in
reference to God, namely, the ^Seraphim~, ^Cherubim~, and
^Thrones~; but in the middle Hierarchy he placed those whose
names designate a certain common government or disposition, that
is, the ^Dominions~, ^Virtues~, and ^Powers~; and in the third
Order he placed those whose names designate the execution of the
work, namely, the ^Principalitis~, ^Angels~, and ^Archangels.~ 
...But to the rule of government three things belong, the first
of which is the distinction of the things to be done, which is
the province of the ^Dominions~; the second is to provide the
faculty of fulfilling, which belongs to the ^Virtues~; but the
third is to arrange in what way the things prescribed, or
defined, can be fulfilled, so that some one may execute them, and
this belongs to the ^Powers.~  But the execution of the angelic
ministry consists in announcing things divine.  In the execution,
however, of any act, there are some who begin the act, and lead
the others, as in singing the precentors, and in battle those who
lead and direct the rest; and this belongs to the
^Principalities.~  There are others who simply execute, and this
is the part of the ^Angels.~  Others hold an intermediate
position, which belongs to the ^Archangels.~"

	|130.~  The Athenian convert of St. Paul. ^Acts~, XVII,
34: "Howbeit, certain men clave unto him, and believed; among the
which was Dionysius the Areopagite."  Dante places him among the
theologians in the Heaven of the Sun.  See Canto X, 115: --

     "Near by behold the lustre of that taper,
     Which in the flesh below looked most within
     The angelic nature and its ministry."

To Dionysius was attributed a work, called ^The Celestial
Hierarchy~, which is the great storehouse of all that relates to
the nature and operations of Angels.  Venturi calls him "the
false Areopagite"; and Dalbaeus, ^De script. Dion. Areop.~, says
that this work was not known till the sixth century.

	The ^Legenda Aurea~ confounds St. Dionysius the
Areopagite with St. Denis, Bishop of Paris in the third century,
and patron saint of France.  It says he was called the Areopagite
from the quarter where he lived; that he was surnamed Theosoph,
or the Wise in God; that he was converted, not by the preaching
of St. Paul, but by a miracle the saint wrough in restoring a
blind man to sight; and that "the woman named Damaris", who was
converted with him, was his wife.  It quotes from a letter of his
to Polycarp, written from Egypt, where he was with his friend and
fellow-student Apollophanes, and where he witnessed the darkening
of the sun at the Crucifixion: "We were both at Heliopolis, when
suddenly we saw the moon conceal the surface of the sun, though
this was not the time for an eclipse, and this darkness continued
for three hours, and the light returned at the ninth hour and
lasted till evening."  And finally it narrates, that when
Dionysius was beheaded, in Paris, where he had converted many
souls and built many churches, "straightway the body arose, and,
taking its head in its arms, led by an angel, and surrounded by a
celestial light, carried it a distance of two miles, from a place
called the Mount of Martyrs, to the place where it now reposes."

	For an account of the ^Celestial Hierarchy~, see Canto X,
Note 115.

	|133.~  St Gregory differed from st. Dionysius in the
arrangement of the Orders, placing the Principalities in the
second triad, and the Virtues in the third.

	|138.~  St. Paul, who, 2 ^Corinthians~, XII, 4, "was
caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter."
