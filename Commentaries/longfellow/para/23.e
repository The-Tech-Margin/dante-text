	|1.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars continued.  The
Triumph of Christ.

	|3.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, III, 38: --

                           "As the wakeful bird
     Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
     Tunes her nocturnal note."

	|12.~  Towards the meridian, where the sun seems to move
slower than where nearer the horizon.

	|20.~  Didron, ^Christ. Iconog.~, Millington's Tr., I,
308: "The triumph of Christ is, of all subjects, that which has
excited the most enthusiasm amongst artists; it is seen in
numerous monuments, and is represented both in painting and
sculpture, but always with such remarkable midifications as
impart to it the character of a new work.  The eastern portion of
the crypt of the cathedral of Auxerre contains, in the vaulting
of that part which corresponds with the sanctuary, a fresco
painting, executed about the end of the twelfth century, and
representing, in the most simple form imaginable, the triumph of
Christ.  The background of the picture is intersected by a cross,
which, if the transverse branches were a little longer, would be
a perfect Greek cross.  This cross is adorned with imitations of
precious stones, round, oval and lozenge-shaped, disposed in
quincunxes.  In the centre is a figure of Christ, on a white
horse with a saddle; he holds the bridle in his left hand, and in
the right, the hand of power and authority, a black staff, the
rod of iron by which he governs the nations.  He advances thus,
having his head adorned with an azure or bluish nimbus,
intersected by a cross gules; his face is turned towards the
spectator.  In the four compartments formed by the square in
which the cross is enclosed are four angels who form the escort
of Jesus; they are all on horseback, like their master, and with
wings outspread; the right hand of each, which is free, is open
and raised, in token of adoring admiration.  'And I saw heaven
opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was
called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and
make war.  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were
many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he
himself.  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and
his name is called the Word of God.  And the armies which were in
heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen
white and clean`.  Such is the language of the Apocalypse, and
this the fresco at Auxerre interprets, although with some slight
alterations, which it will be well to observe."

	|21.~  By the beneficent influences of the stars.

	|26.~  The Moon.  Trivia is one of the surnames of Diana,
given her because she presided over all the places where three
roads met.

	^Purg.~, XXXI, 106: --

     "We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars."

	^Iliad~, VIII, 550, Anon. Tr.: "As when in heaven the
beauteous stars appear round the bright moon, when the air is
breathless, and all the hills and lofty summits and forests are
visible, and in the sky the boundless ether opens, and all the
stars are seen, and the shepherd is delighted in his soul."

	|29.~  Christ.

	|30.~  The old belief that the stars were fed by the
light of the sun.  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, VII, 364: --

     "Hither as to their fountain other stars
     Repairing, in their golden urns draw light."

	And Calderon, ^El Principe Constante~, sonnet in Jor. II:

     "Those glimmerings of light, those scintillations,
     That by supernal influences draw
     Their nutriment in splendors from th sun."

	|46.~  Beatrice speaks.

	|56.~  The Muse of harmony.

	Skelton, ^Elegy on the Earl of Northumberland~, 155: --

     "If the hole quere of the musis nyne
     In me all onely wer sett and comprisyde,
     Enbreathed with the blast of influence dyvyne,
     And perfightly as could be thought or devysyde;
     To me also allthouche it were promysyde
     Of laureat Phebus holy the eloquence,
     All were to littill for his magnyficence."

	|70.~  Beatrice speaks again.

	|74.~  The Apostles, by following whom the good way was
found.

	Shirley, ^Death's Final Conquest~: --

     "Only the actions of the just
     Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust."

	|78.~  The struggle between his eyes and the light.

	|85.~  Christ, who had re-ascended, so that Dante's eyes,
too feeble to bear the light of his presence, could now behold
the splendor of this "meadow of flowers."

	|88.~  The Rose, of the Virgin Mary, to whom Beatrice
alludes in line 73.  Afterwards he hears the hosts of heaven
repeat her name, as described in line 110: --

     "And all the other lights
     Were making to resound the name of Mary."

	|90.~  This greater fire is also the Virgin, greatest of
the remaining splendors.

	|92.~  ^Stella Maris, Stella Matutina~, are likewise
titles of the Virgin, who surpasses in brightness all other souls
in heaven, as she did here on earth.

	|94.~  The Angel Gabriel.

	|101.~  The mystic virtues of the sapphire are thus
enumerated by Marbodus in his ^Lapidarium~, King's ^Antique
Gems~, p. 395: --

     "By nature with superior honors graced,
     As gem of gems above all others placed;
     Health to preserve and treachery to disarm,
     And guard the wearer from intended harm.
     No envy bends him, and no terror shakes;
     The captive's chains its mighty virtue breaks;
     The gates fly open, fetters fall away,
     And send their prisoner to the light of day.
     E'en Heaven is mov@ed by its force divine
     To list to vows presented at its shrine."

	Sapphire is the color in which the old painters arrayed
the Virgin, "its hue", says Mr. King, "being the exact shade of
the air or atmosphere in the climate of Rome."  This is Dante's

     "Dolce color d'oriental zaffiro",

in ^Purg.~, I, 13.

	|105.~  Haggai, ii, 7: "The desire of all nations shall
come."

infolds all the other volumes or rolling orbs of the universe
like a mantle.

	|115.~  Cowley, ^Hymn to Light~: --

     "Thou Scythian-like dost round thy lands above
     The sun's gilt tent forever move;
     And still as thou in pomp dost go,
     The shining pageants of the world attend thy
     show."

	|120.~  The Virgin ascending to her son. Fray Luis Ponce
de Leon, ^Assumption of the Virgin~: --

     "Lady! thine upward flight
     The opening heavens receive with joyful song;
     Blest who thy mantle bright
     May seize amid the throng,
     And to the sacred mount float peacefully along!
     
     "Bright angels are around thee,
     They that have served thee from thy birth are
     there;
     Their hands with stars have crowned thee;
     Thou, peerless Queen of air,
     As sandals to thy feet the silver moon dost
     wear!

	|128.~  An Easter Hymn to the Virgin: --

     "Regina coeli, laetare!  Alleluia.
     Quia quem meruisti portare, Alleluia.
     Resurrexit, sicut dixit.  Alleluia."

	This hymn, according to Collin de Plancy, ^L@egendes des
Commandements de l'$Eglise~, p. 14, Pope Gregory the Great heard
the angels singing, in the pestilence of Rome in 890, and on
hearing it added another line: --

     "Ora pro nobis Deum!  Alleluia."

	|135.~  Caring not for gold and silver in the Babylonian
exile of this life, they laid up treasures in the other.

     Two massy keys he bore of metals twain,
     (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain)."

And Fletcher, ^Purple Island~, VII, 62: --

     "Not in his lips, but hands, two keys he bore,
     Heaven's doors and Hell's to shut and open
     wide."
