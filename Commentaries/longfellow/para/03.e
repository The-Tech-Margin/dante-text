	|1.~  The Heaven of the Moon continued.  Of the influence
of this planet, Buti, quoting the astrologer Albumasar, says:
"The Moon is cold, moist, and phlegmatic, sometimes warm, and
gives lightness, aptitude in all things, desire of joy, of
beauty, and of praise, beginning of all works, knowledge of the
rich and noble, prosperity in life, acquisition of things
desired, devotion in faith, superior sciences, devotion multitude
of thoughts, necromancy, acuteness of mind in things, geometry,
knowledge of lands and waters and of their measure and number,
weakness of the sentiments, noble women, marriages, pregnancies,
nursings, embassies, falsehoods, accusations; the being lord
among lords, servant among servants, and conformity with every
man of like nature, oblivion thereof, timid, of simple heart,
flattering, honourable towards men, useful to them, not betraying
secrets, a multitude of infirmities and the care of healing
bodies, cutting hair, liberality of food, chastity.  These are
the significations (influences) of the Moon upon the things it
finds, the blame and honour of which, according to the
astrologers, belong to the planet; but the wise man follows the
good influences, and leaves the bad; though all are good and
necessary to the life of the universe."

	|18.~  Narcissus mistook his shadow for a substance;
Dante, falling into the opposite error, mistakes these substances
for shadows.

	|41.~  Your destiny; that is, or yourself and the others
with you.

	|49.~  Piccarda was a sister of Forese and Corsa Donati,
and of Gemma, Dante's wife.  In ^Purg.~ XXIV. 13, Forese says of
her: --

     "My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,
     I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing
     Already in her crown on high Olympus."

	She was a nun of Santa Clara, and was dragged by violence
from the cloister by her brother Corso Donati, who married her to
Rosselin della Tosa.  As she herself says: --

	  "God knows what afterward my life became."

	It was such that she did not live long.  For this crime
the "excellent Baron," according to the ^Ottimo~, had to do
penance in his shirt.

	|70.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, XII. 583: --

                               "Add Love,
     By name to come called Charity, the soul
     Of all the rest."

	|118.~  Constance, daughter of Roger of Sicily.  She was a
nun of Palermo, but was taken from the convent and married to the
Emperor Henry V., son of Barbarossa and father of Frederic II.
Of these "winds of Suabia," or Emperors of the house of Suabia,
Barbarossa was the first, Henry V. the second, and Frederic II.
the third, and, as Dante calls him in the ^Convito~, IV. 3, "the
last of the Roman Emperors," meaning the last of the Suabian
line.
