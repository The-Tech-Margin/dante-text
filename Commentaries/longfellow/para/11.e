	|1.~  The Heaven of the Sun continued.  The praise of St.
Francis by Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican.

	|4.~  Lucretius, ^Nature of Things~, Book II. I, Good's
Tr.: --

     "How sweet to stand, when tempests tear the main,
     On the firm cliff, and mark the seaman's toil!
     Not that another's danger soothes the soul,
     But from such toil how sweet to feel secure!
     How sweet, at distance from the strife, to view
     Contending hosts, and hear the clash of war!
     But sweeter far on Wisdom's heights serene,
     Upheld by Truth, to fix our firm abode;
     To watch the giddy crowd that, deep below,
     Forever wander in pursuit of bliss;
     To mark the strife for honors and renown,
     For wit and wealth, insatiate, ceaseless urged
     Day after day, with labor unrestrained."

	|16.~  Thomas Aquinas.

	|20.~  The spirits see the thoughts of men in God, as in
Canto VIII. 87: --

     "Because I am assured the lofty joy
       Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,
       Where every good thing doth begin and end,
     Thou seest as I see it."

	|25.~  Canto X. 94: --

                  "The holy flock
     Which Dominic conducteth by a road
     Where well one fattens if he strayeth not."

	|26.~  Canto X. 112: --

                              "Where knowledge
     So deep was put, that, if the true be true,
     To see so much there never rose a second."

	|32.~  The Church.  Luke xxiii. 46: "And when Jesus had
cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I
commend my spirit; and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."

	|34.~  ^Romans~ viii. 38: "For I am persuaded, that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

	|35.~  St. Francis and St. Dominic.  Mr. Perkins,
^Tuscan Sculptors~, I. 7, says: "In warring against Frederic,
whose courage, cunning, and ambition gave them ceaseless cause
for alarm, and in strengthening and extending the influence of
the Church, much shaken by the many heresies which had sprung up
in Italy and France, the Popes received invaluable assistance
from the Minorites and the Preaching Friars, whose orders had
been established by Pope Innocent III.  in the early part of the
century, in consequence of a vision, in which he saw the
tottering walls of the Lateran basilica supported by an Italian
and a Spaniard, in whom he afterwards recognized their respective
founders, SS. Francis and Dominic.  Nothing could be more
opposite than the means which these two celebrated men employed
in the work of conversion; for while St. Francis used persuasion
and tenderness to melt the hard-hearted, St. Dominic forced and
crushed them into submission. St. Francis,

                 `La cui mirabil vita
     Meglio in gloria del ciel si canterebbe,' 

was inspired by love for all created things, in the most insignificant
of which he recognized a common origin with himself.  The little lambs
hung up for slaughter excited his pity, and the captive birds his
tender sympathy; the swallows he called his sisters, ^sororculae
meae~, when he begged them to cease their twitterings while he
preached; the worm he carefully removed from his path, lest it should
be trampled on by a less careful foot; and, in love with poverty, he
lived upon the simplest food, went clad in the scantiest garb, and
enjoined chastity and obedience upon his followers, who within four
years numbered no less than fifty thousand; but St. Dominic, though
originally of a kind and compassionate nature, sacrificed whole
hecatombs of victims in his zeal for the Church, showing how far
fanaticism can change the kindest heart, and make it look with
complacency upon deeds which would have formerly excited its
abhorrence."

	|37.~  The Seraphs love most, the Cherubs know most.
Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I. Quaest. cviii. 5, says, in
substance, that the Seraphim are so called from burning;
according to the three properties of fire, namely, continual
motion upward, excess of heat, and of light.  And again, in the
same article, that Cherubim, being interpreted, is plenitude of
knowledge, which in them is fourfold; namely, perfect vision of
God, full reception of divine light, contemplation of beauty in
the order of things, and copious effusion of the divine cognition
upon others.

	|40.~  Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican, here celebrates the
life and deeds of St. Francis, leaving the praise of his own
Saint to Bonaventura, a Franciscan, to show that in heaven there
are no rivalries nor jealousies between the two orders, as there
were on earth.

	|43.~  The town of Ascesi, or Assisi, as it is now called,
where St. Francis was born, is situated between the rivers
Tupino and Chiasi, on the slope of Monte Subaso, where St. Ubald
had his hermitage.  From this mountain the summer heats are
reflected, and the cold winds of winter blow through the Porta
Sole of Perugia.  The towns of Nocera and Gualdo are neighboring
towns, that suffered under the oppression of the Perugians.

	Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, p. 256, says: "Having been
twice at Perugia, I have experienced the double effect of Mount
Ubaldo, which the poet says makes this city feel the cold and
heat.

     `Onde Perugia sente freddo e caldo,' 

that is, which by turns reflects upon it the rays of the sun, and sends
it icy winds.  I have but too well verified the justice of Dante's
observation, particularly as regards the cold temperature, which
Perugia, when it is not burning hot, owes to Mount Ubaldo.  I arrived
in front of this city on a brilliant autumnal night, and had time to
comment at leisure upon the winds of the Ubaldo, as I slowly climbed
the winding road which leads to the gates of the city fortified by a
Pope."

	|50.~  ^Revelation~ vii. 2: "And I saw another angel
ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God."
These words Bonaventura applies to St. Francis, the beautiful
enthusiast and ^Pater Seraphicus~ of the Church, to follow out
whose wonderful life through the details of history and legend
would be too long for these notes.  A few hints must suffice.

	St. Francis was the son of Peter Bernadone, a wool-
merchant of Assisi, and was born in 1182.  The first glimpse we
catch of him is that of a joyous youth in gay apparel, given up
to pleasure, and singing with his companions through the streets
of his native town, like St. Augustine in the streets of
Carthage.  He was in the war between Assisi and Perugia, was
taken prisoner, and passed a year in confinement.  On his return
home a severe illness fell upon him, which gave him more serious
thoughts.  He again appeared in the streets of Assisi in gay
apparel, but meeting a beggar, a fellow-soldier, he changed
clothes with him.  He now began to visit hospitals and kiss the
sores of lepers.  He prayed in the churches, and saw visions.  In
the church of St. Damiano he heard a voice say three times,
"Francis, repair my house, which thou seest falling."  In order
to do this, he sold his father's horse and some cloth at Foligno,
and took the money to the priest of St. Damiano, who to his
credit refused to receive it.  Through fear of his father, he hid
himself; and when he reappeared in the streets was so ill-clad
that the boys pelted him and called him mad.  His father shut him
up in his house; his mother set him free.  In the presence of his
father and the Bishop he renounced all right to his inheritance,
even giving up his clothes, and putting on those of a servant
which the Bishop gave him.  He wandered about the country,
singing the praises of the Lord aloud on the highways.  He met
with a band of robbers, and said to them, "I am the herald of the
Great King."  They beat him and threw him into a ditch filled
with snow.  He only rejoiced and sang the louder.  A friend in
Gubbio gave him a suit of clothes, which he wore for two years,
with a girdle and a staff.  He washed the feet of lepers in the
hospital, and kissed their sores.  He begged from door to door in
Assisi for the repairs of the church of St. Damiano, and carried
stones for the masons.  He did the same for the church of St.
Peter; he did the same for the church of Our Lady of Angels at
Portiuncula, in the neighborhood of Assisi, where he remained two
years.  Hearing one day in church the injunction of Christ to his
Apostles, "Provide neither gold nor silver, nor brass in your
purse, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither
shoes, nor yet staves," he left off shoes and staff and girdle,
and girt himself with a cord, after the manner of the shepherds in that
neighborhood.  This cord became the distinguishing mark of his future
Order.  He kissed the ulcer of a man from Spoleto, and healed him; and
St. Bonaventura says, "I know not which I ought most to admire, such a
kiss or such a cure." Bernard of Quintavalle and others associated
themselves with him, and the Order of the Benedictines was founded.

	As his convent increased, so did his humility and his
austerities.  He sewed his rough habit with pack-thread to make
it rougher; he slept on the ground with a stone for his pillow;
he drank water; he ate bread; he fasted eight lents in the year;
he called his body "Brother Ass," and bound it with a halter, the
cord of his Order; but a few days before his death he begged
pardon of his body for having treated it so harshly.  As a
penance, he rolled himself naked in the snow and among brambles;
he commanded his friars to revile him, and when he said, "O
Brother Francis, for thy sins thou hast deserved to be plunged
into hell"; Brother Leo was to answer, "It is true; thou hast
deserved to be buried in the very bottom of hell."

	In 1215 his convent was removed to Alvernia, among the
solitudes of the Apennines.  In 1219 he went to Egypt to convert
the Sultan, and preached to him in his camp near Damietta, but
without the desired effect.  He returned to the duties of his
convent with unabated zeal; and was sometimes seen by his
followers lifted from the ground by the fervor of his prayers;
and here he received in a vision of the Crucifixion the
^stigmata~ in his hands and feet and side.  Butler, ^Lives of the
Saints~, X. 100, says: "The marks of nails began to appear on his
hands and feet, resembling those he had seen in the vision of the
man crucified.  His hands and feet seemed bored through in the
middle with four wounds, and these holes appeared to be pierced
with nails of hard flesh; the heads were round and black, and
were seen in the palms of his hands, and in his feet in the upper
part of the instep.  The points were long, and appeared beyond
the skin on the other side, and were turned back as if they had
been clenched with a hammer.  There was also in his right side a
red wound, as if made by the piercing of a lance; and this often
threw out blood, which stained the tunic and drawers of the
saint."

	Two years afterwards St. Francis died, exclaiming,
"Welcome, Sister Death"; and multitudes came to kiss his sacred
wounds.  His body was buried in the church of St. George at
Assisi, but four years afterwards removed to a church outside the
walls.  See Note 117 of this canto.

	In the life of St. Francis it is sometimes difficult to
distinguish between the facts of history and the myths of
tradition; but through all we see the outlines of a gentle,
beautiful, and noble character.  All living creatures were his
brothers and sisters.  To him the lark was an emblem of the Cherubim,
and the lamb an image of the Lamb of God.  He is said to have preached
to the birds; and his sermon was, "Brother birds, greatly are ye bound
to praise the Creator, who clotheth you with feathers, and giveth you
wings to fly with, and a purer air to breathe, and who careth for you,
who have so little care for yourselves."

	Forsyth, describing his visit to La Verna, ^Italy~, p.
123, says: "Francis appears to me a genuine hero, original,
independent, magnanimous, incorruptible.  His powers seemed
designed to regenerate society; but, taking a wrong direction,
they sank men into beggars."

	Finally, the phrase he often uttered when others praised
him may be here repeated, "What every one is in the eyes of God,
that he is and no more."

	|51.~  Namely, in winter, when the sun is far south; or,
as Biagioli prefers, glowing with unwonted splendor.

	|53.~  It will be noticed that there is a play of words on
the name Ascesi (I ascended), which Padre Venturi irreverently
calls a ^concetto di tre quattrini.~

	|59.~  His vow of poverty, in opposition to the wishes of
his father.

	|61.~  In the presence of his father and of the Bishop of
the diocese.

	|65.~  After the death of Christ, she waited eleven
hundred years and more till St. Francis came.

	|67.~  The story of Caesar's waking the fisherman
Amyclas to take him across the Adriatic is told by Lucan,
^Pharsalia~, V.: --

      "There through the gloom his searching eyes explored,
     Where to the mouldering rock a bark was moored.
     The mighty master of this little boat
     Securely slept within a neighboring cot:
     No massy beams support his humble hall,
     But reeds and marshy rushes wove the wall;
     Old, shattered planking for a roof was spread,
     And covered in from rain the needy shed.
     Thrice on the feeble door the warrior struck,
     Beneath the blow the trembling dwelling shook.
     `What wretch forlorn,' the poor Amyclas cries,
     `Driven by the raging seas, and stormy skies,
     To my poor lowly roof for shelter flies?'

      "O happy poverty! thou greatest good,
     Bestowed by Heaven, but seldom understood!
     Here nor the cruel spoiler seeks his prey,
     Nor ruthless armies take their dreadful way:
     Security thy narrow limits keeps,
     Safe are thy cottages, and sound thy sleeps.
     Behold! ye dangerous dwellings of the great,
     Where gods and godlike princes choose their seat;
     See in what peace the poor Amyclas lies,
     Nor starts, though Caesar's call commands to rise."

	Dante also writes, ^Convito~, IV. 13: "And therefore the
wise man says, that the traveller empty-handed on his way would
sing in the very presence of robbers.  And that is what Lucan
refers to in his fifth book, when he commends the security of
poverty, saying: O safe condition of poverty!  O narrow
habitations and hovels!  O riches of the Gods not yet understood!
At what times and at what walls could it happen, the not being
afraid of any noise, when the hand of Caesar was knocking?  And
this says Lucan, when he describes how Caesar came by night to
the hut of the fisherman Amyclas, to pass the Adrian Sea."

	|74.~  St. Francis, according to Butler, ^Lives of the
Saints~, X. 78, used to say that "he possessed nothing of earthly
goods, being a disciple of Him who, for our sakes, was born a stranger
in an open stable, lived without a place of his own wherein to lay his
head, subsisting by the charity of good people, and died naked on a
cross in the close embraces of holy poverty."

	|79.~  Bernard of Quintavalle, the first follower of St.
Francis.  Butler, ^Lives of the Saints~, X. 75, says: "Many began to
admire the heroic and uniform virtue of this great servant of God, and
some desired to be his companions and disciples.  The first of these
was Bernard of Quintaval, a rich tradesman of Assisium, a person of
singular prudence, and of great authority in that city, which had been
long directed by his counsels.  Seeing the extraordinary conduct of St.
Francis, he invited him to sup at his house, and had a good bed made
ready for him near his own.  When Bernard seemed to be fallen asleep,
the servant of God arose, and falling on his knees, with his eyes
lifted up, and his arms across, repeated very slow, with abundance of
tears, the whole night, ^Deus meus et Omnia~, `My God and my All'.....
Bernard secretly watched the saint all night, by the light of a lamp,
saying to himself, `This man is truly a servant of God'; and admiring
the happiness of such a one, whose heart is entirely filled with God,
and to whom the whole world is nothing.  After many other proofs of the
sincere and admirable sanctity of Francis, being charmed and vanquished
by his example, he begged the saint to make him his companion.  Francis
recommended the matter to God for some time; they both heard mass
together, and took advice that they might learn the will of God.  The
design being approved, Bernard sold all his effects, and divided the
sum among the poor in one day."

	|83.~  Giles, or Egidius, the second follower of St.
Francis, died at Perugia, in 1272.  He was the author of a book
called ^Verba Aurea~, Golden Words.  Butler, ^Lives of the
Saints~, VII. 162, note, says of him: "None among the first
disciples of St. Francis seems to have been more perfectly
replenished with his spirit of perfect charity, humility,
meekness, and simplicity, as appears from the golden maxims and
lessons of piety which he gave to others."

	He gives also this anecdote of him on p. 164: "Brother
Giles said, `Can a dull idiot love God as perfectly as a great
scholar?'  St. Bonaventure replied, `A poor old woman may love him more
than the most learned master and doctor in theology.' At this Brother
Giles, in a sudden fervor and jubilation of spirit, went into a garden,
and, standing at a gate toward the city (of Rome), he looked that way,
and cried out with a loud voice, `Come, the poorest, most simple, and
most illiterate old woman, love the Lord our God, and you may attain to
an higher degree of eminence and happiness than Brother Bonaventure
with all his learning.'  After this he fell into an ecstasy, in which he
continued in sweet contemplation without motion for the space of three
hours."

	Sylvester, the third disciple, was a priest who sold
stone to St. Francis for the repairs of the church of St. Damiano.
Some question arising about the payment, St. Francis thrust his
hand into Bernard's bosom and drew forth a handful of gold, which
he added to the previous payment.  Sylvester, smitten with
remorse that he, an old man, should be so greedy of gold, while a
young man despised it for the love of God, soon after became a
disciple of the saint.

	|89.~  Peter Bernadone, the father of St. Francis, was a
wool-merchant.  Of this humble origin the saint was not ashamed.

	|93.~  The permission to establish his religious Order,
granted by Pope Innocent III., in 1214.

	|96.~  Better here in heaven by the Angels, than on earth
by Franciscan friars in their churches, as the custom was.  Or
perhaps, as Buti interprets it, better above in the glory of
Paradise, "where is the College of all the Saints," than here in
the Sun.

	|98.~  The permission to found the Order of Minor Friars,
or Franciscans, granted by Pope Innocent III., in 1214, was
confirmed by Pope Honorius III., in 1223.

	|99.~  The title of Archimandrite, or Patriarch, was given
in the Greek Church to one who had supervision over many
convents.

	|101.~  Namely, before the Sultan of Egypt in his camp
near Damietta.

	|104.~  In the words of Ben Jonson,

     "Potential merit stands for actual,
     Where only opportunity doth want,
     Not will nor power." 

	|106.~  On Mount Alvernia, St. Francis, absorbed in
prayer, received in his hands and feet and breast the ^stigmata~
of Christ, that is, the wounds of the nails and the spear of the
crucifixion, the final seal of the Order.

	Forsyth, ^Italy~, p. 122: "This singular convent, which
stands on the cliffs of a lofty Apennine, was built by St.
Francis himself, and is celebrated for the miracle which the
motto records.  Here reigns all the terrible of nature, -- a
rocky mountain, a ruin of the elements, broken, sawn, and piled
in sublime confusion, -- precipices crowned with old, gloomy,
visionary woods, -- black chasms in the rock where curiosity
shudders to look down, -- haunted caverns, sanctified by
miraculous crosses, -- long excavated stairs that restore you to
daylight.....  On entering the Chapel of the Stigmata, we caught
the religion of the place; we knelt round the rail, and gazed
with a kind of local devotion at the holy spot where St. Francis
received the five wounds of Christ.  The whole hill is legendary
ground.  Here the Seraphic Father was saluted by two crows which
still haunt the convent; there the Devil hurled him down a
precipice, yet was not permitted to bruise a bone of him."

	|117.~  When St. Francis was dying, he desired to be
buried among the malefactors at the place of execution, called the
^Colle d'Inferno~, or Hill of Hell.  A church was afterwards built on
this spot; its name was changed to ^Colle di Paradiso~, and the body of
the saint transferred thither in 1230.  The popular tradition is, that
it is standing upright under the principal altar of the chapel devoted
to the saint.

	|118.~  If St. Francis were as here described, what must
his companion, St. Dominic, have been, who was Patriarch, or
founder, of the Order to which Thomas Aquinas belonged.  To the
degeneracy of this Order the remainder of the canto is devoted.

	|137.~  The Order of the Dominicans diminished in numbers,
by its members going in search of prelacies and other
ecclesiastical offices, till it is like a tree hacked and hewn.

	|138.~  Buti interprets this passage differently.  He
says: "|Vedrai 'l corregger~; that is, thou, Dante, shalt see St.
Dominic, whom he calls |corregger~, because he wore about his
waist the ^correggia~, or leathern thong, and made his friars
wear it, as St. Francis made his wear the cord; -- |che
argomenta~, that is, who proves by true arguments in his
constitutions, that his friars ought to study sacred theology,
studying which their souls will grow fat with a good fatness;
that is, with the grace of God, and the knowledge of things
divine, if they do not go astray after the other sciences, which
are vanity, and make the soul vain and proud."
