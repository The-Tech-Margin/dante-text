	|1.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars continued.  St. Peter
examines Dante on Faith.

	^Revelation~, xix, 9: "And he saith unto me, Write,
Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage-supper of the
Lamb."

	|16.~  The carol was a dance as well as a song; or, to
speak more exactly, a dance accompanied by a song.

	Gower, ^Confes. Amant.~, VI: --

     "And if it nedes so betide,
     That I in company abide,
     Where as I must daunce and singe
     The hove and carolinge."

	It is from the old French ^karole.~  See passage from the
^Roman de la Rose~, in Note 118 of this canto.  See also
Roquefort, ^Glossaire~: "Karole, dance, concert, divertissement;
de ^chorea, chorus~"; and "Karoler, sauter, danser, se divertir.

     Et li borj$eois y furent en present
     ^Karolent~ main @a main, et chantent hautement.
     ^Vie de Du Guesclin.~"

Milton, ^Par. lost~, V, 618: --

     "That day, as other solemn days, they spent
     In song and dance about the sacred hill,
     Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere
     Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
     Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
     Eccentric, intervolved yet regular
     Then most when most irregular they seem;
     And in their motions harmony divine
     So smooths her charming tones, that God's
     own ear
     Listens delighted."

	|17.~  "That is", says Buti, "of the abundance of their
beatitude...  And this swiftness and slowness signified the
fervor of love which was in them."

	|19.~  From the brightest of these carols or dances.

	|20.~  St. Peter.

	|22.~  Three times, in sign of the Trinity.

	|27.~  Tints too coarse and glaring to paint such
delicate draperies of song.

	|28.~  St. Peter speaks to Beatrice.

	|41.~  Fixed upon God, in whom all things are reflected.

	|59.~  The captain of the first cohort of the Church
Militant.

	|62.~  St. Paul.  Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary
Art~, I, 159, says: "The early Christian Church was always
considered under two great divisions: the church of the converted
Jews, and the church of the Gentiles.  The first was represented
by St. Peter, the second by St. Paul.  Standing together in this
mutual relation, they represent the universal church of Christ;
hence in works of art they are seldom separated, and are
indispensable in all ecclesiastical decoration. Their proper
place is on each side of the Saviour, or of the Virgin throned;
or on each side of the altar; or on each side of the arch over
the choir.  In any case, where they stand together, not merely as
Apostles, but Founders, their place is next after the Evangelists
and the Prophets."

	|64.~  ^Hebrews~, xi, I: "Now faith is the substance of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

	|66.~  In Scholastic language the essence of a thing,
distinguishing it from all other things, is called its
^quiddity~; in answer to the question, ^Quid est~?

	|78.~  Jeremy Taylor says: "Faith is a certain image of
eternity; all things are present to it; things past and things to
come are all so before the eyes of faith, that he in whose eye
that candle is enkindled beholds heaven as present, and sees how
blessed a thing it is to die in God's favor, and to be chimed to
our grave with the music of a good conscience.  Faith converses
with the angels, and antedates the hymns of glory; every man that
hath this grace is as certain that there are glories for him, if
he perseveres in duty, as if he had heard and sung the
thanksgiving song for the blessed sentence of doomsday."

	|87.~  "The purified, righteous man", says Tertullian,
"has become a coin of the Lord, and has the impress of his King
stamped upon him."

	|93.~  The Old and New Testaments.

	|115.~  In the Middle Ages titles of nobility were given
to the saints and to other renowned personages of sacred history. 
Thus Boccaccio, in his story of Fra Cipolla, ^Decamerone~, Gior.
VI, Nov. 10, speaks of the Baron Messer Santo Antonio; and in
Juan Lorenzo's ^Poema de Alexandro~, we have Don Job, Don
Bacchus, and Don Satan.

	|118.~  The word |donnea~, which I have rendered "like a
lover plays", is from the Proven$cal ^domnear.~  In its old French
form, ^dosnoier~, it occurs in some editions of the ^Roman de la
Rose~, line 1305: --

     "Les karoles j@a remanoient;
     Car tuit li plusors s'en aloient
     O leurs amies umbroier
     Sous ces arbres pour dosnoier."

Chaucer translates the passage thus: --

     "The daunces then ended ywere;
     For many of hem that daunced there
     Were, with hir loves, went away
     Under the trees to have hir play."

	The word expresses the gallantry of the knight towards
his lady.

	|126.~  St John was the first to reach the sepulchre, but
St. Peter the first to enter it.  ^John~, xx, 4: "So they ran
both together; and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came
first to the sepulchre.  And he, stooping down, and looking in,
saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh
Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth
the linen clothes lie."

	|132.~  Dante, ^Convito~, II, 4, speaking of the motion
of the ^Primum Mobile~, or Crystalline Heaven, which moves all
the others, says: "From the fervent longing which each part of
that ninth heaven has to be conjoined with that Divinest Heaven,
the Heaven of Rest, which is next to it, it revolves therein with
so great desire, that its velocity is almost incomprehensible."

	|137.~  St. Peter and the other Apostles after Pentecost.

	|141.~  Both three and one, both plural and singular.

	|152.~  Again the sign of the Trinity.
