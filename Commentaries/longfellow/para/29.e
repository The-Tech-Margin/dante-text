	|1.~  The ^Primum Mobile~, or Crystalline Heaven,
continued.

	The children of Latona are Apollo and Diana, the Sun and
Moon.

	|2.~  When the Sun is in Aries and the Moon in Libra, and
when the Sun is setting and the full Moon rising, so that they
are both on the horizon at the same time.

	|3.~  So long as they remained thus equipoised, as if in
the opposite scales of an invisible balance suspended from the
zenith.

	|9.~  God, whom Dante could not look upon, even as
reflected in the eyes of Beatrice.

	|11.~  What Dante wishes to know is, where, when, and how
the Angels were created.

	|12.~  Every When and every Where.

	|14.~  Dante, ^Convito~, III, 14, defines splendor as
"reflected light."  Here it means the creation; the reflected
light of God.

	^Job~, xxxviii, 7: "When the morning stars sang together,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy."  And again, 35: "Canst
thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here
we are?"

	|16.~  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I Quaest., LXI, 3:
"The angelic nature was made before the creation of time, and
after eternity."

	|18.~  In the creation of the Angels.  Some editions read
^nove Amori~, the nine Loves, or nine choirs of Angels.

	|21.~  ^Genesis~, i, 2: "And the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters."

	|22.~  Pure Matter, or the elements; pure Form, or the
Angels; and the two conjoined, the human race.

	Form, in the language of the Schools, and as defined by
Thomas Aquinas, is the principle "by which we first think,
whether it be called intellect, or intellectual soul."  See Canto
IV, Note 54.

	|23.~  ^Genesis~, i, 31: "And God saw everything that he
had made, and, behold, it was very good."

	|33.~  The Angels.  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I
Quaest. L, 2, says: "Form is act.  Therefore whatever is form
alone, is pure act."  For his definition of form, see Note 22.

	|34.~  Pure matter, which is passive and only possesses
potentiality, or power of assuming various forms when united with
mind."  It is called potentiality", comments Buti, "because it
can receive many forms; and the forms are called act, because
they change, and act by changing matter into various forms."

	|35.~  The union of the soul and body in man, who
occupies the intermediate place between Angels and pure matter.

	|36.~  This bond, though suspended by death, will be
resumed again at the resurrection, and remain forever.

	|37.~  St. Jerome, the greatest of the Latin Fathers of
the Church, and author of the translation of the Scriptures known
as the ^Vulgate~, was born of wealthy parents in Dalmatia, in
342.  He studied at Rome under the grammarian Donatus, and became
a lawyer in that city.  At the age of thirty he visited the Holy
Land, and, withdrawing from the world, became an anchorite in the
desert of Chalcida, on the borders of Arabia.  Here he underwent
the bodily privations and temptations, and enjoyed the spiritual
triumphs, of the hermit's life.  He was "haunted by demons, and
consoled by voices and visions from heaven."  In one of his
letters, cited by Butler, ^Lives of the Saints~, IX, 362, he
writes: "In the remotest part of a wild and sharp desert, which,
being burnt up with the heats of the scorching sun, strikes with
horror and terror even the monks that inhabit it, I seemed to
myself to be in the midst of the delights and assemblies of Rome. 
I loved solitude, that in the bitterness of my soul I might more
freely bewail my miseries, and call upon my Saviour.  My hideous
emaciated limbs were covered with sack-cloth: my skin was parched
dry and black, and my flesh was almost wasted away.  The days I
passed in tears and groans, and when sleep overpowered me against
my will, I cast my wearied bones, which hardly hung together,
upon the bare ground, not so properly to give them rest, as to
torture myself.  I say nothing of my eating and drinking; for the
monks in that desert, when they are sick, know no other drink but
cold water, and look upon it as sensuality ever to eat anything
dressed by fire.  In this exile and prison, to which, for the
fear of hell, I had voluntarily condemned myself, having no other
company but scorpions and wild beasts, I many times found my
imagination filled with lively representations of dances in the
company of Roman ladies, as if I had been in the midst of them... 
I often joined whole nights to the days, crying, sighing, and
beating my breast till the desired calm returned.  I feared the
very cell in which I lived, because it was witness to the foul
suggestions of my enemy; and being angry and armed with severity
against myself, I went alone into the most secret parts of the
wilderness, and if I discovered anywhere a deep valley, or craggy
rock, that was the place of my prayer, there I threw this
miserable sack of my body.  The same Lord is my witness, that
after so many sobs and tears, after having in much sorrow looked
long up to heaven, I felt most delightful comforts and interior
sweetness; and these so great, that, transported and absorpt, I
seemed to myself to be amidst the choirs of angels; and glad and
joyful I sung to God: ^After Thee, O Lord, we will run in the
fragrancy of thy celestial ointments.~"

	In another letter, cited by Montalembert, ^Monks of the
West~, Auth. Tr., I, 404, he exclaims: "O desert, enamelled with
the flowers of Christ!  O solitude, where those stones are born
of which, in the Apocalypse, is built the city of the Great King! 
O retreat, which rejoicest in the friendship of God!  What doest
thou in the world, my brother, with thy soul greater than the
world?  How long wilt thou remain in the shadow of roofs, and in
the smoky dungeons of cities?  Believe me, I see here more of the
light."

	At the end of five years he was driven from his solitude
by the persecution of the Eastern monks; and lived successively
in Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, Rome, and Alexandria. 
Finally, in 385, he returned to the Holy Land, and built a
monastery at Bethlehem.  Here he wrote his translation of the
Scriptures, and his Lives of the Fathers of the Desert; but in
416 this monastery, and others that had risen up in its
neighborhood, were burned by the Pelagians, and St. Jerome took
refuge in a strong tower of fortified castle.  Four years
afterwards he died, and was buried in the ruins of his monastery.

	|40.~  This truth of the simultaneous creation of mind
and matter, as stated in line 29.

	|41.~  The opinion of St. Jerome and other Fathers of the
Church, that the Angels were created long ages before the rest of
the universe, is refuted by Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I
Quaest., LXI, 3.

	|45.~  That the Intelligences or Motors of the heavens
should be so long without any heavens to move.

	|51.~  The subject of the elements is the earth, so
called as being the lowest, or underlying the others, fire, air,
and water.

	|56.~  The pride of Lucifer, who lies at the centre of
the earth, towards which all things gravitate, and

     "Down upon which thrust all the other rocks."

	Milton, ^Par. Lost~, V, 856, makes the rebel angels deny
that they were created by God: --

                                      "Who saw
     When this creation was?  Rememberest thou
     Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
     We know no time when we were not as now;
     Know none before us; self-begot, self-raised
     By our own quickening power, when fatal course
     Had circled his full orb, the birth mature
     Of this our native heaven, ethereal sons."

	|65.~  The merit consists in being willing to receive
this grace.

	|95.~  St. Chrysostom, who in his preaching so carried
away his audiences that they beat the pavement with their swords
and called him the "Thirteenth Apostle", in one of his ^Homilies~
thus upbraids the custom of applauding the preacher: "What do
your praises advantage me, when I see not your progress in
virtue?  Or what harm shall I receive from the silence of my
auditors, when I behold the increase of their piety?  The praise
of the speaker is not the acclamation of his hearers, but their
zeal for piety and religion; not their making a great stir in the
times of hearing, but their showing diligence at all other times. 
Applause, as soon as it is out of the mouth, is dispersed into
the air, and vanishes; but when the hearers grow better, this
brings an incorruptible and immortal reward both to the speaker
and the hearer.  The praise of your acclamation may render the
orator more illustrious here, but the piety of your souls will
give him greater confidence before the tribunal of Christ. 
Therefore, if any on love the preacher, or if any preacher love
his people, let him not be enamored with applause, but with the
benefit of the hearers."

	|103.~  Lapo is the abbreviation of Jacopo, and Bindi of
Aldobrandi, both familiar names in Florence.

	|107.~  Milton, ^Lycidas~, 113: --

     "How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,
     Enow of such as for their bellies' sake
     Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!
     Of other care they little reckoning make,
     Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,
     And shove away the worthy bidden guest!
     Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
     A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least
     That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
     What recks it them?  What need they?  They are sped;
     And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs
     Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw:
     The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed;
     But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,
     Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:
     Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
     Daily devours apace, and nothing said:
     But that two-handed engine at the door
     Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more."

	|115.~  Cowper, ^Task~, II: --

     "He that negotiates between God and man,
     As God's ambassador, the grand concerns
     Of judgment and of mercy, should beware
     Of lightness in his speech.  'T is pitiful
     To court a grin, when you should woo a soul;
     To break a jest, when pity would inspire
     Pathetic exhortation; and t'address
     The skittish fancy with facetious tales,
     When sent with God's commission to the heart!"

	For a specimen of the style of popular preachers in the
Middle Ages, see the story of Frate Cipolla, in the ^Decamerone~,
Gior. VI, Nov. 10.  See also Scheible's ^Kloster~, and Menin's
^Pr$edicatoriana.~

	|118.~  The Devil, who is often represented in early
Christian art under the shape of coal-black bird.  See Didron,
^Christ. Iconog.~, I.

	|124.~  In early paintings the swine is the symbol of St.
Anthony, as the cherub is of St. Matthew, the lion of St. Mark,
and the eagle of St. John.  There is an old tradition that St.
Anthony was once a swineherd.  Brand, ^Pop. Antiquities~, I, 358,
says: --

	"In the World of Wonders is the following translation of
an epigram: --

     'Once fed'st thou, Anthony, an heard of swine,
     And now an heard of monkes thou feedest still:
     For wit and gut, alike both charges bin:
     Both loven filth alike; both like to fill
     Their greedy paunch alike.  Nor was the kind
     More beastly, sottish, swinish than this last.
     All else agrees: one fault I onely find,
     Thou feedest not thy monkes with oken
     mast`.

	"The author mentions before, persons 'who runne up and
downe the country, crying, Have you anything to bestow upon my
lord S. Anthonie's swine`?"

	Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary art~, II, 380,
remarks: "I have read somewhere that the hog is given to St.
Anthony, because he had been a swineherd, and cured the diseases
of swine.  This is quite a mistake.  The hog was the
representative of the demon of sensulity and gluttony, which
Anthony is supposed to have vanquished by the exercises of piety
and by divine aid.  The ancient custom of placing in all his
effigies a black pig at his feet, or under his feet, gave rise to
the superstition that this unclean animal was especially
dedicated to him, and under his protection. The monks of the
Order of St. Anthony kept herds of consecrated pigs, which were
allowed to feed at the public charge, and which it was a
profanation to steal or kill: hence the proverb about the fatness
of a 'Tantony pig`."

	Halliwell, ^Dict. of Arch. and Prov. Words~, has the
following definition: "Anthony -- Pig.  The favorite or smallest
pig of the litter.  A Kentish expression, according to Grose. 
'To follow like a tantony pig`, i.e. to follow close at one's
heels.  Some derive this saying from a privilege enjoyed by the
friars of certain convents in England and France, sons of St.
Anthony, whose swine were permitted to feed in the streets. 
These swine would follow any one having greens or other
provisions, till they obtained some of them; and it was in those
days considered an act of charity and religion to feed them.  St.
Anthony was invoked for the pig."

	Mr. Howells, ^Venetian Life~, p. 341, alludes to the same
custom as once prevalent in Italy: "Among other priveleges of the
Church, abolished in Venice long ago, was the ancient right of
the monks of St. Anthony Abbot, by which their herds of swine
were made free of the whole city.  These animals, enveloped in an
odor of sanctity, wandered here and there, and were piously fed
by devout people, until the year 1409, when, being found
dangerous to children, and incovenient to everybody, they were
made the subject of a special decree, which deprived them of
their freedom of movement.  The Republic was always opposing and
limiting the privileges of the Church!"

	|126.~  Giving false indulgences, without the true stamp
upon them, in return for the alms received.

	|130.~  The nature of the Angels.

	|134.~  ^Daniel~, vii, 10: "Thousand thousands ministered
unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him."

	|136.~  That irradiates this angelic nature.

	|138.~  The splendors are the reflected lights, or the
Angels.

	|140.~  The fervor of the Angels is proportioned to their
capacity of receiving the divine light.
