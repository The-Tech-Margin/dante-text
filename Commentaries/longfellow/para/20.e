	|1.~  The Heaven of Jupiter continued.

	|3.~  Coleridge, ^Ancient Mariner~: --

     The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;
     At one stride comes the dark."

	|5.~  Blanco White, ^Night~: --

     Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew
     Thee, from report divine, and heard thy name,
     Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
     This glorious canopy of light and blue?
     Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,
     Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,
     Hesperus with the host of heaven came,
     And lo! creation widened in man's view.
     Who could have thought such darkness lay
     concealed
     Within thy beams, O sun! or who could
     find,
     Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,
     That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us
     blind?
     Why do we,then, shun death with anxious
     strife?
     If Light can thus deceive, wherefore not
     Life?"

	|37.~  King David, who carrid the Ark of the Covenant
from Kirjathjearim to the house of Obed-Edom, and thence to
Jerusalem.  See 2 ^Samuel~, vi.

	|41.~  In so far as the Psalms were the result of his own
free will, and not of divine inspiration.  As in Canto VI, 118:

     But in commensuration of our wages
     With our desert is portion of our joy,
     Because we see them neither less nor
     greater."

	|44.~  The Emperor Trajan, whose soul was saved by the
prayers of St. Gregory.  For the story of the poor widow, see
^Purg.~, X, 73, and note.

	|49.~  King Hezekiah.

	|51.~  2 ^Kings~, xx, 11: "And Isaiah the prophet cried
unto the Lord; and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by
which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz."

	|55.~  Constantine, who transferred the seat of empire,
the Roman laws, and the Roman standard to Byzantium, thus in a
poetic sense becoming a Greek.

	|56.~  This refers to the supposed gift of Constantine to
Pope Sylvester, Known in ecclesiastical history as the patrimony
of Saint Peter.  ^Inf.~, XXI, 115: --

     "Ah, Constantine! of how much woe was
     mother,
     Not thy conversion, but that marriagedower
     Which the first wealthy Father took from
     thee!"

See also the note.

	|62.~  William the Second, surnamed the Good, son of
Robert Guiscard, and King of Apulia and Sicily, which Kingdoms
were then lamenting the living presence of such kings as Charles
the Lame, "the Cripple of Jerusalem", king of Apulia, and
Frederick of Aragon, king of Sicily.

	"King Guilielmo", says the ^Ottimo~, "was just and
reasonable, loved his subjects, and kept them in such peace, that
living in Sicily might then be esteemed living in a terrestrial
paradise.  He was liberal to all, and proportioned his bounties
to the virtue [of the receiver].  And he had this rule, that if a
vicious or evil-speaking courtier came to his court, he was
immediately noticed by the masters of ceremony, and provided with
gifts and robes, so that he might have a cause to depart.  If he
was wise, he departed; if not, he was politely dismissed."  The
Vicar of Wakefield seems to have followed the example of the good
King William, for he says: "When any one of our relations was
found to be a person of very bad character, a troublesome guest,
or one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house I ever
took care to lend him a riding-coat, or a pair of boots, or
sometimes a horse of small value, and I always had the
satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them."

	|68.~  A Trojan hero slain at the sack of Troy. 
^Aeneid~, II, 426: "Ripheus also falls, the most just among the
Trojans, and most observant of the right."

	Venturi thinks that, if Dante must needs introduce a
Pagan into Paradise, he would have done better to have chosen
Aeneas, who was the hero of his master, Virgil, and, moreover,
the founder of the Roman empire.

	|73.~  The word "expatiate" is here used in the sense
given it by Milton in the following passage, ^Par. Lost~, I, 768:

                                          "As bees,
     In spring-time when the sun with Taurus rides,
     Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
     In clusters; they, among fresh dews and flowers,
     Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,
     The suburb of their straw-built citadel,
     New rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer
     Their state-affairs."

	Landor, ^Pentameron~, p. 92, says: "All the verses that
ever were written on the nightingale are scarcely worth the
beautiful triad of this divine poet on the lark.  In the first of
them, do not you see the twinkling of her wings against the sky? 
As often as I repeat them, my ear is satisfied, my heart (like
hers) contented."

	|92.~  In scholastic language the quiddity of a thing is
its essence, or that by which it is what it is.

	|94.~  ^Matthew~, xi, 12: "And from the days of John the
Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and
the violent take it by force."

	|100.~  Trajan and Ripheus.

	|105.~  Ripheus lived before Christ, and Trajan after.

	Shakespeare, ^King Henry IV~, I, 1: --

     "In those holy fields
     Over whose acres walked those blessed feet,
     Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed,
     For our advantage, on the bitter cross."

	|106.~  Trajan.

	|111.~  Being in hell, he could not repent; being
resuscitated, his inclinations could turn towards good.

	|112.~  The legend of Trajan is, that by the prayers of
St. Gregory the Great he was restored to life, after he had been
dead four hundred years; that he lived long enough to be
baptized, and was then received into Paradise.  See ^Purg.~, X,
Note 73.

	|118.~  Ripheus.  "This is a fiction of our author", says
Buti, "as the intelligent reader may imagine; for there is no
proof that Ripheus the Trojan is saved."

	|127.~  Faith, Hope, and Charity.  ^Purg.~, XXIX, 121: --

     "Three ladies at the right wheel in a circle
     Came onward dancing; one so very red
     That in the fire she hardly had been noted
     The second was as if her flesh and bones
     Had all been fashioned out of emerald;
     The third appeared as snow but newly
     fallen."

	|130.~  ^Romans~, ix, 20: "Nay but, O man, who art thou
that repliest against God?  Shall the thing formed say to him
that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  Had not the potter
power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honor, and another unto dishonor?"
