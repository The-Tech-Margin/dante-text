	|1.~  "Hosanna, holy God of Sabaoth, illuminating with thy
brightness the happy fires of these realms."

	Dante is still in the planet Mercury, which receives from
the sun six times more light and heat than the Earth.

	|5.~  By Substance is here meant spirit, or angel; the
word having the sense of Subsistence.  See Canto XXIII. Note 58.

	|7.~  The rapidity of the motion of the flying spirits is
beautifully expressed in these lines.

	|10.~  Namely, the doubt in his mind.

	|14.~  Bice, or Beatrice.

	|17.~  ^Convito~ III. 8: "And in these two places I say
these pleasures appear, saying, ^In her eyes and in her sweet
smile~; which two places by a beautiful similitude may be called
balconies of the Lady who inhabits the edifice of the body, that
is, the Soul; since here, although as if veiled, she often shows
herself.  She shows herself in the eyes so manifestly, that he
who looks carefully can recognize her present passion.  Hence,
inasmuch as six passions are peculiar to the human soul, of which
the Philosopher makes mention in his Rhetoric, that is, grace,
zeal, mercy, envy, love, and shame, with none of these can the
Soul be impassioned, without its semblance coming to the window
of the eyes, unless it be kept within by great effort.  Hence one
of old plucked out his eyes, so that his inward shame might not
appear outwardly, as Statius the poet relates of Theban
OEdipus, when he says, that in eternal night he hid his shame
accursed.  She shows herself in the mouth, as color behind glass.
And what is laughter but a coruscation of the delight of the
soul, that is, a light appearing outwardly, as it exists within?
And therefore it behoveth man to show his soul in moderate joy,
to laugh moderately with dignified severity, and with slight
motion of the arms; so that the Lady who then shows herself, as
has been said, may appear modest, and not dissolute.  Hence the
Book of the Four Cardinal Virtues commands us, `Let thy laughter
be without cachinnation, that is to say, without cackling like a
hen.'  Ah, wonderful laughter of my Lady, that never was perceived
but by the eye!"

	|20.~  Referring back to Canto VI.  92; --

                    "To do vengeance
     Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin."

	|27.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, I. 1, the story

	  "Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit
	  Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
	  Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
	  With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
	  Restore us, and regain the blissful seat."

	|36.~  Sincere in the sense of pure.

	|65.~  Plato, ^Timaeus~, Davis's Tr., X.: "Let us
declare then on what account the framing Artificer settled the
formation of this universe.  He was good; and in the good envy is
never engendered about anything whatever.  Hence, being free from
this, he desired that all things should as much as possible
resemble himself."

	Also Milton, ^Par.  Lost~ I. 259: --

         "The Almighty hath not built
     Here for his envy."

And again, VIII, 491: --

                 "Thou hast fulfilled
     Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,
     Giver of all things fair! but fairest this
     Of all thy gifts! nor enviest."

	|67.~  Dante here discriminates between the direct or
immediate inspirations of God, and those influences that come
indirectly through the stars.  In the ^Convito~, VII. 3, he says:
"The goodness of God is received in one manner by disembodied
substances, that is, by the Angels (who are without material
grossness, and as it were diaphanous on account of the purity of
their form), and in another manner by the human soul, which
though in one part it is free from matter, in another is impeded
by it; (as a man who is wholly in the water, except his head, of
whom it cannot be said he is wholly in the water nor wholly out
of it;) and in another manner by the animals, whose soul is all
absorbed in matter, but somewhat ennobled; and in another manner
by the metals, and in another by the earth; because it is the
most material, and therefore the most remote from and the most
inappropriate for the first most simple and noble virtue, which
is solely intellectual, that is, God."

	And in Canto XXIX. 136: --

     "The primal light, that all irradiates,
        By modes as many is received therein,
        As are the splendors wherewith it is mated."

	|76.~  ^Convito~ VII. 3: "Between the angelic nature,
which is an intellectual thing, and the human soul there is no
step, but they are both almost continous in the order of
gradation.....  Thus we are to suppose and firmly to believe,
that a man may be so noble, and of such lofty condition, that he
shall be almost an angel."

	|130.~  The Angels, and the Heavens, and the human soul,
being immediately inspired by God, are immutable and
indestructible.  But the elements and the souls of brutes and
plants are controlled by the stars, and are mutable and
perishable.

	|142.~  See ^Purg.~ XVI. 85: --

     "Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it
        Before it is, like to a little girl
        Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,
     Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,
        Save that, proceeding from a joyour Maker,
        Gladly it turns to that which gives it
        pleasure."

And also ^Purg.~ XXV. 70: --

     "The primal Motor turns to it well pleased
        At so great art of nature, and inspires
        A spirit new with virtue all replete."
