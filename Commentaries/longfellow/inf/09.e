	|1.~  The flush of anger passes from Virgil's cheek on
seeing the pallor of Dante's, and he tries to encourage him with
assurances of success; but betrays his own apprehensions in the
broken phrase, "If not," which he immediately covers with words
of cheer.

	|8.~  Such, or so great a one, is Beatrice, the "fair and
saintly Lady" of Canto II. 53.

	|9.~  The Angel who will open the gates of the City of
Dis.

	|16.~  Dante seems to think that he has already reached

	|52.~  Gower, ^Confessio Amantis~, I.: --

     "Cast nought thin eye upon Meduse
     That thou be turned into stone."

	Hawthorne has beautifully told the story of "The Gorgon's
Head," as well as many more of the classic fables, in his
^Wonder-Book.~

rescue Proserpine from the infernal regions.

	|62.~  The hidden doctrine seems to be, that Negation or
Unbelief is the Gorgon's head which changes the heart to stone;

	|112.~  At Arles lie buried, according to old tradition,
the Peers of Charlemagne and their ten thousand men at arms.
Archbishop Turpin, in his famous ^History of Charles the Great~,
XXX., Rodd's Translation, I. 52, says: --

     "After this the King and his army proceeded by the way of
     Gascony and Thoulouse, and came to Arles, where we found the
     army of Burgundy, which had left us in the hostile valley,
     bringing their dead by the way of Morbihan and Thoulouse, to
     bury them in the plain of Arles.  Here we performed the
     rites of Estolfo, Count of Champagne; of Solomon; Sampson,
     Duke of Burgundy; Arnold of Berlanda; Alberic of Burgundy;
     Gumard, Esturinite, Hato, Juonius, Berard, Berengaire, and
     Naaman, Duke of Bourbon, and of ten thousand of their
     soldiers."

	Boccacio comments upon these tombs as follows: --

     "At Arles, somewhat out of the city, are many tombs of
     stone, made of old for sepulchres, and some are large, and
     some are small, and some are better sculptured, and some not
     so well, peradventure according to the means of those who
     had them made; and upon some of them appear inscriptions
     after the ancient custom, I suppose in indication of those
     who are buried within.  The inhabitants of the country
     repeat a tradition of them, affirming that in that place
     there was once a great battle between William of Orange, or
     some other Christian prince, with his forces on one side,
     and infidel barbarians for Africa [on the other]; and that
     many Christians were slain in it; and that on the following
     night, by divine miracle, those tombs were brought there for
     the burial of the Christians, and so on the following
     morning all the dead Christians were buried in them."

	|113.~  Pola is a city in Istria.  "Near Pola," says

and of various forms."
