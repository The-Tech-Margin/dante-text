	|1.~  In this third round of the seventh circle are
punished the Violent against God,

     "In heart denying and blaspheming him,
     And by disdaining Nature and her bounty."

	|15.~  When he retreated across the Libyan desert with
the remnant of Pompey's army after the battle of Pharsalia.
Lucan, ^Pharsalia~, Book IX.: --

     "Foremost, behold, I lead you to the toil,
     My feet shall foremost print the dusty soil."

	|31.~  Boccaccio confesses that he does not know where
Dante found this tradition of Alexander.  Benvenuto da Imola says
it is a letter which Alexander wrote to Aristotle.  He quotes the
passage as follows: "In India ignited vapors fell from heaven
like snow.  I commanded my soldiers to trample them under foot."

	Dante perhaps took the incident from the old metrical
^Romance of Alexander~, which in some form or other was current
in his time.  In the English version of it, published by the
Roxburghe Club, we find the rain of fire, and a fall of snow; but
it is the snow, and not the fire, and the soldiers trample down.
So likewise in the French version. The English runs as follows,
line 4164: --

     "Than fandis he furth as I finde five and twenti days,
     Come to a velanus vale thare was a vile cheele,
     Quare flaggis of the fell snawe fell fra the heven,
     That was a brade, sais the buke, as battes ere of wolle.
     Than bett he many brigt fire and lest it bin nold,
     And made his folk with thaire feete as flores it to trede.
     .....................
     Than fell ther fra the firmament as it ware fell sparkes,
     Ropand doune o rede fire, than any rayne thikir."

	|45.~  Canto VIII. 83.

	|56.~  Mount Etna, under which, with his Cyclops, Vulcan
forged the thunderbolts of Jove.

	|63.~  Capaneus was one of the seven kings who besieged
Thebes.  Euripides, ^Phoenissae, line 1188, thus describes
his death: --

     While o'er the battlements sprung Capaneus,
     Jove struck him with his thunder, and the earth
     Resounded with the crack; meanwhile mankind
     Stood all aghast; from off the ladder's height
     His limbs were far asunder hurled, his hair
     Flew to'ards Olympus, to the ground his blood,
     His hands and feet whirled like Ixion's wheel,
     And to the earth his flaming body fell."

Also Gower, ^Confes. Amant.~, I.: --

     "As he the cite wolde assaile,
     God toke him selfe the bataile
     Ayen his pride, and fro the sky
     A firy thonder sudeinly
     He sende and him to pouder smote."

	|72.~  Like Hawthorne's scarlet letter, at once an
ornament and a punishment.

	|79.~  The Bulicame or Hot Springs of Viterbo.  Villani,
^Cronica~, Book 1. Ch. 51, gives the following brief account of
these springs, and of the origin of the name of Viterbo: --

     The city of Viterbo was built by the Romans, and in old
     times was called Vigezia, and the citizens Vigentians.  And
     the Romans sent the sick there on account of the baths which
     flow from the Bulicame, and therefore it was called ^Vita
     Erbo~, that is, life of the sick, or city of life."

	|80.~  "The building thus appropriated", says Mr. Barlow,
^Contributions to the Study of the Divine Comedy~, p. 129, "would
appear to have been the large ruined edifice known as the Bagno
di Ser Paolo Benigno, situated between the Bulicame and Viterbo.
About half a mile beyond the Porta di Faule, which leads to
Toscanella, we come to a way called Reillo, after which we arrive
at the said ruined edifice, which received the water from the
Bulicame by conduits, and has popularly been regarded as the
Bagno delle Meretrici alluded to by Dante; there is no other
building here found, which can dispute with it the claim to this
distinction."

	|102.~  The shouts and cymbals of the Corybantes,
drowning the cries of the infant Jove, lest Saturn should find
him and devour him.

	|103.~  The statue of Time, turning its back upon the
East and looking towards Rome.  Compare Daniel ii. 31.

	|105.~  The Ages of Gold, Silver, Brass, and Iron.  See
Ovid, ^Metamorph.~ I.

	See also Don Quixote's discourse to the goatherds,
inspired by the acorns they gave him, Book II. Chap. 3; and
Tasso's Ode to the Golden Age, in the ^Aminta.~

	|113.~  The Tears of Time, forming the infernal rivers
that flow into Cocytus.

	Milton, Parad.  Lost, II. 577: --

     "Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;
     Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
     Cocytus, named of lamentation loud
     Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,
     Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
     Far off from these a slow and silent stream,
     Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks
     Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
     Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain."
