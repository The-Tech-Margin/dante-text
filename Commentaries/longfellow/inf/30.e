	|1.~  In this Canto the same Bolgia is continued, with
different kinds of Falsifiers.

	|4.~  Athamas, king of Thebes and husband of Ino,
daughter of Cadmus.  His madness is thus described by Ovid,
^Metamorph.~ IV., Eusden's Tr.: --

     "Now Athamas cries out, his reason fled,
     `Here, fellow-hunters, let the toils be spread.
     I saw a lioness, in quest of food,
     With her two young, run roaring in this wood.'
     Again the fancied savages were seen,
     As thro' his palace still he chased his queen;
     Then tore Learchus from her breast: the child
     Streched little arms, and on its father smiled, --
     A father now no more, -- who now begun
     Around his head to whirl his giddy son,
     And, quite insensible to nature's call,
     The helpless infant flung against the wall.
     The same mad poison in the mother wrought;
     Young Melicerta in her arms she caught,
     And with disordered tresses, howling, flies,
     `O Bacchus, Ev#oe, Bacchus!' loud she cries.
     The name of Bacchus Juno laughed to hear,
     And said, `Thy foster-god has cost thee dear.'
     A rock there stood, whose side the beating waves
     Had long consumed, and hollowed into caves.
     The head shot forwards in a bending steep,
     And cast a dreadful covert o'er the deep.
     The wretched Ino, on destruction bent,
     Climbed up the cliff, -- such strength her fury lent:
     Thence with her guiltless boy, who wept in vain,
     At one bold spring she plunged into the main."

	|16.~  Hecuba, wife of Priam of Troy, and mother of
Polyxena and Polydorus.  Ovid, XIII., Stanyan's Tr.: --

     "When on the banks her son in ghastly hue
     Transfixed with Thracian arrows strikes her view,
     The matrons shrieked; her big swoln grief surpassed
     The power of utterance; she stood aghast;
     She had nor speech, nor tears to give relief:
     Excess of woe suppressed the rising grief.
     Lifeless as stone, on earth she fix'd her eyes;
     And then look'd up to Heav'n with wild surprise,
     Now she contemplates o'er with sad delight
     Her son's pale visage; then her aking sight
     Dwells on his wounds: she varies thus by turns,
     Till with collected rage at length she burns,
     Wild as the mother-lion, when among
     The haunts of prey she seeks her ravished young:
     Swift flies the ravisher; she marks his trace,
     And by the print directs her anxious chase.
     So Hecuba with mingled grief and rage
     Pursues the king, regardless of her age.
     .....
     Fastens her forky fingers in his eyes;
     Tears out the rooted balls; her rage pursues,
     And in the hollow orbs her hand imbrues.
     "The Thracians, fired at this inhuman scene,
     With darts and stones assail the frantic queen.
     She snarls and growls, nor in an human tone;
     Then bites impatient at the bounding stone;
     Extends her jaws, as she her voice would raise
     To keen invectives in her wonted phrase;
     But barks, and thence the yelping brute betrays."

	|31.~  Griffolino d'Arezzo, mentioned in Canto XXIX. 109.

	|42.~  The same "mad sprite," Gianni Schicchi, mentioned
in line 32.  "Buoso Donati of Florence," says Benvenuto,
"although a nobleman and of an illustrious house, was
nevertheless like other noblemen of his time, and by means of
thefts had greatly increased his patrimony.  When the hour of
death drew near, the sting of conscience caused him to make a
will in which he gave fat legacies to many people; whereupon his
son Simon, (the ^Ottimo~ says his nephew,) thinking himself
enormously aggrieved, suborned Vanni Schicchi dei Cavalcanti, who
got into Buoso's bed, and made a will in opposition to the other.
Gianni much resembled Buoso." In this will Gianni Schicchi did
not forget himself, while making Simon heir; for, according to
the ^Ottimo~, he put this clause into it: "To Gianni Schicchi I
bequeath my mare."  This was the "lady of the herd," and
Benvenuto adds, "none more beautiful was to be found in Tuscany;
and it was valued at a thousand florins."

	|61.~  Messer Adamo, a false-coiner of Brescia, who at
the instigation of the Counts Guido, Alessandro, and Aghinolfo of
Romena, counterfeited the golden florin of Florence, which bore
on one side a lily, and on the other the figure of John the
Baptist.

	|64.~  Tasso, ^Gerusalemme~, XIII. 60, Fairfax's Tr.: --

     "He that the gliding rivers erst had seen
     Adown their verdant channels gently rolled,
     Or falling streams, which to the valleys green,
     Distilled from tops of Alpine mountains cold,
     Those he desired in vain, new torments been
     Augumented thus with wish of comforts old;
     Those waters cool he drank in vain conceit,
     Which more increased his thirst, increased his heat."

	|65.~  The upper valley of the Arno is in the province of
Cassentino.  Quoting these three lines, Amp@ere, ^Voyage
Dantesque~, 246, says: "In these untranslatable verses, there is
a feeling of humid freshness, which almost makes one shudder.  I
owe it to truth to say, that the Cassentine was a great deal less
fresh and less verdant in reality than in the poetry of Dante,
and that in the midst of the aridity which surrounded me, this
poetry, by its very perfection, made one feel something of the
punishment of Master Adam."

	|73.~  Forsyth, ^Italy~, 116, says: "The castle of
Romena, mentioned in these verses, now stands in ruins on a
precipice about a mile from our inn, and not far off is a spring
which the peasants call Fonte Branda.  Might I presume to differ
from his commentators, Dante, in my opinion, does not mean the
great fountain of Siena, but rather this obscure spring; which,
though less known to the world, was an object more familiar to
the poet himself, who took refuge here from proscription, and an
image more natural to the coiner who was burnt on the spot."

	Amp@ere is of the same opinion, ^Voyage Dantesque~, 246:
"The Fonte Branda, mentioned by Master Adam, is assuredly the
fountain thus named, which still flows not far from the tower of
Romena, between the place of the crime and that of its
punishment."

	On the other hand, Mr. Barlow, ^Contributions~, remarks:
"This little fount was known only to so few, that Dante, who
wrote for the Italian people generally, can scarcely be thought
to have meant this, when the famous Fonte Branda at Siena was, at
least by name, familiar to them all, and formed an image more in
character with the insatiable thirst of Master Adam."

	Poetically the question is of slight importance; for, as
Fluellen says, "There is a river in Macedon, and there is also
moreover a river at Monmount,.....and there is salmons in both."

	|86.~  This line and line II of Canto XXIX. are cited by
Gabrielle Rossetti in confirmation of his theory of the
"Principal Allegory of the Inferno," that the city of Dis is
Rome.  He says, ^Spirito Antipapale~, I. 62, Miss Ward's Tr.: --

     "This well is surrounded by a high wall, and the wall by a
     vast trench; the circuit of the trench is twenty-two miles,
     and that of the wall eleven miles.  Now the outward trench
     of the walls of Rome (whether real or imaginary we say not)
     was reckoned by Dante's contemporaries to be exactly
     twenty-two miles; and the walls of the city were then, and
     still are, eleven miles round.  Hence it is clear, that the
     ^wicked time~ which looks into Rome, as into a mirror, sees
     there the corrupt place which is the final goal to its
     waters or people, that is, the figurative Rome, `dread seat
     of Dis.'"

	The trench here spoken of is the last trench of
Malebolge.  Dante mentions no wall about the well; only giants
standiing round it like towers.

	|97.~  Potiphar's wife.

	|98.~  Virgil's "perjured Sinon," the Greek who persuaded
the Trojans to accept the wooden horse, telling them it was meant
to protect the city, in lieu of the statue of Pallas, stolen by
Diomed and Ulysses.

	Chaucer, ^Nonnes Preestes Tale~: --

     "O false dissimilour, O Greek Sinon,
     That broughtest Troye at utterly to sorwe."

	|103.~  The disease of ^tympanites~ is so called "because
the abdomen is distended with wind, and sounds like a drum when
struck."

	|128.~  Ovid, ^Metamorph.~ III.: --

     "A fountain in a darksome wood,
     Nor stained with falling leaves nor rising mud."
