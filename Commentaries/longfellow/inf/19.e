	|1.~  The Third Bolgia is devoted to the Simoniacs, so
called from Simon Magus, the Sorcerer mentioned in ^Acts viii.~
9, 18.  See ^Par.~ XXX. Note 147.

	Brunetto Latini touches lightly upon them in the
^Tesoretto~, XXI. 259, on account of their high ecclesiastical
dignity.  His pupil is less reverential in this particular.

     Altri per simonia
       Si getta in mala via,
     E Dio e' Santi offende
       E vende le prebende,
     E Sante Sagramente,
       E mette `nfra la gente
     Assempri di mal fare.
       Ma questo lascio stare,
     Ch@e tocca a ta' persone,
       Che non @e mia ragione
     Di dirne lungamente."

	Chaucer, ^Persones Tale~, speaks thus of Simony: --

     "Certes simonie is cleped of Simon Magus, that wold have
     bought for temporel catel the yefte that God had yeven by
     the holy gost to Seint Peter, and to the Apostles: and
     therefore understond ye, that both he that selleth and he
     that byeth thinges spirituel ben called Simoniakes, be it by
     catel, be it by procuring, or by fleshly praier of his
     frendes, fleshly frendes, or spirituel frendes, fleshly in
     two maners, as by kinrede or other frendes: sothly, if they
     pray for him that is not worthy and able, it is simonie, if
     he take the benefice: and if he be worthy and able, ther is
     non."

	|5.~  Gower, ^Confes. Amant.~ I.: --

     "A trompe with a sterne breth,
     Which was cleped the trompe of deth.
     ........
     He shall this dredfull trompe blowe
     To-fore his gate and make it knowe,
     How that the jugement is yive
     Of deth, which shall nought be foryive."

	|19.~  Lami, in his ^Deliciae Eruditorum~, makes a
strange blunder in reference to this passage.  He says: "Not long
ago the baptismal font, which stood in the middle of Saint John's
at Florence, was removed; and in the pavement may still be seen
the octagonal shape of its ample outline.  Dante says, that, when
a boy, he fell into it and was near drowning; or rather he fell
into one of the circular basins of water, which surrounded the
principal font."  Upon this Arrivabeni, ^Comento Storico~, p.
588, where I find this extract, remarks: "Not Dante, but Lami,
staring at the moon, fell into the hole."

	|20.~  Dante's enemies had accused him of committing this
act through impiety.  He takes this occasion to vindicate
himself.

	|33.~  Probably an allusion to the red stockings worn by
the Popes.

	|50.~  Burying alive with the head downward and the feet
in the air was the inhuman punishment of hired assassins,
"according to justice and the municipal law in Florence," says
the ^Ottimo.~ It was called ^Propagginare~, to plant in the
manner of vine-stocks.

	Dante stood bowed down like the confessor called back by
the criminal in order to delay the moment of his death.

	|53.~  Benedetto Gaetani, Pope Boniface VIII.  Gower,
^Conf. Amant.~ II., calls him

     "Thou Boneface, thou proude clerke,
     Misleder of the papacie."

	This is the Boniface who frightened Celestine from the
papacy, and persecuted him to death after his resignation.  "The
lovely Lady" is the Church.  The fraud was his collusion with
Charles II. of Naples."He went to King Charles by night,
secretly, and with few attendants," says Villani, VIII. ch. 6, "
and said to him: `King, thy Pope Celestine had the will and the
power to serve thee in thy Sicilian wars, but did not know how:
but if thou wilt contrive with thy friends the cardinals to have
me elected Pope, I shall know how, and shall have the will and
the power'; promising upon his faith and oath to aid him with all
the power of the Church."  Farther on he continues: "He was very
magnanimous and lordly, and demanded great honor, and knew well
how to maintain and advance the cause of the Church, and on
account of his knowledge and power was much dreaded and feared.
He was avaricious exceedingly in order to aggrandize the Church
and his relations, not being over-scrupulous about gains, for he
said that all things were lawful which were of the Church."

	He was chosen Pope in 1294.  "The inauguration of
Boniface," says Milman ^Latin Christ.~, Book IX., ch. 7, "was the
most magnificent which Rome had ever beheld.  In his procession
to St. Peter's and back to the Lateran palace, where he was
entertained, he rode not a humble ass, but a noble white horse,
richly caparisoned: he had a crown on his head; the King of
Naples held the bridle on one side, his son, the King of Hungary,
on the other.  The nobility of Rome, the Orsinis, the Colonnas,
the Savellis, the Stefaneschi, the Annibaldi, who had not only
welcomed him to Rome, but conferred on him the Senatorial
dignity, followed in a body: the procession could hardly force
its way through the masses of the kneeling people.  In the midst,
a furious hurricane burst over the city, and extinguished every
lamp and torch in the church.  A darker omen followed: a riot
broke out among the populace, in which forty lives were lost.
The day after, the Pope dined in public in the Lateran; the two
Kings waited behind his chair."

	Dante indulges towards him a fierce Ghibelline hatred,
and assigns him his place of torment before he is dead.  In Canto
XXVII. 85, he calls him "the Prince of the new Pharisees"; and,
after many other bitter allusions in various parts of the poem,
puts into the mouth of St. Peter, ^Par.~ XXVII.22, the terrible
invective that makes the whole heavens red with anger.

     "He who usurps upon the earth my place,
       My place, my place, which vacant has become
       Now in the presence of the Son of God,
     Has of my cemetery made a sewer
       Of blood and fetor, whereat the Perverse,
       Who fell from here, below there is appeased."

	He died in 1303.  See Note 87, ^Purg.~ XX.

	|70.~  Nicholas III, of the Orsini (the Bears) of Rome,
chosen Pope in 1277.  "He was the first Pope, or one of the
first," says Villani, VII. ch. 54, in whose court simony was
openly practised."  On account of his many accomplishments he was
surnamed ^Il Compiuto.~  Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~, Book XI. ch.  4,
says of him: "At length the election fell on John Gaetano, of the
noble Roman house, the Orsini, a man of remarkable beauty of
person and demeanor.  His name, `the Accomplished,' implied that
in him met all the graces of the handsomest clerks in the world,
but he was a man likewise of irreproachable morals, of vast
ambition, and of great ability."  He died in 1280.

	|83.~  The French Pope Clement V., elected in 1305, by
the influence of Philip the Fair of France, with sundry
humiliating conditions.  He transferred the Papal See from Rome
to Avignon, where it remained for seventy-one years in what
Italian writers call its "Babylonian captivity."  He died in
1314, on his way to Bordeaux.  "He had hardly crossed the Rhone,"
says Milman, ^Lat.  Christ.~, Book XII. ch. 5, "when he was
seized with mortal sickness at Roquemaure.  The Papal treasure
was seized by his followers, especially his nephew; his remains
were treated with such utter neglect, that the torches set fire
to the catafalque under which he lay, not in a state.  His body,
covered only with a single sheet, all that his rapacious retinue
had left to shroud their forgotten master, was half
burned.....before alarm was raised.  His ashes were borne back to
Carpentras and solemnly interered."

	|85.~  Jason, to whom Antiochus Epiphanes granted a
"license to set him up a place for exercise, and for the training
up of youth in the fashions of the heathen."

	|2 Maccabees iv. 13: "Now such was the height of Greek
fashions, and increase of the heathenish manners, through the
exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch and not high
priest, that the priests had no courage to serve any more at the
alter, but, despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices,
hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place
of exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth."

	|87.~  Philip the Fair of France.  See Note 82.  "He was
one of the handsomest men in the world," says Villani IX. 66,
"and one of the largest in person, and well proportioned in every
limb, -- a wise and good man for a layman."

	|94.~  Matthew, chosen as an Apostle in the place of
Judas.

	|99.~  According to Villani, VII. 54, Pope Nicholas III.
wished to marry his niece to a nephew of Charles of Anjou, King
of Sicily.  To this alliance the King would not consent, saying
:"Although he wears the red stockings, his lineage is not worthy
to mingle with ours, and his power is not hereditary."  This made
the Pope indignant and, together with the bribes of John of
Procida, led him to encourage the rebellion in Sicily, which
broke out a year after the Pope's death in the "Sicilian
Vespers," 1282.

	|107.~  The Church of Rome under Nicholas, Boniface, and
Clement.  ^Revelation~ xvii. 1-3: --

     "And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven
     vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I
     will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that
     sitteth upon many waters; with whom the kings of the earth
     have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth
     have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.  So
     he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness: and I
     saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names
     of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."

	The seven heads are interpreted to mean the Seven
Virtues, and the ten horns the Ten Commandments.

	|110. Revelation xvii.~ 12, 13: --

     And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings,.....and
     shall give their power and strength unto the beast."

	|117.~  Gower, ^Confes. Amant., Prologus~: --

     "The patrimonie and the richesse
     Which to Silvester in pure almesse
     the firste Constantinus lefte."

	Upon this supposed donation of immense domains by
Constantine to the Pope, called the "Patrimony of St. Peter,"
Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~, Book I. ch. 2, remarks: --

     "Silvester has become a kind of hero of religious fable.
     But it was not so much the genuine mythical spirit which
     unconsciously transmutes history into legend; it was rather
     deliberate invention, with a specific aim and design, which,
     in direct defiance of history, accelerated the baptism of
     Constantine, and sanctified a porphyry vessel as
     appropriated to, or connected with, that holy use: and at a
     later period produced the monstrous fable of the Donation.

     "But that with which Constantine actualy did invest the
     Church, the right of holding landed property, and receiving
     it by bequest, was far more valuable to the Christian
     hierarchy, and not least to the Bishop of Rome, than a
     premature and prodigal endowment."
