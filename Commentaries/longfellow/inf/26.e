	|1.~  The Eighth Bolgia, in which Fraudulent Counsellors
are punished.

	|4.~  Of these five Florentine nobles, Cianfa Donati,
Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso degli Abati, Puccio Sciancato, and
Guercio Cavalcanti, nothing is known but what Dante tells us.
Perhaps that is enough.

	|7.~  See ^Purg. IX. 13: --

     "Just at the hour when her sad lay begins
       The little swallow, near unto the morning,
       Perchance in memory of her former woes
     And when the mind of man, a wanderer
       More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,
       Almost prophetic in its visions is."

	|9.~  The disasters soon to befall Florence, and in which
even the neighboring town of Prato would rejoice, to mention no
others.  These disasters were the fall of the wooden bridge of
Carraia, with a crowd upon it, witnessing a Miracle Play on the
Arno; the strife of the Bianchi and Neri; and the great fire of
1304.  See Villani, VIII. 70, 71.  Napier, ^Florentine History~,
I. 394, gives this account: --

     "Battles first began between the Cerchi and Giugni at their
     houses in the Via del Garbo; they fought day and night, and
     with the aid of the Cavalcanti and Antellesi the former
     subdued all that quarter: a thousand rural adherents
     strengthened their bands, and that day might have seen the
     Neri's destruction if an unforseen disaster had not turned
     the scale.  A certain dissolute priest, called Neri Abati,
     prior of San Piero Scheraggio, false to his family and in
     concert with the Black chiefs, consented to set fire to the
     dwellings of his own kinsmen in Orto-san-Michele; the
     flames, assisted by faction, spread rapidly over the richest
     and most crowded part of Florence: shops, warehouses,
     towers, private dwellings and palaces, from the old to the
     new market-place, from ^Vacchereccia to Porta Santa Maria~
     and the ^Ponte Vecchio~, all was one broad sheet of fire:
     more than nineteen hundred houses were consumed; plunder and
     devastation revelled unchecked amongst the flames, whole
     races were reduced in one moment to beggary, and vast
     magazines of the richest merchandise were destroyed.  The
     Cavalcanti, one of the most opulent families in Florence,
     beheld their whole property consumed, and lost all courage;
     they made no attempt to save it, and, after almost gaining
     possession of the city, were finally overcome by the
     opposite faction."

	|10. Macbeth~, I. 7: --

     "If it were done when `t is done, then `t were well
     It were done quickly."

	|23.~  See ^Parad.~ XII. 112: --

     "O glorius stars!  O light impregnated
     With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge
     All of my genius, whatso'er it be."

	|24.~  I may not balk or deprive myself of this good.

	|34.~ The Prophet Elisha, 2 ^Kings~ ii. 23: --

     "And he went up from thence unto Bethel; and as he was going
     up by the way, there came forth little children out of the
     city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald
     head; go up, thou bald head.  And he turned back, and looked
     on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there
     came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and
     two children of them."

	|35.~  2 ^Kings~ ii. II: --

     "And it came to pass, as they still went on and talked,
     that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses
     of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by
     a whirlwind into heaven."

	|54.~  These two sons of OEdipus, Eteocles and
Polynices, were so hostile to each other, that, when after death
their bodies were burned on the same funeral pile, the flames
swayed apart, and the ashes separated.  Statius, ^Thebaid~, XII.
430, Lewis's Tr.: --

     "Again behold the brothers!  When the fire
     Pervades their limbs in many a curling spire,
     The vast hill trembles, and the intruder's corse
     Is driven from the pile with sudden force.
     The flames, dividing at the point, ascend,
     And at each other adverse rays extend.
     Thus when the ruler of the infernal state,
     Pale-visaged Dis, commits to stern debate
     The sister-fiends, their brands, held forth to fight,
     Now clash, then part, and shed a transient light."

	|56.~  The most cunning of the Greeks at the siege of
Troy, now united in their punishment, as before in warlike wrath.

	|59.~  As Troy was overcome by the fraud of the wooden
horse, it was in a poetic sense the gateway by which AEneas
went forth to establish the Roman empire in Italy.

	|62.~  Deidamia was a daughter of Lycomedes of Sycros, at
whose court Ulysses found Achilles, disguised in woman's attire,
and enticed him away to the siege of Troy, telling him that,
according to the oracle, the city could not be taken without him,
but not telling him that, according to the same oracle, he would
lose his life there.

	|63.~  Ulysses and Diomed together stole the Palladium,
or statue of Pallas, at Troy, the safeguard and protection of the
city.

	|75.~  The Greeks scorned all other nations as "outside
barbarians."  Even Virgil, a Latian, has to plead with Ulysses
the merit of having praised him in the AEneid.

	|108.~  The Pillars of Hercules at the straits of
Gibraltar; Abyla on the African shore, and Gibraltar on the
Spanish; in which the popular mind has lost its faith, except as
symbolized in the columns on the Spanish dollar, with the legend,
^Plus ultra.~

	Brunetto Latini, ^Tesor.~ IX. 119: --

     "Appresso questo mare,
       Vidi diritto stare
     Gran colonne, le quali
       Vi mise per segnali
     Ercules il potente,
       Per mostrare alla gente
     Che loco sia finata
       La terra e terminata."

	|125. Odyssey~, XI. 155: "Well-fitted oars, which are
also wings to ships."

	|127.~  Humboldt, ^Personal Narrative~, II. 19, Miss
Williams's Tr., has this passage: "From the time we entered the
torrid zone, we were never wearied with admiring, every night,
the beauty of the Southern sky, which, as we advanced toward the
south, opened new constellations to our view.  We feel an
indescribable sensation, when, on approaching the equator, and
particularly on passing from on hemisphere to the other, we see
those stars, which we have contemplated from our infancy,
progressively sink, and finally disappear.  Nothing awakens in
the traveller a livelier remembrance of the immense distance by
which he is separated from his country, than the aspect of an
unknown firmament.  The grouping of the stars of the first
magnitude, some scattered nebulae, rivalling in splendor the
milky way, and tracks of space remarkable for their extreme
blackness, give a particular physiognomy to the Southern sky.
This sight fills with admiration even those who, uninstructed in
the branches of accurate science, feel the same emotion of
delight in the contemplation of the heavenly vault, as in the
view of a beautiful landscape, or a majestic site.  A traveller
has no need of being a botanist, to recognize the torrid zone on
the mere aspect of its vegetation; and without having acquired
any notions of astronomy, without any acquaintance with the
celestial charts of Flamstead and De la Caille, he feels he is
not in Europe, when he sees the immense constellation of the
Ship, or the phosphorescent clouds of Magellan, arise on the
horizon."

	|142.~  Compare Tennyson's ^Ulysses~: --

     "There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:
     There gloom the dark broad seas.  My mariners,
     Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me, --
     That ever with a frolic welcome took
     The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
     Free hearts, free foreheads, -- you and I are old;
     Old age hath yet his honor and his toil;
     Death closes all: but something ere the end,
     Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
     Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
     The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:
     The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep
     Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends,
     `T is not too late to seek a newer world.
     Push off, and, sitting well in order, smite
     The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
     To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
     Of all the western stars, until I die.
     It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
     It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
     And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
     Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
     We are not now that strength which in old days
     Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
     One equal temper of heroic hearts,
     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
