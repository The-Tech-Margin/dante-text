Rossetti's Inferno was edited by MF. RH thinks MF included some of
the "endnotes" and "tersina" text into her edition of Inf. I. So the
"endnotes" and "tersina" text does not appear in the database as a
separate document.

Rossetti's Purgatorio has not yet been edited by the DDP. Thus it is
not yet loaded into the database.

There is no Paradiso from Rossetti.
