Copied desc, inf, para, purg from Commentaries/bianchi.    -stc

On 13 Oct. '98 RH entered his recorded changes for all three cantiche
of Bianchi and recompressed all files.  NB: These were _casual_ errors
spotted over the years, not a full review of Bianchi's text.  While
editing Inf. 26, RH found two more "casual" errors.  His guess is that
there are some more of these.  But in general the text looked fairly
clean.
