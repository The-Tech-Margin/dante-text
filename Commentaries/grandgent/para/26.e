	|4.  Ti risense~, `regainest the sense.' 

	|6.  La compense~, `thou make up for it.' 

	|7.  S' appunta~, `aims.' 

	|8.  Fa ragion~, `depend upon it.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXX, 145. 

	|10.  Dia~, `divine.'  Cf. XIV, 34; XXIII, 107. 

	|12.~  Ananias cured St. Paul of his blindness by `putting
his hands on him.'  Acts ix, 17-18. 

	|16.~  Dante answers St. John's query (ll. 7-8): what is the
object of thy love? 

	|17.~  Rev. i, 8: `I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
the ending, saith the Lord.'  Dante knew the name ^alpha~,
possibly not ^omega.~  The Vulgate in the 13th century read
`alpha et %omega\' or `%alpha\ et %omega\.' 

	|21.~  `Made me solicitous to speak again.' 

	|22.  A pi@u angusto vaglio~, `with a finer sieve.' 

	|26.~  By revealed Truth. 

	|28-30.~  `For good, as such, kindles love in proportion as
it is understood, and kindles the greater love, the more goodness
it contains within it.' 

	|31.  A l' Essenza~ is to be connected with ^si mova~ in l.
34. -- |Avvantaggio~, `supremacy.' -- Since love is attracted by
goodness, and all goodness is in God, he must be the primal
object of love. 

	|34.~  `Must turn more than to any other (essence).'  The 
subject of |si mova~ is ^la mente di ciascun~ etc. 

	|35.  Cerne~, `discerns.' 

	|36.  In che~, `upon which.' -- |Prova~, `argument.' 

	|37.  Sterne~, `unfolds.' 

	|38.  Colui~: Aristotle, who in his ^Metaphysics~, XI, vii,
discusses the existence, the unity, and the perfection of the
First Mover, and in viii the nature of the First Substance. 

	|40.  Sternel~ = ^lo sterne.~ -- |Autore~: God. 

	|42.~  Exod. xxxiii, 19: `I will make all my goodness pass
before thee.' 

	|44.  Preconio~, `proclamation': probably the Gospel of
John, which opens solemnly and mysteriously with the announcement
of the Incarnation (`In the beginning was the Word,' etc.), God's
great sacrifice to man; cf. John iii, 16.  Some critics, however,
think that the reference is to the Revelation, and particularly
to the verse cited in the note to l. 17. 

	|45.  Bando~, `heralding.' 

	|46.  Per~: in conformity with. 

	|48.~  `The highest of thy loves looks to God.' 

	|49-51.~  An odd combination of metaphors.  Such mixing is
not uncommon in Dante: cf. ^Conv.~, II, i, 1-13. -- |Tu suone~,
`thou mayest announce.' 

	|53.~  `Christ's Eagle' is John.  The `four beasts' of Rev.
iv, 7, are traditionally identified with the four Evangelists;
St. John is the `flying eagle.' 

	|58.  Essere~, `existence.' 

	|61.~  Cf. ll. 31-36. 

	|64-66.~  I love the various creatures of God that make up
the world, in proportion to the grace which their Maker, in his
predestination, has bestowed upon them. 

	|69.~  Isaiah vi, 3, and Rev. iv, 8. 

	|70-71.~  `And as one is awakened by a keen light because of
the spirit (or sense) of sight running to meet...'  Cf. ^Conv.~,
III, ix, 66-105, where the act of sight is described
scientifically. 

	|72.  Gonna~, `coat': membrane of the eye. 

	|73.  A borre~, `shrinks from.' 

	|74.  Nescia~, `senseless.' -- |Vigilia~, `waking.' 

	|75.  Stimativa~, `judgment.' 

	|76.  Quisquilia~, `mote.' 

	|79.  Mei~ = ^meglio.~ 

	|83.  Vagheggia~, `worships': the subject is |l' anima
prima~, Adam. 

	|85.  Fronda~, `bough' or `branch.' -- |Flette~, `bends.' --
Cf. ^Theb.~, VI, 854-857. 

	|87.  Sublima~, `uplifts.' 

	|88.  In tanto in Quant'~, `while.' 

	|89.  Stupendo~, `amazed.' 

	|93.  Nuro~ (Latin ^nurus~), `daughter-in-law.' 

	|97.  Broglia~, `stirs.' -- It is not evident to us just
what kind of a creature Dante had in mind, but it is quite
possible that he may have been thinking of a falcon. 

	|98-99.~  `So that its feeling must be revealed by the 
response that its wrapper makes to it.' 

	|102.~  `How joyously it came to do me pleasure.' 

	|103.  Proferta~, `uttered.' 

	|107-108.~  `Which makes itself an image of other things,
while nothing makes of itself an image of it (the mirror).'  God
reflects everything, but nothing can reflect God.  Cf. ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. lvii, Art. 2: `Deus per essentiam suam, 
per quam omnia causat, est similitudo omnium.' -- There are, 
however, other readings of the text, and other interpretations: 
see ^Giorn. dant.~, XIII, 97; ^Modern Language Review~, l. 116. 

	|109.  Quant' @e che~, `how long it is since.' 

	|110.  Costei~: Beatrice, who in the Garden of Eden prepared
Dante for the ascent to Heaven. 

	|112.  Quanto fu diletto~, `how long it (the garden) was a
delight.' 

	|113.  Disdegno~: the `wrath' of God. 

	|117.  Il trapassar del segno~, `transgressing the bound.' 
Adam's sin was not gluttony, but disobedience, caused by pride. 
Cf. St. Augustine, ^De Civitate Dei~, XIV, xii-xiv. 

	|118.~  `Therefore in the place whence thy lady drew
Virgil': in the Limbus.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 52 ff. 

	|119.  Volumi~, `revolutions': cf. XXIII, 112; XXVIII, 14. 

	|120.  Concilio~: the `assembly' of the blest, for which
Adam yearned before his release from Limbus by Christ. 

	|121.  Lui~: the sun. -- |Lumi~: the signs of the zodiac. 

	|122.~  Gen. v, 5: `And all the days that Adam lived were
nine hundred and thirty years.' 

	|123.  Fu' mi~ = ^mi fui~, `I was': cf. ^Purg.~ XXII, 90. --
The two numbers added make 5232 years between the creation of 
Adam and the Crucifixion.  Cf.  ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 62. -- Eusebius
of Caesarea, cited by Scart., puts the birth of Christ in the
year 5200 of the world. 

	|125.~  The `unaccomplishable task' which Nimrod's people 
attempted was the building of the Tower of Babel: Gen. xi, 4-9. 
Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 77-78; ^Purg.~ XII, 34. -- Dante evidently
changed his opinion on this subject, for in ^Vulg. El.~, I, vi,
49-61, he had said that Adam's language was spoken by all men
until the confusion of tongues, and by the Hebrews after that
event.  His study of human speech doubtless led him to the
conclusion that an unwritten language could not last without
change through many generations. 

	|127-129.~  `For no product of reason was ever permanent for
all time, because of human inclination, which varies with the
sky.' 

	|130.~  `It is a natural operation for man to speak': hence
he always does speak, in some fashion. 

	|132.  Abbella~, `suits.' 

	|134.~  We do not know where Dante got the idea that the
first name of God was ^I.~  This letter is the initial of
^Jehovah~, and also of ^Jah~: cf. Ps. lxviii (Vulg.  lxvii), 5
(`extol him...by his name Jah').  Moreover, standing for the
number 1, it is the symbol of unity.  See D. Guerri, ^Il nome
adamitico di Dio~ in ^Di alcuni versi dotti della `Divina
Commedia,~' 1908. -- There are several other readings. 

	|136.  El~ is the Hebrew name.  St. Isidore, ^Etymologiae~,
VII, i: `Primum apud Hebraeos Dei nomen ^El~ dicitur.'  Cf.
^Vulg. El.~ I, iv, 26-31. 

	|137-138.~  Cf. Horace, ^Ars Poetica~, 60-61. 

	|139-142.~  Adam lived in the Garden of Eden, on the
mountaintop, before and after his sin, only about six hours --
`from the first hour to the one that follows the sixth, when the
sun changes quadrant' (passes from the first quadrant, or 90+o~,
to the second), i.e., from sunrise until the hour that follows 
noon.  Among the various estimates of theologians, Dante chose 
one of the shortest, that of Petrus Comestor (cf. XII, 134).
