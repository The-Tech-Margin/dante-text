	|2.  Miseri mortali~: cf. Virgil, Georgics, III, 66, miseris
mortalibus.' -- The subject of |aperse~ is ^quella~ (Beatrice) in
l. 3. 

	|4.  Doppiero~, `wax torch.' 

	|8.  El~, `it': the truth. 

	|9.  Esso~: the glass. -- |Metro~, `measure.' 

	|13.  Tocchi~ = ^toccati.~ 

	|14.  Volume~, `revolution,' i.e., heaven: cf. XXIII, 112,
XXVI, 119. 

	|15.  S' adocchi~, `one gazes.'  Contemplation of the Primum
Mobile suggests the image of the angels and the universe in their
relation to God. 

	|17.  Viso~, `eye.' 

	|19.  Quinci~, `from here below': from the earth. -- |Poca~
= ^piccola.~ 

	|22.  Cotanto~ is to be connected with ^distante~ in l. 25,
and ^cotanto distante~ is correlative with ^quanto appresso~: `as
near as'...`so far away'... 

	|23.  Luce~ (object of |cigner~): the moon or a star.  Cf.
X, 67-69. 

	|25.  Igne~ (Latin ^ignis~), `fire.' 

	|27.~  The motion of the Primum Mobile itself. 

	|28.  Circumcinto~, `girt around.' 

	|31.  Sparto~, `widespread.' 

	|32.~  `Juno's messenger' is Iris, the rainbow: cf. ^Met.~,
I, 270-271. 

	|33.  Arto~, `narrow': cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 42; ^Purg.~ XXVII, 
132.

	|53.  Templo~: this sphere. 

	|54.~  Cf. XXVII, 112. 

	|55.  Convienmi~ = ^mi conviene.~ -- |Essemplo~: the angelic
circles are an `example,' or pattern, of the material spheres.

philosophers attempt to solve the problem of the relation of the
spiritual to the physical world. -- |Sodo~, `hard.' 

	|63.~  `And whet thy wits upon it.' 

	|67.~  `Greater goodness must work greater weal.' 

	|68.~  `Greater weal is contained by a greater body.' 

	|70.  Costui~, `this body,' the Primum Mobile. -- |Rape~ 
(Latin ^rapit~), `drags.' 

	|73.  Circonde~, `puttest...about.' 

	|76.  Consequenza~, `correspondence' of each heaven to its
governing Intelligence, or order of angels. 

	|77.~  `Of greater (size) to more (intelligence) and of 
smaller (size) to less (intelligence).' 

	|81.~  The wind-gods were sometimes represented as heads 
blowing a threefold blast from the middle and the two corners of
their mouths.  See Ristoro d' Arezzo, ^Composizione del mondo~, 
VII, iii.  Thus Boreas blows not only the north wind, but also 
the northwest and northeast.  The last is, for Italy, the
`mildest' and clearest. -- For the whole image, cf. ^Aen.~, XII,
365-367. 

	|82.  Roffia~, `rubbish.'  The word apparently meant the 
refuse of tanned hides: see ^Bull.~, III, 154. 

	|84.  Parroffia~, `parish,' quarter.  See ^Bull.~, III, 153.

	|88.  Restaro~, `had ceased.' 

	|90.~  The sparks into which the fiery rings resolve
themselves represent the individual angels that compose the
orders.  Every angel constitutes a species by itself, but
nevertheless it belongs to one of the nine orders, and never
leaves it (cf. l. 91).  

	|91.  Incendio~ (the fiery ring) is the object of |seguiva.~

	|92.~  In ^Conv.~, II, vi, 38-39, Dante declares that the 
angels are `quasi innumerabili'; St. Thomas says as much in
^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. cxii, Art. 4.  Cf. Daniel vii, 10. 

	|93.  S' immilla~, `stretches into the thousands.' 
According to an old story, the inventor of the game of chess
asked of the King of Persia, as a reward, one grain of corn for
the first square, two for the second, four for the third, eight
for the fourth, and so on, with successive `doubling' through the
64 squares of the chess-board.  The result is a number of 20
figures.  The Proven$cal poets Peire Vidal and Folquet de
Marselha (cf. IX 94) refer to this tale. 

	|94.  Osannar~, `Hosannah sung.' 

	|95.  Ubi~ (Latin), `where,' i.e., spots.

	|100.  I suoi vimi~, `their bonds': the respective rings to
which they are bound. 

	|101.  Ponno~ = ^possono.~  Cf. 1 John iii, 2: `we shall be
like him; for we shall see him as he is.' 

	|102.  Sublimi~, `exalted.' 

	|103.  Vonno~ = ^vanno~: the form is still extant in Umbria.

	|105.~  `Therefore' (when God created the world) `they
closed the first triad.'  The Thrones, like the Cherubim and the
Seraphim, receive God within them.  |Terminonno~ = ^terminarono.~
-- The line is very obscure; but the idea seems to be that the
designation `Thrones' is appropriate because these angels form
the bottom of the highest set, the sovereign angels being (so to
speak) seated upon them.  According to Dionysius (^De Caelesti
Hierarchia~, VII, 1, end), the Thrones are so called because they
are remote from everything earthly, are close to the highest,
receive the divine advent without matter and without motion,
carry God, and are fit for divine offices. -- Cf. ^Par.~ IX,
61-63; ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. cviii, Art. 5. 

	|107.  Sua~, `their.' 

	|110.  Atto che vede~, `act of sight.' 

	|111.  Poscia seconda~, `follows after.' 

	|113.  Che~ (= ^mercede~, `desert') is the object of 
|partorisce~, of which |grazia~ and |buona voglia~ are subjects. 

	|114.~  These are the `steps': Grace begets good will, Grace
and good will constitute desert, desert determines the degree of
sight, and sight is the source of love.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 61-66;
^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. lxii, Art. 4. 

	|115.  Altro~, `second.' 

	|117.~  `Which no autumn ever strips.' `Nocturnal Aries'
means `autumn,' because in that season Aries is the constellation
opposite the sun. 

	|118.  Sberna~, `sings' (as a spring song). 

	|120.  Onde s' interna~, `which make it threefold.' 

	|121.  Dee~, `divinities': orders of angels. 

	|124.  Tripudi~, `dances': orders. 

	|128.  Vincon~, `prevail.' 

	|130.~  The great authority for the names, orders, and
functions of the angels is a Neo-Platonic work, not earlier than
the 5th century, ^De Caelesti Hierarchia~, attributed to
Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Paul's convert in Athens (mentioned
in Acts xvii, 34).  He was thought to have derived his
information from St. Paul, who had visited Paradise. 

	|133.~  St. Gregory, in his ^Moralia in Librum Beati Job~,
arranges the angelic orders thus: Seraphim, Cherubim, Powers;
Principalities, Virtues, Dominations; Thrones, Archangels,
Angels.  This sequence is followed by Brunetto Latini in the
^Tr$esor~, and by Dante in ^Conv.~, II, vi.  Elsewhere Gregory
has a still different arrangement.  See ^Bull.~, XVIII, 127 and
205. 

	|137.  Mortale~: Dionysius. 

	|138.  Chi~: St. Paul. -- |Vide~: 2 Cor. xii, 2-4.
