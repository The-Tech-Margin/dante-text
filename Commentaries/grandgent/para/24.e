	|1.  Sodalizio~, company. -- Cf. Luke xiv, 16, and Mat.
xxii, 14: `A certain man made a great supper and bade many' --
`many are called, but few are chosen.' 

	|2.~  Cf. Rev. xix, 9: `Blessed are they which are called
unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.'  The Paschal Lamb of the
Hebrews, slain and eaten at Easter time, became a symbol of
Christ. 

	|4.  Questi preliba~, `this man (Dante) foretastes.' 

	|8.  Roratelo~, `bedew him'; give him a few drops from the
fount of Truth, upon which his thought is bent. 

	|11.~  It is evident from l. 30 and from XXV, 14, that
|spere~ means `circles,' rings of spirits dancing in a round,
or carol. 

	|12.  Volte~, `revolving.'  Some texts have ^forte.~ 

	|13.  Cerchi~, `wheels.' -- |Tempra~, `escapement.' 

	|15.  Che voli~, `(seems) to fly.' 

	|16-18.~  The pace of the circling rings of dancers is a 
measure of their `wealth' of gladness. -- An adverb like 
^differentemente~ was originally a phrase made up of an
adjective and the ablative ^mente~; its composite nature long
continued to be felt. 

	|19.  Quella~: sc., ^carola.~ 

	|26-27.~  `For our imagination -- not to say our speech --
is too bright a color for such folds.'  Human speech and even
human memory are not profound enough to describe or retain an
impression of such depth of holiness.  The metaphor is taken
from the technique of painting (in ^V. N.~, XXXV, Dante appears
as an artist): pictures, in our poet's day, consisted mainly of
faces and garments, the latter falling in folds, and these
folds presented the deepest shades; skill was required to find
a color dark enough to portray them, while preserving the
purity of tone the Tuscans loved. 

	|28.  Ne prieghe~ = ^ci prieghi.~ 

	|30.  Mi disleghe~, `thou unloosest me' from the round. 

	|31.  Poscia~: first (ll. 22-23) the shining spirit
circles about Beatrice and sings, `then' it stops and speaks
the words just cited. 

	|34.  Viro~ (Latin ^vir~), `man.' 

	|35.~  Cf. XXIII, 139. 

	|36.~  `Of this wondrous delight' depends on `the keys' in
l. 35. 

	|37.  Tenta~, `test,' examine. 

	|39.~  Through faith Peter `walked on the water, to go to 
Jesus': Mat. xiv, 25-29. 

	|41.  Viso~, `sight.' -- |Quivi~, `there': in God. 

	|43.  Civi~, `citizens.' 

	|44.  A gloriarla~, `in order to glorify it' (faith). 

	|45.~  `It is well that he (Dante) be called upon to speak
of it.'  |Arrivi~ is equivalent to ^tocchi~, `befall.' 

	|46.~  To receive the degree of Doctor in Theology, a
bachelor had to discuss a thesis propounded by a Master. -- Cf.
1 Peter, iii, 15.  The bachelor, having been questioned,
defends his case (the master presiding), then the master goes
over the case and gives his decision (^determinatio): Studi
danteschi~, VI, 141-142.  

	|48.~  The candidate `arms himself to argue' the question,
`not to decide it': that belongs to the Master. 

	|51.  Querente~, `questioner.' 

	|54.  In~, `toward.' -- |Questo~: these words. 

	|57.~  Cf. John vii, 38. 

	|58.  Ch' io mi confessi~, `that I be confessed.' 

	|59.  Da l' alto primopilo~, `by the high commander': St.
Peter, the first commander of the Church.  Note that
^primopilus~ is the title of a Roman military officer. 

	|61.  Stilo~, `pen': Hebrews xi, 1. 

	|62.~  Cf. 2 Peter iii, 15: `our beloved brother Paul.' --
|Del tuo caro frate~ depends on ^stilo~ in l. 61. 

	|63.~  `Who, with thee, brought Rome into the right line'
-- into the path of Christianity. 

	|66.  Quiditate~, `essence.' 

	|67.  Senti~, `thou thinkest.' 

	|68.  La ripuose~, `he (Paul) placed it (faith).' 

	|71.~  `Which here (in Heaven) allow themselves to be seen
by me.' 

	|73.~  `That their existence is there to be found only in 
belief.' 

	|75.  Prende intenza~, `it assumes the concept': it falls
into the category.  |Intenza~ is the scholastic Latin
^intentio~, `notion' or `concept'; English ^intention~ has
often been used in this sense. 

	|77.  Sillogizzar~, `argue.' -- |Vista~, `proof. 

	|78.~  `Therefore it contains the idea of evidence.' 

	|81.~  `The sophist's wit would have no place there.' --
|Li~ = ^vi.~ 

	|83.  Trascorsa~, `inspected.' 

	|84.  Lega~, `composition.' 

	|87.  Conio~, `stamp.' -- |S' inforsa~, `is dubious.' 

	|89.  Gioia~, `jewel.' 

	|90.~  Romans xiv, 23: `for whatsoever is not of faith is
sin.'  Cf. Hebrews xi, 6: `But without faith it is impossible
to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he
is.' 

	|91.  Ploia~, `rain': inspiration. 

	|93.  Cuoia~, `parchments': Testaments. 

	|95.  Inverso di~, `compared to.' 

	|98.  Proposizion~, `premise': the two Testaments are the 
premises from which the conclusion is deduced. 

	|101.  Opere seguite~, `works that followed': the
miracles, which cannot be explained as products of nature. 

	|104-105.  Quel medesmo~ etc., `the very thing that is to 
be proved (the revealed Truth), and naught else, is thy voucher

for it.'  St. Peter, wishing, as examiner, to draw out Dante
more fully, tells him that he is arguing in a circle. 

	|106-108.~  If the world was converted to Christianity 
without the miracles related in the Bible, this conversion was 
itself a far greater miracle, and quite sufficient proof of 
divine intervention.  The argument is taken from St. Augustine,
^De Civitate Dei~, XXII, v: `hoc nobis unum grande miraculum 
sufficit, quod...terrarum orbis sine ullis miraculis credidit.'
St. Thomas also, ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei~, I, vi,
discourses on the miracle of the conversion of the world to
Christianity. 

	|113.  Spere~, `rings.' -- |Dio laudamo~: cf. ^Purg.~ IX,
140. 

	|115.  Baron~, `lord': St. Peter. 

	|118.  Donnea~, `holds amorous converse.' 

	|121.  Emerse~, `has issued.' 

	|124-126.~  St. Peter now sees in God that which on earth
he accepted through faith.  This faith was so strong that it
impelled him to enter the Sepulchre before John, although the
younger disciple reached it first: John xx, 3-8.  Cf. ^Mon.~,
III, ix, 111-114. 

	|128.  Forma~, `essence.' 

	|129.  La cagion di lui~, `its cause.' 

	|134.~  St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologigae~, Prima, Qu. ii,
Art. 3, gives five physical and metaphysical proofs of the
existence of God: the impossibility of explaining the world
without the assumption of a first motor, of a first efficient
cause, of a first necessity, of a first goodness, of a first
governing intelligence.  In Prima, Qu. 1, Art. 5, he tells us
that theology makes use of philosophy. -- |Dalmi~ = ^me lo
d@a~: the subject is ^verit@a~ in l. 135. 

	|136.~  Luke xxiv, 44: `These are the words which I spake
unto you,...that all things must be fulfilled, which were
written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the
psalms, concerning me.' 

	|137.  Voi~: the Apostles. 

	|138.  Almi~, `reverend.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 20. 

	|141.  Soffera~, `it admits.'  We may use with `Trinity'
the verb `are' or the verb `is.' -- |Este~ for ^@e~ is not
uncommon in early Italian. 

	|143.  Mente~ is the object of ^sigilla~, `stamps.' 

	|144.~  Various passages in the Bible are cited in support
of the doctrine of the Trinity: Mat. xxviii, 19; 2 Cor. xiii,
14; 1 Peter i, 2; 1 John v, 7 (`For there are three that bear
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and
these three are one'). 

	|148.  I~ = ^gli~: cf. ^Inf.~ XXII, 73. 

	|152.  Cinse~, `encircled.'  The subject is ^lume~ in l. 
153. 

	|154.~  Cf. Jeremiah ix, 24: `But let him that glorieth
glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
the Lord.'
