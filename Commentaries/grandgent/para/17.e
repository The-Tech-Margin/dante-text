	|1-3.~  Eager to learn from his heavenly ancestor something
about his kin, Dante compares himself to Pha,ethon, the son of
Apollo and Clymene, who, having been told that the god was not
really his father, went to his mother to find out the truth:
^Met.~, I, 748-756.  For the accentuation of ^Climen@e~, cf.
^Inf.~ V, 4, and XXX, 2. -- The example of Pha,ethon still makes
fathers cautious in granting their sons' requests, because of the
tragic results of Apollo's indulgence, when he allowed Pha,ethon
to drive the chariot of the sun: ^Met.~, II, 31-328. 

	|5.  Lampa~: the light of Cacciaguida. 

	|11.  Perch@e t' ausi~, `to accustom thyself.' 

	|12.  Lt' uom ti mesca~, `one may give thee drink.' 

	|13.  Piota~, `sole': i.e., foundation.  A word used by 
Jacopone da Todi.  In ^Giorn. dant.~, XXIV, 92, there is an 
argument for reading ^pianta~ for |piota.~ 

	|14-16.~  The blest see even `contingent,' or casual, things
-- whether they be past, present, or future -- as clearly as
`earthly minds' can grasp an eternal, concrete, elementary fact,
-- as for instance the geometrical proposition that `two obtuse
angles cannot be contained in a triangle.'  Cf. Aristotle,
^Metaphysics~, IX, x. 

	|17-18.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xiv, Art. 13. 

	|24.  Tetragono~, `foursquare': Aristotle, ^Ethics~, I, x;
^Rhetoric~, III, xi, 2.  See ^Giorn. dant.~, XXI, 264; XXII, 40. 

	|27.~  `An arrow foreseen comes slower' -- i.e., strikes us
with a less violent shock.  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda 
Secundae, Qu. cxxxiii, Art. 9: `jacula quae praevidentur minus
feriunt' (quoted from Gregory).  See also ^Giorn. Stor.~, LXXII,
192. 

	|31.~  `In no ambiguous terms,' such as heathen prophets
used in order to ensnare the `foolish folk.'  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 99:
`Horrendas canit ambages.'  See P. Rajna in ^Studi danteschi~, I,
93. 

	|33.~  John i, 29: `Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.' 

	|37.~  `Contingency' is the whole sequence of casual events,
as distinguished from the eternal and inevitable. -- |Quaderno~,
`volume.'  Cf. XV, 50. -- Contingency, or casualty, is confined
to the world of matter. 

	|40-42.~  `But it (contingency) does not derive
inevitability therefrom (from being foreseen by God) any more
than a boat going downstream derives inevitability from the eye
in which it is mirrored.'  Casual things are no more necessary
from being anticipated by omniscience than they would be if there
were no power to see them coming.  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima,
Qu. xxi, Art. 4. 

	|46-47.~  Hippolytus was driven from Athens by the false 
accusation of his stepmother, Phaedra.  Cf. ^Met.~, XV, 493-505
(`sceleratae fraude novercae,' l. 498). 

	|50.  Verr@a fatto a chi~, `will be brought to pass by him
who' -- by Pope Boniface VIII.  Apparently the exile of Dante 
and other opponents of the Papal policy was planned in Rome in 
April, 1300, two months before Dante's priorate. 

	|51.~  The place `where Christ is bought and sold every day'
is Rome. 

	|52.  Colpa~, `blame.' -- |Offensa~ (= ^offesa~), `wronged.'
-- Cf. ^Cons.~, I, Pr. iv, end: `Quo fit ut existimatio bona
prima omnium deserat infelices.' 

	|53.  Vendetta~: many regarded the disgrace and death of 
Boniface VIII as a divine punishment for his cruelty and
ambition.  Cf. Dino Compagni, ^Cronica~, II, xxxv; G. Villani,
^Croniche~, VIII, lxiv. 

	|58.  Sa~, `tastes.' 

	|62.  Compagnia~: the Whites, Dante's fellow-exiles. -- Cf.
Ecclus. viii, 18-20. 

	|63.  Valle~: vale of tears, misery. 

	|66.  Avr@a rossa la tempia~, `shall have its brows red,'
i.e., shall blush with shame for its folly. 

	|71.  Gran Lombardo~: the head of the great house of the 
Scaligeri, or della Scala family, of Verona. 

	|72.~  The Scaligeri had as their armorial bearings a
ladder, to which was added, at the top, an Imperial eagle. 

	|76.  Colui~: Can Grande. 

	|77.  Questa stella~: Mars. 

	|82.~  Before 1312, when the Gascon Pope, Clement V, after
promising to support the Emperor, Henry VII, in his expedition to
Italy, promoted opposition to it.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 83; ^Par.~
XXX, 133-148. 

	|84.~  Indifference to wealth and to peril is a
characteristic of `magnanimity': ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda
Secundae, Qu. cxxix, Art. 8, end. 

	|93.  Che fien presente~ (= ^presenti~), `who shall be 
witnesses.' 

	|97-99.~  Dante's life extended long beyond the miserable
end of Boniface and of Corso Donati (^Purg.~ XXIV, 82-87).  The
latter was a `neighbor' in the strictest sense of the word.  It
may be, however, that l. 98 refers to Dante's enduring fame,
rather than to his bodily existence. 

	|100-102.~  `When, by its silence, the blessed soul showed
that it had finished putting the woof upon the web which I had
given it warped.'  Cacciaguida had embroidered his answer upon
the canvas of Dante's question. 

	|108.  Pi@u s' abbandona~, `is most heedless.' 

	|110.  Loco~: Florence. 

	|111.  Carmi~, `verses.' 

	|117.  Agrume~, `sourness.' 

	|124.  Fusca~, `darkened.' 

	|126.~  `Will indeed deem thy speech harsh.' 

	|129.  Rogna~, `itch.' -- Dante chose to write his poem in
the `comic' rather than the `tragic' style, that he might, when
occasion required, sacrifice elegance to vigor. 

	|130-132.~  Cf. ^Cons.~, III, Pr. i: `...ut degustata quidem
mordeant, interius autem recepta dulcescant.' 

	|135.  Argomento~, `proof': because it requires exceptional
courage to `strike the highest peaks.' 

	|138.  Pur~, `only.'  The statement was perhaps
approximately true for Dante's first readers. 

	|139-142.~  The listener is never satisfied nor convinced by
an unkown example or an obscure argument. -- |Aia~ = ^abbia.~
