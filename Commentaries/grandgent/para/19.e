	|2.  Che~ is the object of ^facevan~ in l. 3. -- |Frui~ (a
Latin infinitive used as a noun), `fruition.' 

	|7.  Testeso~, `now.'

not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
man...'  

	|13.  Per esser~, `for being.' 

	|15.~  `Which cannot be surpassed by desire.' 

	|28-29.~  The angelic order of the Thrones, which reflects
God's judgments, presides over the sphere of Saturn.  Cf. IX,
61-62. 

	|34.  Cappello~, `hood.'

	|44.  Verbo~: conception, idea.  Cf. XVIII, 1.  See ^Summa
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xxxii, Art. 1: `per verbum intelligitur
ratio idealis, per quam Deus omnia condidit.' 

	|45.  In infinito eccesso~, `infinitely greater' than the 
realization.  Cf. XIII, 52-78.  God's ideal conception is
infinite, while the created universe is finite. 

	|46.~  `And a proof of this (the inferiority of every
created thing to the creative mind) is that the first proud one
(Lucifer)...' 

	|48.~  `Fell unripe, because he would not wait for light.' 
Without grace, it is impossible for any created mind to see God
in his essence (cf. XIV, 48); but Lucifer and his companions in
pride, rejecting the grace that was offered them immediately upon
their creation, tried by their own powers to penetrate God and to
become like him.  Cf. ^Vulg. El.~, I, ii: `divinam curam perversi
expectare noluerunt.'  See ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu.
lxii-lxiii.

	|56.  Che suo~ etc., `as not to discern its origin (the
divine Mind)...' 

	|57.~  `Far beyond all that it (our vision) can see.'  Our
intelligence, a product of the intelligence of God, has just
power enough to understand how far beyond the range of its
comprehension its divine Source lies. 

	|58-60.~  Earthly intelligence, then, can no more penetrate
eternal justice than a human eye can penetrate the ocean.  Cf.
Ps. xxxvi, 6: `thy judgments are a great deep.' 

	|61.  Proda~, `shore.' 

	|62.  In pelago~, `on the main.' 

	|63.~  `It (the bottom) is there, but its depth conceals
it.'  |Gli~ = ^l@i.~ 

	|64.  Lume non~ @e, `there is no light.' 

	|66.~  Without grace, all that we take to be light is
darkness, either the shadow or the poison of the flesh -- either
ignorance or vice. 

	|67.  Latebra~, `hiding-place.' 

	|69.  Facei~ = ^facevi.~ -- |Crebra~, `frequent.'

	|82.~  `Surely, for him who sophisticates with me...'  Dante
is putting subtle questions about justice to the Eagle, who is
its embodiment. 

	|83.~  If you mortals had not the Bible and its clear
utterances to guide you, there would be no end to your
sophistries, since even with the Bible you enter into such
discussions. 

	|84.~  `There would be a wonderful chance for questioning.' 

	|85.~  Cf. ^Cons.~, III, Pr. iii: `Vos quoque, O terrena 
animalia.' 

	|87.~  Cf. Malachi iii, 6: `For I am the Lord, I change not.

	|89.~  `No created goodness draws it (the divine will) to
itself.' 

	|90.  tui cagiona~, `causes it (the ^creato bene~).'

^la cicogna~, to be supplied from l. 92. 

	|100.  Poi~ = ^poi che.~ 

	|104.~  For the third time we have |Cristo~ in rime with 
itself: cf. XII, 71.  See also XIV, where the riming lines are 
the same as in this canto: 104, 106, 108. 

	|105.  Vel~ (Latin), `either'... `or.' 

	|106.~  Mat. vii, 22-23. 

	|107.  Prope~ (Latin), `near.'

	|118.  Sovra Senna~, `on the Seine': in France. 

	|119.~  Philip the Fair, to supply himself with money after
the battle of Courtray in 1302, debased the coinage of the realm,
causing great misery.  Cf. A. Franco, ^Numismatica dantesca~,
1903 (^Bull.~, XI, 263). 

	|120.~  Philip died in 1314 from a fall occasioned by a wild
boar which ran between his horse's legs: cf. G. Villani,
^Croniche~, IX, lxv.  |Colpo di cotenna~, `boarskin blow,' is an 
odd phrase: the king's death was due, not to the tusks of the
boar, but to its bristly hide brushing against the horse. 

	|121.  Asseta~, `quickens thirst.' 

	|123.  Soffrir~, `endure,' keep. -- |Sua meta~, `his
bounds.' -- The first part of the 14th century saw the wars of
Edward I and Edward II against the Scotch under Wallace and
Bruce. 

	|125.  Quel di Spagna~: Ferdinand IV of Castile. -- |Quel di
Boemme~: Wenceslaus IV (^Purg.~ VII, 101).  |Boemme~ (a common
form in Dante's time) = ^Boemia~, `Bohemia.' 

	|127.~  Charles II of Naples, titular King of Jerusalem, was
called `the Cripple' on account of his lameness. 

	|128-129.~  His goodness will be marked 1, his wickedness 
1000.  He seems to have had no virtue except liberality: cf.
VIII, 82; ^Purg.~ XX, 79. 

	|131.~  Frederick of Aragon, King of Sicily: cf. ^Purg.~
VII, 119; ^Conv.~, IV, vi, 182; ^Vulg. El.~, I, xii, 37.  After
warring for some years with Charles of Naples, he made peace with
him and married his daughter.  Upon the death of Emperor Henry
VII, he abandoned the Ghibelline cause. 

	|132.  Aen.~, III, 707-715. 

	|133-135.~  To indicate at the same time his insignificance
and his wickedness, his many misdeeds shall be recorded in
shorthand. 

	|137.  Barba~, `uncle': James, King of Majorca and Minorca.
-- |Fratel~: James II of Aragon.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII, 119. 

	|138.  Nazione~, `birth.' -- |Fatte bozze~, `dishonored.' 

	|139.~  Concerning Dionysius of Portugal and Hakon of
Norway, Dante probably knew little. 

	|140.  Si conosceranno~, `shall be revealed.' -- Rascia was
a state made up of parts of Servia, Bosnia, Croatia, and
Dalmatia.  Its king in 1300 was a certain Stephen Ouros, who
counterfeited the Venetian ducat. 

	|142.~  The throne of Hungary, which belonged to Charles
Martel (VIII, 64-66), was usurped by Andrew III. 

	|144.~  Navarre would be happy if she could protect herself
with the mountain chains that enfold her -- that is, if she could
make the Pyrenees a bulwark against France, which is destined to
annex her on the death of her queen, Joanna, married to Philip
the Fair. 

	|145-147.~  We may regard as a `foretaste' and a warning of
these great disasters the misfortunes of a couple of towns in 
Cyprus, which are already bewailing and scolding about their 
`beast,' the dissolute King of Cyprus, Henry II of Lusignan. 

	|148.~  This little beast trots along beside the big ones on
the path of crime.
