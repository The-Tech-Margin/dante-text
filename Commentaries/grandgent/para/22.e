	|37-39.~  On the summit of Monte Cassino, in the Kingdom of
Naples, St. Benedict in 528 erected two chapels in a temple of
Apollo, and converted the heathen; there arose the first and most
famous monastery of his order.  Cf. St Gregory the Great,
^Dialogi~, II, viii. -- |Gente~: the pagan people. 

	|42.  Sublima~, `exalts.' 

	|49.  Maccario~: probably St. Macarius of Alexandria, a
disciple of St. Antony and a promoter of monasticism in the East.
He died in 405. -- |Romoaldo~: St. Romualdus of Ravenna, 
dissatisfied with the laxity into which the Benedictines had 
fallen, founded in 1012 the order of Camaldoli.  Cf. the ^Ermo~ 
of ^Purg.~ V, 96.  His life was written by St. Peter Damian (XXI,
121). 

	|60.~  This would seem to be an appropriate place for such
a wish: ^Giorn. dant.~, XXIII, 228. 

	|62.  L' ultima spera~: the Empyrean, or real Heaven.

appears in the Italian of Chiaro Davanzati: `Gitto a mio danno lo

	|77.~  Cf. Isaiah vii, 11: `Is this house, which is called
by my name, become a den of robbers (^spelunca latronum~) in your
eyes?'  Mat. xxi, 13: `My house shall be called the house of
prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.' -- |Cocolle~,

	|90.  Francesco~: St. Francis of Assisi (XI). 

	|93.  Del bianco~ etc., `the white turned dark,' like a

     `Que tost chai 
     Blancs en bai, 
     Com flors sobre lenha.' 

	|94.  Veramente~, `nevertheless.' -- `Jordan turned back':
Joshua, iii, 14-17. 

	|95.  Pi@u~ is to be connected with ^mirabile~ in l. 96. --
`And the sea fleeing': Exod. xiv, 21-29. -- |Volse~ = ^volle.~ 

	|96.~  The turning back of the Jordan and the parting of the
Red Sea were examples of divine intervention `more wonderful to
behold than succor here.'  Therefore we must not despair.  Cf.
Ps. cxiv (Vulg. cxiii), 3 and 5: `The sea saw it, and fled:
Jordan was driven back.'...`What ailed thee, O thou sea, that
thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?' 

	|98.  Si strinse~, `closed together.' 

	|99.  Turbo~, `whirlwind,' cyclone. 

	|106.  S' io torni mai~, `as I hope ever to return.' -- 
|Lettore~: Scart. notes that this is the last of Dante's sixteen
apostrophes to the `reader.' 

	|108.~  Cf. Luke xviii, 13: `the publican...smote upon his
breast ^percutiebat pectus suum).'~ 

	|109-110.~  `Thou wouldst not have drawn out and put thy 
finger in the fire so quickly as I saw the sign.'  The order of 
the two acts is inverted (as in II, 23-24) to give the impression
of simultaneousness. -- |Segno~: Gemini (the Twins) the sign that
follows Taurus (the Bull) in the zodiac.  Dante has risen to the
heaven of the fixed stars. 

	|113.  Dal quale io riconosco~, `to which I owe': cf. XXIX,
59, XXXI, 84. -- Gemini, the house of Mercury, bestows a taste
for learning. 

	|115-117.~  The sun was rising and setting with Gemini when
Dante first breathed `the Tuscan air': he was born, then, between
May 21 and June 21. -- |Vosco~, `with you.' 

	|121-123.~  Entering upon the third stage of his celestial
journey, Dante invokes the aid of his native constellation for
the `difficult pass' that is drawing him on -- namely, the
description of the higher heavens.  This appeal, one of Dante's
most charming inventions, stands in line with the preludes in I,
1-36, and X, 1-27.  Here, however, he calls, not on Apollo, but
on his own stars. 

	|125.  Dei~ = ^devi.~ 

	|126.  Luci~, `eyes.' 

	|127.  T' inlei~, `enter into it' (the ^salute~).  The verb
is made by Dante from the pronoun ^lei~: cf. ^inluia~ in IX, 73;
^intuassi~ and ^inmii~ in IX, 81. 

	|129.  Fei~ = ^feci.~ 

	|132.  Etera~, `ether.'

`other things' than `this globe.'  Cf. Leopardi, ^La ginestra~,
167 ff. 

	|138.  Probo~, `righteous.' 

	|139.~  `Latona's daughter' is Diana, the moon. 

	|140.~  The upper side of the moon (Dante says) has no dark
spots. 

	|141.~  See II, 49-60. 

	|142.~  Hyperion is often called by ancient poets the father
of the sun.  See ^Met.~, IV, 192: `Hyperione nate' (cf. 241). 

	|143.  Com si move~, `what motion there is,' how the planets
move. 

	|144.  Lui~: the sun. -- |Maia~ and |Dione~ are probably to
be taken as vocatives like ^Iperione~ in l. 142.  These persons
are invoked, because, like Hyperion, they are parents of gods
whose names are borne by heavenly bodies: Maia is the mother of
Mercury; Dione, the mother of Venus.  Cf. ^Theb.~, II, 1 (`Maia
satus') and ^Aen.~, I, 297 (`Maia genitum'); ^Par.~ VIII, 7. 

	|145.  Temperar~: see XVIII, 68. 

	|146.  Padre~: Saturn. -- |Figlio~: Mars. 

	|150.  Riparo~, `abode.' 

	|151.  Aiuola~, `little threshing-floor': the inhabited part
of the earth.  Cf.  ^area~ in ^Cons.~, II, pr. ii.
