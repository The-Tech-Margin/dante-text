	|3.  La notte~, `during the night.' 

	|5.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, XII, 475: `Pabula parva legens nidisque 
loquacibus escas.' 

	|6.  Aggrati~, `a pleasure.' 

	|7.  Previene il tempo~, `anticipates the hour.' 

	|9.  Pur che~ etc., `only for dawn to break.' 

	|11.  Plaga~, `quarter': the sky overhead. 

	|12.~  In the middle of the sky the sun seems to move slower
than it does near the horizon. 

	|13.  Vaga~, `eager.' 

	|15.~  `Would fain have something, and is soothed by hope.' 

	|16.  Quando~: moment. 

	|19-21.~  The blest were predisposed to virtue by the
heavens which influenced them at birth; and salvation was made
possible by Christ. 

	|24.  Costrutto~, `phrasing.'  Cf. XII, 67. 

	|26.~  Trivia is one of the names of Diana: the moon.  Dante
apparently pronounced the name ^Triv$ia.~ -- |Ninfe~: the stars. 

	|27.  Seni~, `laps,' confines.  Cf. XIII, 7. 

	|30.~  Christ illumines all the blest, just as our material
sun illumines all the stars -- `the phenomena on high' (cf. II,
115).  See ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 125-126: `del suo lume tutte le
altre stelle s'informano.'  Cf. ^Par.~ XX:, 6. -- A. Santi,
^Giorn. dant.~, XXII, 229, attempts to show that in Dante's
belief the light of the stars does not come entirely from the
sun.  We find that both opinions were current in the Middle Ages.

	|32.  Sustanza~: the humanity of Christ. 

	|35.  Sobranza~: cf. XX, 97. 

	|37.~  See 1 Cor. i, 24: `Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God.'  Usually Christ is identified with Wisdom. 

	|38.~  See Hebrews x, 20: `a new and living way, which he 
hath consecrated for us.' 

	|41.  Per dilatarsi~, `expanding.'  Cf. Ristoro d' Arezzo,
^Della Composizione del Mondo~, II, vii, 2. 

	|42.  Fuor di~, `contrary to.'  It is the nature of fire to
rise: cf. I, 115; ^Conv.~, III, iii, 11-13. 

	|43.  Dape~, `viands.' 

	|45.  Che si fesse~, `what it became.' 

	|47.  Che~, `such that.' 

	|49.  Si risente~, `is reminded.' 

	|51.  Ridurlasi~ = ^ridursela.~ 

	|53.  Grato~, `gratitude.' 

	|54.  Rassegna~, `records.' 

	|55-57.~  `Polyhymnia and her sisters' are the Muses, who 
nourish (or `fatten') the tongues of poets.  Dante evidently 
pronounced ^Polimn$ia.~ -- In a sequence of St. James, found in
a 14th-century manuscript (F. J. Mone, ^Lateinische Hymnen des 
Mittelalters~, p. 107, No. 700, ll. 21-22), we read: 

     `Vas sincerum, granum pingue 
     Bibit lac coelestis linguae.' 

	|60.  Facea mero~, `it (the smile) lighted up' the face of
Beatrice.

	|62.  Poema~ is the subject of |saltar.~

1-9. 

	|69.  Parca~, `would spare.' 

	|70.~  Cf. XVIII, 21. 

	|73.  Rosa~: Mary, the `Mystic Rose.'  Series of prayers to
the Virgin were named ^rosaria.~ -- |Verbo~: Christ. -- Cf. John
i, 14: `And the Word was made flesh.' 

	|74.  Gigli~: the Apostles.  In his unfinished commentary 
on Isaiah, St. Thomas discusses the resemblance of saints to 
lilies: see G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l' ordine del `Paradiso'
dantesco~, I, 1911, 128-129. 

	|75.  A~, `by.' -- See 2 Cor. ii, 14: `Now thanks be unto
God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh
manifest the ^savour~ of his knowledge by us in every place' --
`^odorem~ notitiae suae manifestat per nos.' 

	|78.  Cigli~: `brows,' for `eyes.' 

	|79-81.~  `As ere now my eyes, covered by a shadow, have
seen a flowery meadow under a sunbeam that streams clear through
a rifted cloud': an exceedingly beautiful simile used to describe
the vast throngs of flowerlike souls illumined from above by the
dazzling light of Christ, who has risen once again to the
Empyrean, in order that Dante's own eyes may not be entirely
blinded by his brightness. 

	|84.  Principio~, `source': Christ. 

	|85.  Li 'mprenti~, `dost mark them.' 

	|88.  Nome~: the mention of Mary in l. 73.  Among the bright
lights, hers is now the greatest (l. 90). 

	|91.  Come~, `when.' -- |Luci~, `eyes.' -- The subject of 
|dipinse~ is the phrase in l.  92. 

	|92.  Il quale e il quanto~, `the quality and bigness.' 

	|94.~  The `torch' is perhaps the Archangel Gabriel, the 
messenger of the Annunciation.  He now forms a circling halo 
around the head of the Virgin.  For a different interpretation, 
see ^Modern Language Notes~, XLII, 305; for another, see M.
Porena, ^La mia Lectura Dantis~, 1932, 348. 

	|99.~  Cf. ^Met.~, XII, 51-52: 

     `qualemve sonum, cum Juppiter atras 
     Increpuit nubes, extrema tonitrua reddunt.' 

	|101.~  The `sapphire' is Mary.  This gem, besides being
precious and beautiful, possesses a beneficent power. 

	|103.  Giro~, `encircle.' 

	|104.  Ventre~, `womb.' 

	|106.  Mentre~, `until': until Mary shall rise to the
Empyrean, following Christ. 

	|107.  Dia~, `divine.' 

	|108.  Perch@e gli entre~ (= ^vi entri~), `by entering it.' 

	|110.  Si sigillava~, `sealed itself,' i.e., ended. 

	|112.~  `The royal cloak of all the revolutions of the
world' is the Empyrean, which surrounds all the revolving
spheres.  For |volumi~, cf. XXVI, 119, XXVIII, 14; also ^Met.~,
II, 71. 

	|114.  Costumi~ (sc., ^di Dio~), `ways.' 

	|115.  Interna riva~, `inner bank.'  Even the lowest edge of
the Empyrean is far beyond the reach of Dante's eye. 

	|120.  Semenza~: Christ, the `seed' or child of Mary. 

	|123.~  `Because of the spirit (of grateful love) which
breaks even into external flame' -- which, in default of words,
finds expression in a gesture. -- This figure reveals the same
tender recollection of family life that we find in Dante's other
references to children. 

	|124.~  All the bright souls -- the `whitenesses' -- extend
their flames upward after Mary. 

	|128.  Regina caeli~: an antiphon sung in the office of the
Virgin after Easter.  `O Queen of Heaven, rejoice, for he whom
thou wert worthy to bear rose as he promised; pray to God for us. 
Hallelujah!' 

	|130.  Ubert@a~, `plenty.' -- |Si soffolce~, `is stored.' 

	|131.  Arche~, `bins': the blessed souls. 

	|132.  Bobolce~, `husbandmen.'  They are now filled with the
good which they sowed on earth.  Cf. Galatians vi, 7: `whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' 

	|134-135.~  The `exile of Babylon' is the earthly life.  Cf.
Ps. cxxxvii (Vulg.  cxxxvi), 1: `By the rivers of Babylon, there
we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.' -- On earth
`they forsook gold,' following the precept of Jesus in Mat. xix,
21: `If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.' --
Some editors, in l. 135, read ^egli lasci@o~ and make St. Peter
the subject of ll. 133-135, as well as 136-139. 

	|137.  Di sua vittoria~, `by his victory.' 

	|138.~  In company with the souls of the Old and the New 
Covenant.  Prophets and Apostles preached the same faith. 

	|139.  Colui~ (St. Peter) is the subject of ^triunfa~ in l.
136. -- Cf. Mat. xvi, 19: `And I will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven.'
