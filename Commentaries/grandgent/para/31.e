	|1.~  The figure of the rose seems to be Dante's own,
although Paradise is sometimes represented in rose-like form in 
early Italian art.  The rose, too, was sometimes used as a symbol
of the Passion.  On the fourth Sunday of Lent, the Pope blesses
a gold rose (`rosa aurea mixta cum balsamo et musco'), with a 
ceremonial that indicates an association of this flower with 
Christ and Heaven: see G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l' ordine del
`Paradiso' dantesco~, I, 1911 233-238.  The Old French ^Roman de
la Rose~, the great literary success of the 13th century, made 
all western Europe familiar with the rose as a symbol of earthly
love; Dante's white flower is the rose of Heavenly love.  It may
be that a sight of the Roman Coliseum influenced his conception 
of the great amphitheatre of Paradise (cf. Busnelli, I, 239-242).
The figure of the rose is also an homage to Mary, who presides in
the assembly.  See Albertus Magnus, ^De laud. b. Mariae
Virginis~, XII, iv, 33: `Et nota, quod Christus rosa, Maria rosa.
Ecclesia rosa, fidelis anima rosa.' 

	|2.~  Cf. XXX, 43. 

	|4.  L' altra~ (sc., ^milizia~): the angels. 

	|7.  S' infiora~, `enflowers itself': dips into flowers. 

	|9.  L@a~: to the hive. -- |S' insapora~, `turns savory.' 

	|13.~  Cf. Ezekiel i, 13: `their appearance was like living
coals of fire.' 

	|14.~  Cf. Daniel x, 5 (`whose loins were girded with fine
gold') and vii 9 (`whose garment was white as snow'); also Song
of Solomon v, 10 and 11: `My beloved is white and ruddy'...`His
head is as the most fine gold.'  The angels embody love, purity,
and faith.  Cf. the figure of the Griffin in ^Purg.~ xxix,
113-114. 

	|18.  Ventilando il fianco~, `by fanning their sides': i.e.,
by flapping their wings as they flew upward. 

	|24.  Ostante~, `an obstacle.' 

	|26.  Frequente~, `abounding.' -- |Gente~ etc.: members of
the Old (Hebrew) and the New (Christian) Church. 

	|27.  Ad un segno~, `directed at one mark.' 

	|29.  Appaga~ = ^appaghi~, `dost satisfy.'  It is not
certain whether we have in |appaga ~ a third person used for the
second or a relic of the original form of the second person
singular. 

	|31-33.~  The `zone' that is always `covered by Helice' is
the North.  The nymph Helice or Callisto was transformed into 
the constellation of the Great Bear, and her son Arcas or Bootes
into the Little Bear: ^Met.~, II, 496-530, especially 515-517; 
cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 131.  The Bears, or Dippers, are close to the 
North Star: cf. Canzone XV, 28-29. -- |Ond' ell' @e vaga~, `whom
she loves.' 

	|34.  L' ardua sua opra~, `her lofty architecture.' 

	|35.  Stupefaciensi~ = ^si stupefacevano.~ -- The `Lateran'
is the old Papal palace in Rome: cf. ^Inf.~:XXVII, 86.  According
to tradition, it was given to St. Sylvester by Emperor
Constantine (cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 94-95), and became the seat of
Christian dominion.  Less than a century later, the barbarians
invaded Rome.  

	|36.  And@o di sopra~, `surpassed.' 

	|39.~  This phrase, the climax of the tiercet, is Dante's 
last and bitterest fling at Florence. 

	|41.  Tra esso e il gaudio~, `it (my amazement) and my joy
together.' 

	|42.  Libito~, `a pleasure.' 

	|43.  Ricrea~, `refreshes.' 

	|44.  Voto~, `vow': the shrine which he has vowed to visit. 

	|45.  Ridir~: to tell the people at home. -- |Stea~ =
^stia.~ 

	|49.~  `I saw faces conducive to love.' 

	|50.  Di suo~, `with their own.' 

	|58.  Uno intendea~, `I meant one thing. -- |Altro~,
`something else.' 

	|59.  Sene~ (Latin ^senex~), `Elder.'  For the
characteristics of ^senio~, or old age, see ^Conv.~, IV, xxviii.
This elder is St. Bernard, founder of the Abbey of Clairvaux in
Champagne, a great preacher and mystic of the first half of the
12th century, famous for his ardent devotion to the Blessed
Virgin.  It was he who preached the second crusade.  One of his
works is cited in Epistola X, xxviii, 555. 

	|60.  Vestito con~, `clad like': cf. ^Purg.~ XXIX, 145-146. 

	|67-68.~  Beatrice's own seat is `in the third row from the
top tier.'  The 1st row is that of Mary, the 2d that of Eve, the
3d that of Rachel, beside whom Beatrice sits: see ^Inf.~ II, 102;
^Par.~ XXXII, 8-9.  Contemplation and Revelation sit side by
side.  The number 3 (as well as the number 9) has always been
mysteriously associated with Beatrice: see ^V. N.~, XXX.  Cf. 
^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. lxxx, Art. 4: `in
tertio vero gradu ponitur absoluta consideratio intelligibilium
in quae per sensibilia pervenitur.' 

	|71.~  The significance of the halo, or crown of the blest,
is discussed by St.  Thomas in ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia,
Suppl., Qu. xcvi. 

	|73-75.~  An `eye' at the very bottom of the sea `is not 
so far away' from the top of the earth's atmosphere -- the
`region that thunders highest up' (cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 43-57, and
XXXII, 111). 

	|77.  Effige~, `image.' 

	|78.  Per mezzo mista~, `blurred by anything between.' 

	|79.  Vige~, `is strong.' 

	|81.~  See ^Inf.~ II, 52-93; ^Purg.~ XXX, 139-141. 

	|82.~  It should be noted that this particular phrase
depends on ^grazia~ and ^virtute~ in l. 84. 

	|83-84.~  `I owe the grace and efficacy...to thy power and
goodness.'  For |riconosco~, cf. XXII, 113, XXIX, 59. 

	|85.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu.
clxxxiii, Art. 4: `Libertas a peccato...vera libertas...vera 
servitus est servitus peccati.' 

	|87.  Che~ = ^per cui.~ -- |Avei~ = ^avevi.~ 

	|88.  Custodi~ (imperative), `preserve.' 

	|94.  Assommi~, `achieve.' 

	|96.~  The `prayer and holy love' are Beatrice's. 

	|97.~  St. Bernard, ^In Ascensione Domini Sermo~, iv, 9 (cf.
G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l' ordine del~ `^Paradiso' dantesco~,
I, 1911, 245), exhorts his monks to contemplate the seats and
mansions on high. 

	|103.  Croazia~, `Croatia.' -- Cf. Petrarch's sonnet `Movesi
il vecchierel canuto e bianco.' 

	|104.~  The Veronica is the true image of the Saviour, 
left on a kerchief which a holy woman had handed him, on his way
to Calvary, to wipe the sweat from his face.  It was shown at St.
Peter's in Rome on certain days.  Hosts of pilgrims went from 
afar to see it, as Dante tells us in ^V. N.~, XLI, 1-11. 

	|105.  `Who, having craved it for so long, cannot look
enough.' -- Some would read ^fama~ for |fame~: see ^Bull.~,
XVIII, 20. 

	|106.  Fin che~ etc., `as long as it is exhibited.' 

	|111.~  St. Bernard in his meditations had a foretaste of
the peace of Heaven.  In the ^Meditationes Piissimae~ (ascribed
to him), i, we find a rhapsody on the joys of contemplation.  Cf.
^Sermones in Cantica Canticorum~, XXIII, 15-16, and lxxiv. 

	|112.  Esser~, `existence.' 

	|116.  Veggi~ = ^vegga~ or ^veda.~ 

	|120.  Soverchia~, `surpass' in brightness. 

	|122.  Parte ne lo stremo~, `a part of the highest edge.' 

	|123.  L' altra fronte~, `the rest of the rim.' 

	|124.~  `And as, on earth, the point (of the horizon) where
the chariot-pole (of the sun) is expected.' 

	|125.~  For Phaethon and his luckless attempt to drive the
chariot of the sun, cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 106-108; ^Purg.~ XXIX,
118-120; ^Par.~ XVII, 3. 

	|127.~  The streak of light on Mary's side of the uppermost
tier of the arena is called an `oriflamme of peace.'  The real
oriflamme, -- a red pennant on a gilded staff, given by the
Archangel Gabriel to the kings of France, -- was a standard of 
war. 

	|132.~  Every angel, as has been said before, forms a
species by itself with its own degree of brightness, and its own
ministry. 

	|136.  Divizia~, `wealth.' 

	|140.  Nel caldo suo calor~, `on his own hot heat': i.e., on
Mary, the object of his own burning affection.
