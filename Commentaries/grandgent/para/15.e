	|1.  Liqua~ (Latin ^liquet~), `is manifest.' 

	|3.  Iniqua~: sc., ^volontade.~ 

	|4.  Lira~: the spirits in the Cross. 

	|10.  Bene @e~, `it is right.' 

	|13.  Seren~, `clear skies.' 

	|14.  Subito foco~: a meteor.  Meteors were explained as 
dry vapors which had risen so high as to take fire, and then had
plunged back in the direction of the earth. 

	|15.  Movendo~, `startling.' -- |Sicuri~, `calm.' 

	|22.~  `The gem did not leave its ribbon': the bright spirit
did not go outside the Cross.  Silk ribbons studded with pearls
were common in Dante's time. 

	|23.  Lista radial~, `radiant strip.' 

	|24.  Che parve~, `resembling.' -- |Alabastro~:  a 
translucent screen. 

	|26.~  Cf. the `tu dici' of ^Inf.~ II, 13.  Cf. also
^Conv.~, IV, xxvi, 60: `Virgilio, lo maggior nostro Poeta.' 

	|28-30.~  `O blood of mine, O lavish grace of God!  To 
whom was Heaven's gate ever twice opened, as to thee?'  Heaven 
receives Dante now, and will receive him again after his death; 
such a thing has never happened since the days of St. Paul. -- 
The use of Latin -- the language of Church and school -- adds 
dignity to this celestial greeting.  It is made more appropriate
by the reminiscence of Anchises, to whom, indeed, the phrase 
`sanguis meus' (meaning `my child') belongs: `Proice tela manu, 
sanguis meus,' in ^Aen.~, VI, 835, where Anchises is addressing 
Julius Caesar. 

	|34-36.~  Until now, Dante has not looked into the eyes of
Beatrice in this sphere. 

	|37.~  `Then, joyous to hear and see.' 

	|42.  Si soprapuose~, `shot above.' 

	|49.~  The `welcome and long-felt hunger' is the object 
of `thou hast relieved' in. l. 52. 

	|50.  Tratto~, `derived' from reading of Dante's visit in 
the Book of Fate, `where white and black are never altered.'

	|51.  Du'~ = ^dove.~ 

	|55.  Mei~, `flows.' 

	|56.  Raia~, `radiates.'  Unity is the beginning of number,
as God is the beginning of thought; from the conception of unity
is derived the conception of all numbers, and in the divine mind
all thought is contained.  For a more elaborate interpretation
see ^Giorn. dant.~, XXIII, 226.  For the relation of the numbers
to 1, see H. F. Dunbar, ^Symbolism in Mediaeval Thought and its
Culmination in Dante~, 1929, 336. 

	|58.~  `Who I am.' 

	|60.  Che~, `than,' connecting with ^pi@u gaudioso~ in l. 
59. 

	|63.  Pandi~, `revealest.' 

	|71.~  Other texts have ^arrose~ from ^arrogere.~ 

	|73-75.~  `As soon as the primal Equality (God, in whom 
all powers are perfect and therefore equal) revealed himself to 
you, desire and faculty in each one of you became equal in
weight': the blest have no wish which they have not intelligence
to fulfil.  So Dionysius in ^De Divinis Nominibus~, X, x:
Gardner, 102. 

	|77.  Caldo~: desire. -- |Luce~: intelligence. -- |S@i 
iguali~, `so perfectly balanced.'  |Iguali~ is singular; the form
belongs to eastern and southern Tuscany. 

	|78.  Simiglianze~, `comparisons.' 

	|79.  Argomento~, `means': wit to execute the |voglia.~ 

	|86.  Gioia~, `jewel': the Cross. 

	|88.~  Cf. Mat. iii, 17: `This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased.' For |compiacemmi~, cf. ^femmi~ in ^Purg.~ XXXI,
89. 

	|92.  Cognazione~, `family name': Alighieri.  Alighiero (or
Allagherius), son of Cacciaguida, was the first male member of
the family to bear this name, which, as we learn presently, he 
derived from his mother.  His name occurs in documents of 1189 
(where it is joined with that of his brother Preitenitto) and 
1201.  The |cent' anni e pi@ue~ would seem, therefore, to 
indicate ignorance of the exact date of his death. 

	|93.  Prima cornice~: the circle of Pride, in Purgatory. 
Dante apparently regarded pride as a family failing. 

	|96.  Opere~: prayers. 

	|97.  Cerchia antica~: the old city walls: the ^first~ 
medieval walls, which were virtually identical with the Roman
walls.  See R. Altrocchi, ^Michelino's Dante~, in ^Speculum~, VI,
28-29. 

	|98.~  Beside these walls stood the ancient Abbey, the
^Badia~, whose bell continued, in Dante's day, to mark the hours
for the Florentines.  `Tierce' is the period from 6 to 9 A.M.; 
`nones,' that from noon to 3 P.M. 

	|100.  Catenella~, `bracelet.' 

	|101.  Contigiate~, `fine shod.' 

	|102.  La persona~: the wearer. 

	|104-105.~  The marriageable age had not yet become absurdly
low, nor the dowry ruinously high. 

	|106.~  There were no houses built on too large a scale for
their occupants. 

	|107-108.~  Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, was notorious in
antiquity for his luxury and effeminacy.  He is mentioned by
Paulus Orosius and Egidio Colonna.  Cf. Juvenal, ^Satires~, X, 
362: 

     `Et Venere et coenis et pluma Sardanapali.' 

	|109-111.~  Rome was not yet surpassed in splendor by 
Florence, which has been swifter in its rise and will be swifter
in its fall.  Montemalo (or Montemallo), now Montemario, is a 
hill that affords the approaching traveler a view of Rome; 
similarly the height called Uccellatoio offers the stranger, as
he draws near on the north, an outlook on Florence.  In 
|Uccellatoio~ the -^toio~ counts as one syllable: cf. ^Purg.~ 
XIII, 22: XIV, 66; XX, 52. -- |Che~ in l. 110 refers to
^Montemalo.~ -- |Calo~, `decline.' -- The usual medieval name of
Montemario was ^Mons Malus~: ^Giorn. stor.~, LVII, 363. 

	|112.~  Bellincion Berti, father of the `good Gualdrada' of
^Inf.~ XVI, 37, was a worthy and distinguished Florentine citizen
of the second half of the 12th century.  Cf. G. Villani,
^Croniche~, IV, i. 

	|115.~  Of the Nerli and del Vecchio families it seems that
virtually nothing is known. 

	|116.  Pelle scoperta~, `bare leather'; according to some,
`bare skin.' 

	|117.~  Cf. Pr. xxxi, 19: `She layeth her hands to the
spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.' 

	|128.~  Cianghella, of the della Tosa family, a contemporary
of Dante, seems to have been notorious for her immodesty. 
Boccaccio speaks of her in the ^Corbaccio~, 228-230. -- Lapo
Salterello, also of Dante's time and one of his fellow-exiles, a
jurist and versifier, was in general a man of good renown; but
Dino Compagni, in his ^Cronica~, II, xxii, enumerates him among
the `malvagi cittadini,' and accuses him of corrupt practices. 

	|129.~  For Cincinnatus, the ploughman dictator, cf. VI, 46;
for Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, ^Inf.~ IV, 128. 

	|133.  Chiamata~: invoked in the pains of childbirth. 

	|134.  Batisteo~ = ^Battistero.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 17. 

	|139.~  Conrad III, of Swabia, leader of the crusade of
1147.  As Conrad III never came to Italy, possibly Dante has 
confounded him with Conrad II.  See Villani, ^Cron.~, IV, 9; cf.
^Bull.~, IV, 54, and XI, 9, note 2. 

	|140.  Milizia~, `knighthood.' 

	|143.  Legge~, `faith': Mohammedanism. 

	|144.  Pastor~: the Popes, who are no longer interested 
in the reconquest of the Holy Land. 

	|145.  Turpa~ = ^turpe~, `base.' 

	|146.  Disviluppato~, `released.' 

	|147.  Deturpa~, `debases.'
