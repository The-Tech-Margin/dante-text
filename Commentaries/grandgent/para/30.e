	|1-3.~  Dante is about to describe the aspect of the sky,
with the stars gradually fading, a little before dawn. `The sixth
hour (i.e., noon) is glowing' some `6000 miles away from us.' 
Noon is separated from sunrise by a quarter of the earth's
circumference -- that is, according to our author's geography
(^Conv.~, III, v, 103), by 5,100, a quarter of 20,400.  If noon,
then, is 6000 miles off, sunrise must still be 900 miles (or
about an hour) away.  The sun is below our horizon on one side,
and the earth's conical shadow, projected into space, is
correspondingly above our horizon on the other.  As the sun
rises, the shadow sinks; and when the middle of the sun shall be
on the horizon line, the apex of the shadow will be on the same
plane in the opposite quarter.  An hour before dawn, therefore,
`this earth is already bowing its shadow down almost to the level
bed' of the horizon.  Cf. Moore, III, 58-59. 

	|4.  A noi profondo~, `deep above us.' 

	|6.  Parere~, `visibility.' -- |Questo fondo~, `this
bottom': the earth's surface. 

	|7.  Ancella~: Aurora, the dawn. 

	|9.  Di vista in vista~, `from sight to sight': i.e., star
by star.  Cf. II, 115. 

	|10.  Sude~ (Lat. ^ludit~), `sports.' 

	|11.  Vinse~: see XXVIII, 16-18. 

	|12.~  In the allegorical vision which Dante has beheld, the
Point seems to be encompassed by the rings of light, whereas in
reality God encompasses everything. 

	|14.  Per che~, `wherefore.' -- |Tornar~ depends on
^costrinse~ in l. 15. 

	|15.  Nulla vedere~ (`seeing nothing') and |amor~ are
subjects of |costrinse.~ 

	|18.  Vice~, `turn,' moment. 

	|19.  Si trasmoda~, `transcends measure.' 

	|23.  Punto~, `incident.' 

	|24.~  A `comic poet' is one who writes in familiar, a
`tragic poet' one who writes in exalted style.  Cf. Epistola X,
x, 209-212.  The Dante of the Canzoni is a `tragedo,' the author
of the ^Commedia~ a `comico.' 

	|25.  Viso~, `eye.' -- Cf. ^Conv.~, III, Canzone II, 60:
`Come raggio di sole un fragil viso.' 

	|27.  Scema~, `deprives.' 

	|30.  Preciso~, `cut off,' prevented. 

	|33.~  `As every artist (must stop) at his utmost.' -- Now
that Beatrice has reached her own home, the Empyrean, she is seen
in her full beauty, which defies description. 

	|34.  Bando~, `heralding.'  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXX, 13; ^Par.~
XXVI, 45. 

	|37.  Spedito~, `ready.' 

	|39.~  `The biggest body' is the Primum Mobile, which
surrounds all the rest of the material world. 

	|43.~  In the Empyrean are two victorious armies, the 
`soldiery' of blessed souls that resisted temptation, and the 
host of good angels that triumphed over the bad. 

	|44-45.~  The spirits of the elect will be seen by Dante `in
that aspect' in which they are to appear at the Last Judgment:
i.e., in their bodily form. 

	|46.  Discetti~, `scatters.' 

	|47-48.  Li spiriti visivi~, `the spirits (or sense) of 
sight.' -- |S@i che~ etc., `so that it (the flash) deprives the
eye of the effect of even more impressive objects.' 

	|49.~  Cf. Acts xxii, 6: suddenly there shone from heaven a
great light round about me' -- `^circumfulsit~ me lux copiosa.' 

	|51.~  Cf. Acts xxii, 11: `I could not see for the glory of
that light.' 

	|60.  Non si fosser difesi~, `had not withstood it.' 

	|61.~  See Daniel vii, 10: `A fiery stream issued and came
forth before him.'  Also Rev. xxii, 1: `And he shewed me a pure
river of water of life clear as crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb.'  Cf. Isaiah lxvi, 12.  In the
apocryphal Book of Enoch, rivers of flaming fire issue from under
the throne.  St. Bernard, ^Sermones de Diversis~, XLII, vii,
says: `torrente voluptatis potantur justi.'  Dante makes of this 
traditional river a symbol of Grace. 

	|63.~  The spring flowers that cover the banks are the souls
of the just. 

	|64-66.~  The `living sparks' that emerge from the flood and
nestle in the flowers, `like rubies set in gold,' are the angels
whose function it is to assist in the transmission of grace. 
Angels are compared to bees by St. Anselm (see G. Busnelli, ^Il
concetto e l' ordine del `Paradiso' dantesco~, I, 1911, 232). 
Some texts have ^fulvido~ for |fluido~: `glowing with glory'
instead of `gushing with glory.' 

	|68.  Gurge~, `torrent.' 

	|71.  Vei~ = ^vedi.~ 

	|72.  Turge~, `swells: cf. X, 144. 

	|73.  Bei~ = ^beva.~ 

	|79.  Acerbe~, `unripe.' 

	|81.  Viste~, `eyes.' -- |Superbe~, `exalted.' 

	|82.  Rua~, `plunges': cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 33. 

	|87.~  `Which pours forth for our betterment.' 

	|88-89.~  `The eaves of my eyelids' are the lashes. 

	|95.  Vidi~: note the insistence on the reality of the
vision of Heaven, implied in the repetition of |vidi~ in rime
with itself in ll. 95, 97, 99. 

	|96.~  Cf. ll. 43-44. 

	|100.  Che~ is the subject of |face (= fa~).  We find that
the light still represents Grace. 

	|102.~  Cf. St. Augustine, ^Confessions~, I, i: `Fecisti nos
ad te, et inquietum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat in te.' 

	|106-108.~  The whole material universe forms a globe whose
exterior is that of the Primum Mobile.  One ray of God's grace
descends upon this sphere, and gives it life and motion; then,
reflected from its smooth round surface, is transformed into the
circular ocean of light that appears as the floor of Paradise. --
|Fassi~ = ^si fa.~ 

	|109.  Clivo~, `hiliside.' -- |Di suo imo~, `at its foot.' 

	|111.  Nel verde~: other texts have ^nell' erbe.~ --
|Opimo~, `rich': cf. XVIII, 33. 

	|112.  Soprastando~, `overlooking.' 

	|113.  Specchiarsi~: cf. the figure of Rachel, the type of
contemplation, in ^Purg.~ XXVII, 104-105. -- |Soglie~, `tiers.' 

	|114.~  `All of us who have returned on high.' 

	|115-116.~  Cf. ll. 103-105. 

	|117.~  The vast, cup-like theatre is called a `rose,' and
its sections `petals.' 

	|119.  Prendeva~, `took in.' 

	|120.  Il quanto e 'l Quale~: cf. XXIII, 92. 

	|121.~  `There, nearness and distance neither add nor
subtract.' 

	|123.  Nulla rileva~, `is of no importance.' 

	|124.  Nel giallo~, `into the yellow,' is to be connected 
with ^mi trasse Beatrice~ in l. 128.  The `yellow of the rose' is
the sea of light that forms the bottom of the arena.  Cf. Rev.
iv, 6: `And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
crystal.' 

	|125.~  `Which expands, and rises in steps, and breathes 
sweet.' -- |Che~ refers to ^rosa.~ -- |Redole~: Latin ^redolet.~ 

	|126.  Sempre verna~, `makes perpetual spring.'  Cf.
Epistola V, v, 81 (also 89-90). 

	|129.~  See Rev. iii, 5: `He that overcometh, the same shall
be clothed in white raiment'; and vii, 13: `What are these which
are arrayed in white robes?'  Cf. ^Par.~ XXV, 88-96. 

	|131-132.~  Men are so wicked, and the end of the world is
so near, that only a few more souls are expected in Paradise. 
Cf. ^Conv.~, II, xv, 115-116: `noi siamo gi@a nell' ultima etade
del secolo.' 

	|133.~  The impressive episode of a vacant chair in Heaven
is found in several mediaeval legends: in the Syriac version of
the ^Visio S. Pauli~, in the vision of Tundal, and in the
^Dialogus Miraculorum~ of Caesarius of Heisterbach. 

	|134.~  The homage which Dante, in these lines, pays to his
worshipped Henry acquires tremendous force from the unfitness of
a symbol of mundane sovereignty in Paradise.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XIX, 
133-138. 

	|135.~  See XIV, 1-2.  Cf. Rev. xix, 9. 

	|136.  Agosta~, `Imperial.' 

	|137.~  Henry of Luxembourg, elected Emperor (Henry VII) in
1308, crowned at Milan in 1311, attempted to restore the balance
of power and the Imperial authority in Italy, but met with
determined opposition, and died at Buonconvento in 1313. 

	|139.  Vi ammalia~, `bewitches you mortals.' -- possibly 
`dazes': ^Stud. dant.~, I, 104. 

	|140.  Fantolino~, `babe.' 

	|142.~  The Pope, or `prefect in the sacred court,' is 
Clement V, who died in 1314, eight months after Henry. 

	|143.  Palese e coverto~, `openly and secretly.' 

	|144.~  `Shall refuse to travel on the same road with him.' 
Clement after encouraging Henry to undertake the Italian
expedition, underhandedly worked against him, and finally opposed
him without disguise.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIX 82-87; ^Par.~ XXVII, 82. 

	|146-147.  Detruso~, `thrust down.' -- For Simon Magus, cf.
^Inf.~ XIX, I. -- Clement shall fall into the 3d pouch of the 8th
circle of Hell, where simonists are planted upside down in fiery
holes.  In the hole of the simoniacal Popes, each new arrival
pushes his predecessors further down: ^Inf.~ XIX, 73-75. 

	|147.~  Clement's predecessor in simony is Boniface VIII: 
^Inf.~ XIX, 51-57.  He is called `the man of Anagni' because he
was born in that town, and in 1303 was assaulted and taken 
prisoner there: ^Purg.~ XX, 85-90.  Anagni was known also as 
^Alagna~ and ^Anagna.~ -- These fearful words are the last spoken
by Beatrice.
