	|58-60.~  `If he means that the credit or the blame for 
influence (on human souls) reverts to these (heavenly) 
revolutions, perhaps the bow (of his speech) hits some truth.' 
Dante is evidently reluctant to impute fundamental error to
such a philosopher as Plato.  See ^Conv.~, IV, xxi, 12-19,

souls in question cannot invoke violence as a sufficient
excuse. -- |Pate~ = ^patisce~, `suffers.' -- |Conferisce~,

49-51), who had betrayed her husband's hiding-place: ^Met.~ IX,
407-408.  Thus, `not to be lacking in duty, he became
undutiful.' Cf. `impietate pia' in ^Met.~, VIII, 477. 

	|106.~  `I will have thee believe that at this point.' 

	|109-111.~  Cf. Aristotle, ^Ethics~, III, i; St. Thomas,
