	|2.  L' uno e l' altro~ is the subject, and |che~ is the 
object, of |spira.~  According to Orthodox Catholic faith, the 
Holy Ghost (or Divine Love) emanates from both Father and Son, 
and consists in their eternal love for each other.  Cf. ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xxxvi and xxxvii. 

	|4.~  This phrase is the object of ^f@e~ in l. 5. 

	|6.  Chi ci@o rimira~ is the subject of ^puote~ in l. 5. 

	|9.~  The `two motions' are the diurnal and the annual 
revolutions of the sun, represented by the celestial equator and
the celestial ecliptic.  They `strike,' or cross, each other at 
Aries, in which constellation the sun is at the time of Dante's 
journey. 

	|10.  Comincia~ is imperative. -- |Vagheggiar~, `gaze 
rapturously.' 

	|11.  L'~, like the ^lei~ in the next line, stands for 
the ^arte~ of l. 10. 

	|13.  Si dirama~, `branches.'  At Aries the ecliptic slants
across the equator. 

	|14.  Pianeti~: the seven planets move through the signs 
of the zodiac, and thus their influence is properly distributed 
and modified. 

	|15.  Chiama~, `invokes,' i.e., needs. 

	|16.~  If the ecliptic, or zodiac, were not thus slanting,
the solar and stellar influence could not operate as it does: cf.
^Conv.~, III, v, 126-142, 196-209.  There would be no seasons,
and hence no generation.  

	|19.~  If the obliquity of the ecliptic were greater or
less, the succession of the seasons would not be so effective on
the part of the globe where there is land.  Cf. Ristoro d'
Arrezzo, ^Della composizione del mondo.~ II, iii. 

	|21.  Gi@u e su~: on either side of the equator.  Cf.
^Purg.~ IV, 63. 

	|22.  Riman~ is imperative. 

	|23.  Si preliba~, `is touched upon,' suggested. 

	|28.  Lo ministro maggior~: the sun. 

	|31.  Quella parte~: Aries. -- |Su~: ll. 8-9. -- |Si 
rammenta~, `is mentioned.' 

	|32-33.~  The sun's apparent course around the earth, from
day to day, is spiral.  In the spring season it rises every day
further north and earlier than the day before.  Cf. Ristoro
d'Arezzo, I, xxiii. 

	|35-36.  Se non~, etc., `any more than one perceives the 
coming of a thought before it begins.'  |Del suo venire~ depends
on |s' accorge.~  |Suo~, `its,' the thought's.  A disconnected 
thought, without associations, may be contrasted with the thought
of ^Inf.~ XXIII, 10 (`E come l'un pensier de l'altro scoppia'): 
A. Fazzi in ^Giorn. Stor.~, LXXIII, 112. 

	|37.  Scorge~, `conducts.' 

	|39.  Si sporge~, `extends.'  Revelation enlightens us 
instantaneously. 

	|41-42.  Era...parvente~, `was manifest.'  The souls of the
great theologians are brighter than the sun.  Daniel xii, 3: `And
they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever
and ever.'  Mat. xiii, 43: `Then shall the righteous shine forth
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.' 

	|43.  Perch@e~, `though.' 

	|45.  Di veder si brami~, `let men long to see it!'  Let 
them make themselves fit for Heaven. 

	|48.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. lxxxv,
Art. 2: `Oculus non gloriosus non potest inspicere solem, propter
magnitudinem claritatis:' 

	|49.~  The `fourth family' is the fourth order of the blest,
the theologians. 

	|50.~  Cf. Ps. xvii (Vulg. xvi), 15: `I shall be satisfied
(^satiabor~), when I awake, with thy likeness.' 

	|51.~  God `satisfies' the blest by revealing to them the 
mystery of the Trinity: they see how the Holy Ghost and the Son 
exist in him.  Cf. Dante's profession of faith: ^Par.~ XXIV, 130. 

	|54.  Sensibil~, `visible': sc., sun. 

	|55.  Digesto~, `disposed.' 

	|57.  Gradir~, `assent.' 

	|60.  Ecliss@o~, `it eclipsed.'  For the moment, Revelation
disappears in the direct contemplation of God. 

	|63.~  `Divided among many things my mind, which was 
concentrated on one.'  The blessed souls are revealed again. 

	|67.~  Latona's daughter is Diana, the moon.  Sometimes, in
moist weather, we see the moon `girdled' with a shining halo. 
Cf. ^Purg.~ XXIX, 78. 

	|69.~  Moisture is `the thread of which the belt is made.' 

	|71.  Gioie~, `jewels' -- Tor. cites from Marco Polo a
couple of passages describing eastern countries whose rulers will
not allow the rubies and pearls, which abound there, to be `taken
out of the kingdom.' 

	|74.  Non s' impenna~, `does not grow wings.'  Cf. Isaiah 
xl, 31: `But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their 
strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles.' 

	|75.~  To expect, on earth, to conceive of that song is as
hopeless as expecting news from the dumb. 

	|76.  Poi~ = ^poi che~, `when.' 

	|79.~  For the movements of the ^ballate~, which were danced
and sung by ladies holding one another by the hand, see ^Bull.~,
IV, 180. 

	|82.  Quando~, `since.' 

	|83.~  Since the original sin, man has needed grace to
kindle his natural love of God: ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima
Secundae, Qu. cix, Art. 3. 

	|87.  U'~ = ^ove.~ -- Here is a distinct promise of Dante's
ultimate salvation.  Cf. ^Purg.~ II, 91-92. 

	|90.  Se non come~, `any more than.'  It would be as
unnatural for one of these souls to refuse to satisfy Dante, who
is so evidently one of the elect, as it would be for water not to
run down hill. 

	|92.~  The `garland' is the ring of shining spirits: l. 
65. -- |Vagheggia~, `gazes rapturously upon.' 

	|93.  Avvalora~, `strengthens.' 

	|96.~  The speaker, St. Thomas Aquinas, who belonged to the
Dominican order, declares that St. Dominic led his flock over a
road where the sheep `fatten well, if they do not stray,' i.e., 
they have abundance of spiritual food, as long as they adhere to
his rule.  This expression calls for an explanation in the next 
canto.  Cf. Pr. xi, 25: `The liberal soul shall be made fat 
(^impinguabitur).'~ 

	|97 ff.~  For the companions of St. Thomas, see Gardner, 
257-258, 261: first comes his master; the next nine are all cited
in his ^Summa Theologiae~, and on three of them (Peter Lombard,
Dionysius, and Boethius) he wrote special commentaries; on his 
left is Sigier of Brabant, his opponent, whom he confuted. 

	|99.~  The Swabian known as Albertus Magnus, Albert of 
Cologne, and `Doctor Universalis,' who lived from 1193 to 1280, 
and taught for some time at Cologne, was the most erudite man of
the Middle Ages and one of the greatest scholars of all time. 
His most important work was the reconciliation of Aristotelian 
philosophy and Christian theology.  St. Thomas was his principal
follower. 

	|102.  Serto~, `wreath': cf. l. 92. 

	|104.~  Gratian, in the first half of the 12th century, 
composed the ^Decretum~, a collection of sacred and
ecclesiastical utterances, which became the leading text-book of
Canon Law.  This work did much to establish an agreement between
religious and civil law, and thus `helped the one and the other 
court.'  He marked the jurisdictions of Church and State, and may
therefore be called a representation of `Prudentia legislativa.' 

	|107.~  Peter Lombard, the `Magister Sententiarum,'
professor in Bologna and Paris, and Bishop of Paris, made four 
volumes of doctrinal excerpts from the Church Fathers, called the
^Sententiae~, which were used in the schools as a manual of 
theology.  In his preface he compares his work to the widow's 
mite (Luke xxi, 2).  He lived in the 12th century.  He was called
^Jedidiah~, or `Beloved.' 

	|109-110.~  The `fifth light,' that of Solomon, is the `most
beautiful' of all the circle, since it comes from the love which
phrased the Song of Songs, the epithalamium of Christ and Church. 
He revealed truth in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. 

	|111.  Gola~, `is greedy.' -- |Novella~, `news,' concerning
its fate.  Some theologians (as St. Jerome) maintained that
Solomon was saved, others (as St. Augustine) that he was damned. 
See 1 Kings, xi, 4-12. 

	|112-114.~  See 1 Kings iii, 12: `Lo, I have given thee a 
wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee
before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.'
It is apparent that the phrase `no second ever rose,' in l. 114,
has raised in Dante's mind a question which is answered in Canto
XIII. 

	|115.~  The `candle' is Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Paul's
convert in Athens (Acts xvii, 34), to whom was ascribed a
Neo-Platonic work of the 5th or 6th century, called ^De Caelesti
Hierarchia~, the great authority on the orders of the angels,
their nature, their functions, and their relation to the heavens. 
Cf. XXVIII, 130-139; also Letter to Can Grande, xxi, 404-406. 

	|118-120.~  At the beginning of the 5th century Paulus 
Orosius, a Lusitanian priest, composed the first compendium of 
universal history, entitled ^Historia adversus Paganos~, showing
the hand of God in the direction of human affairs, and refuting
the pagan attribution of present troubles to the baleful
influence of Christianity.  This work, which was widely read, was
one of Dante's chief sources of information.  It was undertaken 
at the suggestion of St. Augustine, whose ^De Civitate Dei~ it 
supplements. -- For a different identification, see G. Busnath in
^Civilt@a Catholica~, 1914, fasc. 1. 

	|121.  Trani~, `drawest.' 

	|124.  Per vedere~, `through seeing.' 

	|125.~  `The blessed soul that exposes the deceptive world'
is Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, author of ^Consolatio
Philosophiae~, a beautiful treatise in prose interspersed with
poetry, much admired in the Middle Ages.  It was one of the two
books with which Dante began the serious study of philosophy:
^Conv.~, II, xiii, 14-16; xvi, 4-8.  He may well stand for
`Prudentia monastica.' 

	|127-129.~  Boethius, who was an important statesman as 
well as an author, was imprisoned, under false charges, and 
finally put to death by Theodoric in 525.  He is known in the
Church as St. Severinus, being regarded as a martyr to
Christianity: cf. G. Villani, ^Croniche~, II, v.  After the
`exile' from Rome, his body was buried in the church of S. Pietro
in Cielo d' Oro (St. Peter's of the Golden Ceiling) in Pavia. 

	|131.~  St. Isidore, Bishop of Seville, who died in 636,
wrote a very useful encyclopaedia, called ^Origines~ or 
^Etymologiae.~ -- The Venerable Bede, an English Monk who died in
735, was the author of an important historical work, the
^Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum.~ -- Richard, prior of 
the Monastery of St. Victor in Paris, composed, among other 
things, a treatise ^De Contemplatione~: cf. Letter to Can Grande,
xxviii, 554.  He died in 1173.  According to St. Bonaventure,
Dionysius and Richard especially taught the anagogical sense of
the Scriptures. 

	|132.  A considerar~, `in contemplation.' -- |Viro~, `man.'
-- Richard of St. Victor was called the `Great Contemplator.' 

	|134-135.  In pensieri gravi~, `immersed in deep problems.'
-- |A morir~, etc., `thought that he was moving too slowly toward
death.' -- He was eager to reach Heaven, where his questions
might be answered. 

	|136.~  Sigier of Brabant, a brilliant and daring,
philosopher, was a professor at the University of Paris in the 
third quarter of the 13th century.  After two condemnations for 
heresy, he went to Orvieto, and was there (it would seem) 
murdered by a half-crazy cleric.  We may infer that Dante knew 
nothing of his heresy nor of his tragic end, or perhaps Dante 
assumed that he repented.  His unorthodox theory of intelligence
was refuted by St. Thomas, who now presents him.  See P. 
Mandonnet, ^Siger de Brabant et l' Averro,isme latin au XIII+e~ 
si@ecle~, 1899; F. Tocco, ^Le correnti del pensiero filosofico 
nel secolo~ XIII, 1901; Toynbee, 314; ^Rom.~, XXIX, 107; U. Cosmo
in ^Giorn. Stor.~, LXVII, 401 ff.; B. Nardi in ^Giorn. dant.~, 
XXII, 182, and in ^Nuovo Giornale dantesco~, I, 123. 

	|137.~  Sigier lectured in the Latin Quarter, in the ^rue 
du Fouarre~ (Straw St.), which in Latin is ^Vicus Straminis~ or 
^Straminum.~  It is now called ^rue Dante.~ 

	|138.~  `Demonstrated enviable truths.'  For the use of 
|invidiosi~, cf. Epistola V, ii, 24.  Another interpretation of 
|invidiosi~ is possible: it may refer to Sigier's work on logic,
the ^Impossibilia~, an exposure of sophistry by the example of 
six false syllogisms -- truths ^hostile~ to one another. 

	|139 ff.~  According to Fletcher, we have a wheel of 12 
counseling prophets, moved by the Holy Spirit through its Gifts,
sounding a concordant note; the right timing of actions is an 
important function of the Gift of Counsel. 

	|140.  La sposa di Dio~: the Church. 

	|141.  Mattinar lo sposo~, `sing matins to her Bridegroom,'
Christ. 

	|142.  Che~ = ^in cui.~ 

	|144.  Turge~, `swells.' 

	|146.  Tempra~, `modulation.' 

	|147.  P@o~ = ^Pu@o.~ 

	|148.  Insempra~: a word coined by Dante from ^sempre.~
