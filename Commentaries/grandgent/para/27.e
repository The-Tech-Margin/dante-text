	|1-6.~  The splendor of the host, as it sings the hymn ^Gloria
Patri~, seems to the enraptured spectator `a smile of the
universe'! 

	|10.~  The `four torches' are the lights of Peter, James,
John, and Adam. 

	|11.  Quella~: the flame of St. Peter. 

	|13-15.~  If the planets Jupiter and Mars were birds, and 
each should moult and exchange feathers with the other, Jupiter
would turn red and Mars white: thus St. Peter's effulgence 
reddens.  A whimsical figure. 

	|16.  Comparte~, `distributes.' 

	|17.  Vice~, `turn.' 

	|22.~  In 1300 Boniface VIII was Pope; but his election 
corruptly procured during the lifetime of his predecessor
(Celestine V), is condemned as invalid by St. Peter, first of the
Popes.  The discordant wrath of Peter and the whole heavenly host
is rendered the more terrific by its incongruity with the peaceful
joy of Paradise. 

	|23.~  For the repetition, cf. Jeremiah, vii, 4, where `the
temple of the Lord' occurs three times. -- |Vaca~, `is vacant.' 

	|24.  Presenza~, `sight.' 

	|25.~  St. Peter's `burial place' is Rome, where he suffered
martyrdom. 

	|28.  Che~ is the subject of ^dipigne~ in l. 29. -- |Per lo
sole avverso~, `the sun being opposite.' -- Cf. ^Met.~, III,
183-185: 

     `Qui color infectis adversi solis ab ictu 
     Nubibus esse solet aut purpureae aurorae, 
     Is fuit in vultu visae sine veste Dianae.' 

	|33.  Fane~ = ^fa~: cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 31, XVIII, 87; ^Purg.~ 
IV, 22, XXV, 47. 

	|34.~  Cf. Daniel iii, 19: `Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
fury, and the form of his visage was changed.' 

	|36.  Mat.~  xxvii, 45: `Now from the sixth hour there was
darkness all over the land unto the ninth hour.' 

	|39.  Pi@ue~: `more' than the voice. 

	|40.  Allevata~, `nurtured.' 

	|41.~  Linus and Cletus were Bishops of Rome in the 1st 
century. 

	|42.~  Cf. 1 Peter v, 1-2. 

	|44.~  Sixtus, Pius, Calixtus, and Urban, Bishops of Rome in
the 2d and 3d centuries, were all martyrs. 

	|45.  Fleto~ (Latin ^fletus~), `weeping.' 

	|46-48.~  We never intended that our successors should treat
the Guelfs as sheep, the Ghibellines as goats: cf. Mat. xxv, 33. 

	|50.~  `Should become an emblem on a standard.'  The Papal
troops sent against Frederick II in 1229 wore this token on their
shoulders, and were called ^chiavisegnati.~  In Dante's own time
the Pope was again warring against Christians: see ^Inf.~ XXVII,
85-90.  For a Papal banner with the figure of St. Peter, cf.
^Rom.~, II, 28, ll. 817-818. 

	|52.~  The Papal seal bears the image of St. Peter. 

	|55.~  Mat. vii, 15: `Beware of false prophets which come to
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.' 
Cf. the Proven$cal poem by Peire Cardinal, ^Li clerc si fan
pastor.~ 

	|58.~  Cahors, the old capital of Quercy in southwestern 
France, was a nest of usury: see ^Inf.~ XI, 50.  John XXII, Pope
from 1316 to 1334, came from that town: cf. XVIII, 130-136.  His
predecessor Clement V, was a Gascon; he is mentioned in ^Inf.~ 
XIX, 82-87, ^Purg.~ XXXII, 148-160, ^Par.~ XVII, 82. 

	|61.  Con Scipio~, `together with Scipio': Scipio the 
younger, who conquered Hannibal and thus saved Rome.  Cf. 
^Conv.~, IV, v, 164-171. 

	|62.  A~, `for.' 

	|63.  Concipio~ (Latin) = ^concepisco~, `conceive.' 

	|64.  Per~, `because of.' 

	|67-72.~  These lines present the strange and lovely picture
of an inverted snowstorm.  Dante sees `the aether grow beautiful
flaked with triumphant vapors' (the swarm of bright spirits
returning to the Empyrean), `just as our air flakes downward with
frozen vapors' in midwinter, when the sun is in Capricorn -- `when
the horn of the Sky-Goat and the Sun touch each other.'  It must be
remembered that `wet vapors' produce rain, snow, and hail, while
wind, lightning, and meteors are caused by `dry vapors.' 

	|73.  I suoi sembianti~, `their forms.' 

	|74.  Il mezzo~, `the intervening space.' -- |Lo molto~, `its
muchness,' or extent. 

	|75.~  `Prevented it (my sight) from passing beyond.' 

	|76.  Assolto~, `released.' 

	|77.  Adima~, `lower.' 

	|78.  Se' volto~, `hast revolved.' 

	|79.~  See XXII, 133-153. 

	|80-81.~  The ancients divided the habitable part of the 
earth into seven strips, or `climates,' stretching east and west.
In the middle of the first, or most southerly, of these zones is
the meridian of Jerusalem; the westerly end is at the meridian of
Gibraltar.  The distance between the middle and the end, according
to Dante's geography, is 90+o~, or six hours' revolution.  See
Moore, III, 101 and 132. 

	|82-84.  Gade~, `Cadiz.'  Beyond Cadiz the poet sees the `mad
track' of Ulysses out in the unknown Ocean; cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI,
90-142, where the voyage is described as a ^folle volo~ (l. 125).
On the hither side of Cadiz he sees `nearly' (|presso~) the 
Phoenician shore, where Europa mounted on the back of Jupiter 
disguised as a bull; cf. ^Met.~, II, 833-875, especially 868-869. 

	|86.  Aiuola~: cf. XXII, 151. 

	|87.  Partito~, `distant.' 

	|88.  Donnea~, `dallies': cf. XXIV, 118. 

	|89.  Ridure~ = ^ridurre~, `bring back.'  Such north Italian
forms were occasionally used by Tuscan poets: ^condure, redure,
ridure, r@etrare, trare~, etc. 

	|91-93.~  `And if nature or art ever made bait of human flesh
or paintings of it, to catch the eyes in order to possess the
mind.' 

	|97.  Virt@u~, `power.' -- |Indulse~, `granted': cf. IX, 34. 

	|98.~  `Leda's nest' is the constellation of Gemini so called
because the Twins (Castor and Pollux) were the children of Leda by
Jupiter in the form of a swan. 

	|99.  Ciel velocissimo~: the ninth heaven, or Primum Mobile,
which contains no visible bodies. 

	|100.  Vivissime~, `quickest': other texts have ^vicissime~ or
^vicinissime.~  The real reading would seem to be ^viciissime~ (for
^viciissime~ = ^vicinissime) e eccelse~ or, possibly, ^ed infime.~ 
While in other spheres the lower part is less bright than the upper
and otherwise differentiated, in the Primum Mobile all parts are
alike.  So the 13th century Bartolomeo da Parma: see E. G. Parodi
in ^Bull~ XXVI, 66.  Cf. G. Vandelli in ^Stud. dant.~ X, 116. 

	|106.~  `The order of the universe, which stills (holds 
motionless)...' 

	|107.~  `The middle' is the earth, a motionless globe 
surrounded by the revolving heavens. 

	|109.  Dove~, `where': location. 

	|111.  La virt@u ch' ei piove~, `the power which it (the ninth
heaven) showers' -- transmits to the rest of the world. 

	|112-114.~  `Light and love envelop it round about, as it 
envelops the other heavens; and that belt (the Empyrean, or Heaven
of light and love) is governed only by him (God) who girds it.' 
Every sphere except the ninth is surrounded by another sphere; but
the ninth, the outermost sphere of the material universe, is
surrounded only by the world of spirit, the Heaven of light and
love, the Empyrean, which is the Mind of God.  Moreover, every
material heaven is directed by an order of angelic Intelligences;
but in the Empyrean the only governing Intelligence is the Lord, in
whom it exists. -- For |intende~, cf. ^Conv.~, II, Canzone I, l. 1.

	|115.  Distinto~, `marked.'  The unit of time is the day,
which is determined by the revolution of the Primum Mobile: cf. 
^Conv.~, II, xv, 132-157; ^Summa Theologiae~ Prima, Qu. x, Art. 1
and 4. 

	|116.  Misurati~, `regulated.'  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima
Secundae, Qu. xc, Art. 4. 

	|117.~  Just as 10 is determined by 5 (its `half') and 2 
(its `fifth'). 

	|118.  Testo~, `flower-pot': in this grotesque metaphor the
spheres are pots, in one of which (the ninth) Time has its roots,
while its leaves and flowers appear in the others. 

	|121.  Affonde~, `sinkest.'  Greed is likened to a flood. --
This apostrophe is suggested by the contrast between Time and
Eternity, on the one hand, and, on the other, the pettiness and 
brief duration of the goods coveted by men. 

	|124.~  Cf. Romans vii, 18: `to will is present with me; but
how to perform that which is good I find not.' 

	|126.  Bozzacchioni~, `abortions.'  The word is used to 
designate plums that are spoiled on the tree. 

	|136-138.~  In ^Mon.~, I, ix, 4-10, Dante (referring to 
Aristotle's ^Physics~, II, ii) declares that humanity is the child
of the sky, or the sun, and therefore should imitate Heaven:
`Humanum genus filius est caeli...generat enim homo hominem et
sol...' -- `He who brings morning and leaves evening' (l. 138) is
obviously the sun, and his `fair daughter' would seem to be the
human race.  `In the primal sight' (l. 137) probably signifies `in
the sight of God.'  The obscure lines may, then, be interpreted:
`Thus is blackened, in the sight of God, the white skin of human
nature, the sun's fair child.' -- For another interpretation, see
J. E. Shaw, in ^Modern Philology~, XVIII, 507. 

	|139.  Facci~ = ^faccia.~ 

	|142.  Gennaio~ is to be counted as two syllables: cf. ^Purg.~
XIII, 22, XIV, 66, XX, 52. -- |Si sverni~, `be unwintered,' become
a spring instead of a winter month.  Through an inaccuracy in the
Julian calendar, which made the year of 365 days and 6 hours, the
solar year gained over the standard year about one day in a
century; in the course of something less than 90 centuries, then,
January would have been pushed into the spring, if the error had
not been corrected (as it was in 1582 under Gregory XIII, when the
present calendar was adopted).  The line means: `But before 9000
years have gone by,' i.e., `within a little while.'  Another
reading for ^ruggiran~ is ^raggiran~; but see Jeremiah xxv, 30, 32:
`Dominus de excelso ^rugiet~, et de habitaculo suo dabit vocem
suam...et turbo magnus egredietur a summatibus terrae.'  See E. G.
Gardner in ^Modern Language Review~, XVII, 323. 

	|143.~  The Julian year was really about 1/130 of a day too
long; but the error was sometimes estimated at a figure not far
from 1/100.  See Moore, III, 96-97. 

	|145.  Fortuna~, `storm.' 

	|147.  Classe~ (Latin ^classis~), `fleet.' -- Once more we
have a vague prophecy of violent reformation. 

	|148.~  The poet returns to the metaphor of l. 126.
