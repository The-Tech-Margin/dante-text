	|1.  Affetto~, `intent.' -- |Piacer~, `delight': Mary. -- 
|Contemplante~: Bernard. 

	|4-6.~  The `wound' of original sin (inflicted by Eve and 
healed by Mary) is discussed in ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima
Secundae, Qu. lxxxv, Art. 3.  Mary is often represented as the 
counterpart of Eve.  The word ^AVE~, with which she is greeted, 
is the reverse of ^EVA~; so says, among others, Dante's son 
Pietro.  St. Bernard, ^Sermo de Beata Maria Virgine~, compares 
Mary to a rose, Eve to a thorn: G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l' 
ordine del `Paradiso' dantesco~, I, 1911, 227-228. -- |Da' suoi 
piedi~, `at her (Mary's) feet.' 

	|11.  Bisava~, `great-grandmother': Ruth. -- |Cantor~:
David. 

	|12.  Fallo~, `sin': 2 Samuel xi-xii. -- |Miserere mei~, 
`have mercy upon me.'  Ps. li (Vulg. l), 1. 

	|14.  Gi@u digradar~, `in graded descent.' -- |A proprio 
nome~, `with the name of each.' 

	|18.  Dirimendo~, `parting.' -- The `locks of the flower'
are its petals, and the petals of the rose are presumably the 
sections of seats in the amphitheatre. -- The line of Hebrew 
women cuts through all the rows from top to bottom.  The first 
seven have been named; the rest are not. 

	|19-20.  Secondo~ etc., `according to the look which Faith
turned on Christ': i.e., according as the Faith of the Hebrews
looked forward to Christ to come, or the Faith of the Christians
looked back to Christ crucified.  On one side of the partition
(made by the line of Jewesses) are the Hebrews, on the other the
Christians. 

	|25-26.  Onde~ etc., `where the semicircles are broken by 
empty space': where some seats, here and there, are still vacant.

	|28.  Quinci~, `on this side.' 

	|30.  Cerma~, `division.' 

	|31.  Mat.~  xi, 11: `Among them that are born of women 
there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.'  Cf.
^Purg.~ XXII, 153. 

	|32.  Sempre santo~: `he shall be filled with the Holy
Ghost, even from his mother's womb' (Luke i, 15). -- |Diserto~:
cf. ^Purg.~ XXII, 151-152; ^Par.~ XVIII, 134. -- |Martiro~: cf.
^Par.~ XVIII, 135. 

	|33.  Inferno~: the Limbus where John, after his death, had
to wait some two years for the descent of Christ to rescue the
souls of the just. 

	|34.  Cerner sortiro~ seems to mean `have assigned
division,' i.e., have constructed the dividing line.  Cf. XXXI,
69. 

	|35.~  St. Augustine, the founder of Theology, and St.
Benedict (XXII, 28) and St. Francis (XI, 43), the great founders
of orders, may be regarded as successors of John the Baptist. 
Cf. Luke i, 17. 

	|38-39.~  After the Last Judgment, the souls from the Old
Church will be exactly equal in number to those from the New. 

	|40.  Dal grado in gi@u~, `below that tier.' -- |Fiede~, 
`cuts.' 

	|41.  A mezzo il tratto~, `half way down.' -- |Discrezioni~,
`divisions': the two sides of the rose. 

	|43.  L'altrui~, `thy merit of others' (one's parents). --
|Condizioni~: cf. ll. 79-84. 

	|44.  Assolti~, `released' from the flesh. 

	|45.  Elezioni~, `choice': exercise of the free will. 

	|46-48.~  According to the usual opinion, the bodies of all
the elect will rise, at the Resurrection, in the aspect of the
prime of life.  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu.
lxxxi, Art. 1-2.  So they are commonly pictured in mediaeval art.
In his striking departure from current belief, Dante was 
influenced certainly by a desire for significant visible
contrast, and also, we may conjecture, by that love of little 
children which he has more than once revealed.  The sweet 
conception of an encircling sea of baby faces, all twittering 
with baby voices, must have charmed him as it charms us. 

	|49.  Sili~ (Latin ^siles)~ = ^taci.~ -- Dante is silently
wondering why, if these children never won merit by the exercise
of their free will, some have higher seats than others.  He
learns presently that the degree of beatitude (symbolized by the
height of the seat) is determined by predestination, not by one's
own acts: cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu. cxii.

	|53.~  `Not a particle of chance can find a place.'
Everything has a definite cause. 

	|54.  Se non come~, `any more than.' 

	|56-57.  Giustamente~ etc., `there is exact correspondence.'

	|58-59.~  `And therefore this company, hurried to the true
life is not ^sine causa'~ (Latin: `without cause'). 

	|61.  Pausa~, `rests.' 

	|63.  @E di pi@u ausa~, `ventures upon more.'  Cf. ^oso~ 
in ^Purg.~ XI, 126, XX, 149; ^Par.~ XIV, 130. 

	|64-66.~  Cf. Peter Lombard, ^Sententiae~, III, xxxii:
`Electorum alios magis alios minus dilexit.' -- |Effetto~,
`fact.'  Do not seek the wherefore of God's grace.  -- See ^Summa
Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu. cxii. 

	|67-69.~  Jacob and Esau `struggled together' in their 
mother's womb: Gen. xxv, 22-25.  Cf. Malachi, i, 2-3: `I have
loved you, saith the Lord.  Yet ye say, wherein hast thou loved
us?  Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved 
Jacob.  And I hated Esau.'  So Romans ix, 10-15: `And not only
this; but when Rebecca also had conceived...: (For the children
being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that
the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of 
works, but of him that calleth;) It was said unto her, The elder
shall serve the younger.  As it is written, Jacob have I loved,
but Esau have I hated.  What shall we say then? Is there 
unrighteousness with God?  God forbid.  For he saith to Moses, I
will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.'  See ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xxiii, Art. 3. 

	|70-72.~  `Therefore the heavenly light must crown us fitly,
according to the complexion of that grace.'  Our halo, or reward,
in Heaven is proportionate to the grace bestowed on us at birth. 
For ^s' incappelli~, cf. XXV, 9.  The odd expression, `the color
of the hair of that grace,' was evidently suggested by Esau's red
hair: Gen. xxv, 25.  Esau, without apparent reason, differed in
looks from Jacob, just as he difered from him in character and in
divine favor. 

	|73.  Merz@e~, `merit.' -- |Costume~, `conduct.' 

	|75.  Primiero acume~, `primal keenness' of spiritual sight,
which is bestowed by Grace. 

	|76.  Recenti~, `new,' fresh from creation: before Abraham.
`New' is the original meaning of ^recens.~ -- Cf. ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. lxx, Art. 2. 

	|80-81.~  `It was requisite for the males to win strength
for the wings of innocence by circumcision.'  Cf. ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. lxx, Art. 2: `Circumcisio instituta est
ut signum fidei Abrahae, qui credidit se patrem futurum Christi
sibi repromissi; et ideo convenienter solis maribus competebat.
Peccatum etiam originale, contra quod specialiter circumcisio 
ordinabatur, a patre trahitur, non a matre.'  See Prima Secundae,
Qu. lxxxi, Art. 5.  Cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 37-38. 

	|82-84.~  After the Crucifixion, the unbaptized innocent 
children were `confined below' in the Limbus: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 30,
34-36.  Since the Redemption, there has been no salvation without
baptism in Christ.  See ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. lxx, Art.
2: `Baptismus in se continet perfectionem salutis, ad quam Deus
omnes homines vocat...Circumcisio autem non continebat 
perfectionem salutis, sed figurabat ipsam ut fiendam per
Christum.'  Cf. Tertia, Qu. lxi. -- For the fourth and last time,
we have a series of rimes in |Cristo.~ 

	|89.  Menti~: the heavenly Intelligences, or angels. 

	|94.  Amor~: the angel Gabriel.  Cf. XXIII, 94-96. -- L@i:
upon her (at the Annunciation). 

	|95.~  Luke i, 28: `Hail, thou that art highly favoured.' 

	|99.  Vista~, `face.' 

	|100.  Comporte~, `endurest.' 

	|107.  Abbelliva di~, `grew beautiful with.' 

	|114.  Salma~: the `burden' of human sin. 

	|119.  Augusta~, `the Empress': Mary.  Augusta was an 
established title for the wife of the Emperor: see Tor.  Cf. XXX,
136. 

	|121.  Le s' aggiusta~, `is next to her.' 

	|124.  Vetusto~, `ancient.' 

	|125.~  Mat. xvi, 19.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 91-92. 

	|126.  Venusto~, `lovely.' 

	|127.~  St. John, the author of the Apocalypse. 

	|128.  Sposa~: the Church. 

	|129.  Lancia~: John xix, 34.  Cf. XIII, 40. -- |Chiavi~,
`nails.' 

	|130.  Esso~: Peter. -- |L' altro~: Adam. 

	|131.  Duca~, `leader': Moses.  See Exod. xvi, 14-35. 

	|133.  Anna~: St. Anna, mother of Mary. 

	|135.  Per cantare~, `while singing.' 

	|137.  Lucia~: St. Lucia, the type of Illumining Grace, who
has twice come to Dante's aid: ^Inf.~ II, 97-108; ^Purg.~ IX,
55-63. 

	|138.~  `When thou wast bending thy brows to fall': ^Inf.~
I, 61.  Lucia sent Beatrice to save Dante at the time when the
wolf was driving him back into the wooded valley. 

	|139.~  If, as seems likely, |t' assonna~ means `holds thee
in sleep,' this passage affords the only evidence that Dante's
experience is a dream.  Nearly all the mediaeval accounts of the
other world are cast in the form of dreams or visions. 

	|145.  Veramente~, `but.' -- |N@e~, `lest': a Latinism. 

	|146.  Oltrarti~, `to advance:' 

	|147.~  `Grace must be obtained by prayer.' 

	|148.  Quella~: the Blessed Virgin. 

	|149.~  Some texts have ^segui.~ 

	|150.  Dicer~, `speech.' -- |Parti~ = (^tu~) ^parta~, `thou 
divide.'
