	|1.~  The beautiful prayer to the Blessed Virgin, with which
this canto opens, is quite in the style of St. Bernard.  A great
part of it was copied by Chaucer in the ^Second Nun's Tale~,
29-84.  Such an intercession is wholly in accordance with
Catholic practice. 

	|10.  Face~, `torch.' 

	|13-15.~  Cf. St. Bernard, ^Sermones in Vigilia Nativitatis
Domini~, III, x: `Nihil nos Deus habere voluit, quod per Mariae
manus non transiret.' -- |Qual~, `whosoever.' -- |Vuol volar
sanz' ali~, `is trying to fly without wings,' seems to have been
a standing phrase: ^Bull.~, XVIII, 21. 

	|22.  Questi~: Dante. -- |Lacuna~, `pool': the lake of ice
at the centre of the earth.  St. Thomas calls stagnant waters
^lacunae~ in ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xviii, Art. 1.  The
`lions' den' is ^lacus leonum~ in Dan. vi, 7, 12, 37. -- The 
reference is to Dante's experiences on his upward journey. 

	|25-26.  Di virtute tanto~, `for so much strength.' 

	|31.  Perch@e~, `that.' -- |Disleghi~, `dispel.' -- Cf. 
^Cons.~, III, Metr. ix, 25-26: 

     `Disjice terrenae nebulas et pondera molis, 
     Atque tuo splendore mica.' 

	|44.  S' invii~, `is sped'; the subject is ^l' occhio~ in l.
45.  Other texts have ^s' inii~ (a word constructed from ^io~),
`sinks itself.' 

	|45.  Per creatura~, `by any creature.' 

	|52.  Venendo sincera~, `growing pure.' 

	|57.  Oltraggio~, `excess.' 

	|58.  Somniando~ = ^sognando~, which is the reading of 
some texts. 

	|59.  Passione~, `emotion.' 

	|62.  Distilla~, `drips.' -- Both the sweetness and the 
thinness of the recollection are reflected by the tinkling rime
in -^illa.~ 

	|64.  Si disigilla~, `is unsealed': melts away. 

	|65-66.~  The Cumaean Sibyl was accustomed to write her 
prophecies on loose tree-leaves, which, whenever a wind arose,
were scattered about and lost: ^Aen.~, III, 441-451. 

	|68.  Dai~, `above.' 

	|71.  Favilla~ is the object of ^lasciare~ in l. 72. -- 
|Sol~ = ^sola.~ 

	|73.  Per tornare~, `by returning.' 

	|76-78.~  When we turn from gazing on a light, our eyes are
blurred for everything else: cf. XXV, 118-120.  So the sight of
God makes all other vision seem confused and meaningless. --
|Aversi~, `averted.' 

	|80.  Per Questo~, `on that account': because I felt sure
that I could see nothing else. 

	|81.  Aspetto~, `gaze.' 

	|82.  Presunsi~, `presumed.' -- To behold the divine 
essence our human sight must be fortified by divine 
enlightenment: St. Thomas, ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei contra
Gentiles~, III, liv. 

	|84.  Consunsi~, `spent': cf. XXVI, 5.  I looked with such
intentness that I became blind to all else. 

	|85.  S' interna~, `is contained.' 

	|86.~  God is the Book of the Universe.  Cf. ^Purg.~ III,
126. 

	|87.  Si squaderna~, `is spread.' 

	|88.~  Nothing being accidental in God, the distinction 
between substance and accident does not exist in him: ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. iii, Art. 6. -- |Costume~, `habit.' 

	|89-90.~  `Fused together, as it were, in such wise that 
that whereof I speak is one simple light' (cf. l. 109).  God, 
containing all things, is a perfect unit: see ^Summa Theologiae~,
Prima, Qu. iv, Art. 2.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXVIII, 16-21. 

	|91-93.~  Painfully groping in his memory, the poet is 
encouraged by a sense of satisfaction with his statement -- a 
reminiscence of the glow of contentment (the `passione impressa')
which came over him when he first comprehended the union of 
everything in God.  This feeling leads him to believe that his
report thus far has been correct. -- By `the universal form of
this knot' is meant the absolute principle of this union -- the
fusion of all things temporal and eternal in the Creator. -- |Di
largo~, `amply.' 

	|94-96.~  `One single moment, for me, means more
forgetfulness than 25 centuries have been for that adventure 
which made Neptune marvel at the shadow of Argo.'  The expedition
of the Argonauts, under Jason, in search of the golden fleece
(^Inf.~ XVIII, 86-87; ^Par.~ II, 16-18) was thought to have 
occurred in the 13th century B. C.  The Argo was the first ship
ever built: hence Neptune's surprise.  The general sense, then,
is this: in the first moment after my awakening (XXXII, 139) I
forgot more of my vision than mankind has forgotten, in 2500 
years, of the story of the Argonauts. 

	|100-102.~  `In that Light one becomes such that it is 
impossible ever to consent to turn from it to see aught else.'
Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae Qu. v, Art. 4: `Perfecta
beatitudo hominis in visione divinae essentiae consistit.  Est
autem impossibile quod aliquis videns divinam essentiam velit eam
non videre....Visio autem divinae essentiae replet animam omnibus
bonis, cum conjungat fonti totius bonitatis....Sic ergo patet 
quod propria voluntate beatus non potest beatitudinem deserere.' 

	|103.~  `Because good, which is the object of volition.' 

	|106-107.~  `Henceforth, even in the things I remember, my
speech will fall shorter than that of a babe.' 

	|114.  Si travagliava~, `was transformed.' 

	|117.  Continenza~, `dimension.' 

	|118.~  The circle representing the Son seemed reflected 
from the circle symbolizing the Father, just as one arch of a 
double rainbow is reflected by the other (cf. XII, 10-13) -- 
`Iris by Iris.'  Cf. XIII, 55-57. 

	|119.  Terzo~: the Holy Ghost emanates equally from Father
and Son.  Cf. X, 1-2. 

	|122.  Questo~: sc., ^concetto.~ -- |A~, `compared to.' 

	|123.  Tanto~, `such.' 

	|124.  Sidi~, `abidest.' 

	|125-126.~  Mat. xi, 27: `no man knoweth the Son, but the
Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son.'  Cf.
^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xxxiv, Art. 1: `Pater enim 
intelligendo se et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum...concipit Verbum.'

	|127.  Concetta~, `conceived,' generated. 

	|129.  Circunspetta~, `surveyed.' 

	|131.  Effige~, `image.'  Cf. Philippians, ii, 7. 

	|133-135.~  Cf. ^Mon.~, III, iii, 9-10: `geometra circuli
quadraturam ignorat.' Also ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 217-219: `il cerchio
per lo suo arco @e impossibile a quadrare perfettamente.' -- 
|Geometra~, `geometer.' -- |S' affige~, `applies himself.' -- 
|Misurar~: the problem is the squaring of the circle. --
|Indige~, `is in need.' 

	|137.  Si convenne~, `conformed.' 

	|138.  S' indova~, `it finds a place.' 

	|139.  Penne~, `wings.' 

	|142.~  Cf. ^Conv.~, III, iv, 87-95: `il nostro intelietto,
per difetto della virt@u della quale trae quello ch' el vede (che
@e virt@u organica), cio@e la fantasia, non puote a certe cose
salire, perocch@e la fantasia nol puote aiutare, ch@e non ha il
di che; siccome sono le Sustanze partite da materia; delle quali
se alcuna considerazione di quelle avere potemo, intendere non le
potemo, n@e comprendere perfettamente.'  Cf. also ^Par.~ XXIV,
24. 

	|143.  Velle~ (Latin), `will.' -- |Disiro~ and |velle~ 
are objects of |volgeva~, the subject of which is ^Amor~ in l.
145. -- St. Thomas, in ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei contra~ 
^Gentiles~, III, xxv, tells us that, inasmuch as the knowledge of
God is the natural goal of man's desire, no other knowledge can
suffice for human happiness. 

	|144.~  The circle, being the perfect figure, is an emblem
of perfection; and circular motion symbolizes full and faultless
activity.  St. Thomas, ^In Librum B. Dionysii De Divinis
Nominibus~, Caput iv, Lectio 7: `Et ideo circularitas motus
animae completur in hoc quod ad Deum manuducit.'  In ^V. N.~,
XII, 2634, we read that while Love in the abstract is comparable
to a circle, Dante, the earthly lover, is not; but at the end of
his journey, in the presence of his Maker, Dante's love is made
perfect, `like a wheel in even revolution.'  See J. B. Fletcher
in ^The Nation~ (New York), Dec. 29, 1910. 

	|145.~  The stars, at which the poet has gazed wistfully 
from below, are now beneath him.  Their conformity to God's plan
is not more complete than his, nor is their rotation more perfect
than the movement of his desire and will.
