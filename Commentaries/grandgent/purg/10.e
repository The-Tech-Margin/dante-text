	|Proemio.~ PURGATORY proper consists of seven flat, narrow terraces
running around the mountain and separated from one another by
steep cliffs.  On each shelf are souls doing penance for one
of the
capital vices -- pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice and
prodigality
gluttony, lust.  These wicked dispositions are the source of
all sin. 
Inasmuch as pride is an ingredient in every transgression
(which
is an assumption of superiority to law), all souls have to
suffer in
the first circle; in the ensuing circles they are punished
according
to the nature of their wrongdoing.  The terraces are connected
by
stairways cut into the precipice.  When a spirit has cleansed
itself
of the evil that is expiated on one shelf, it passes on upward
to the
next terrace that claims it -- or, if it has no other stain,
to the
top of the mountain.  At the beginning of each ascent a
friendly
angel is seen, who removes the last impress of the discarded
vice;
and a beatitude (Mat. v, 3-8) is heard, appropriate to the
circle
that is left below.  To sustain them, the souls are furnished,
on
every terrace, with examples of the particular sin that
belongs
to that spot, and of the opposite virtue.  The latter examples
--
the 'goad' -- generally appear to Dante as he enters each
circle,
the former -- the 'check' -- as he is about to depart from it. 
They take different shapes on the various shelves; on the
first,
they present themselves to the eye as beautiful carvings on
the
upright wall of the mountain and on the floor.  These
illustrations
of good and evil are drawn from both Christian and pagan lore,
but the first example of each of the seven virtues is taken
from the
life of the Virgin.  In the ^Speculum Beatae Maria Virginis~
by Friar
Conrad of Saxony, a Franciscan contemporary of St.
Bonaventure,
the Virtues of the Virgin are opposed to the seven vices:
Gardner,
254-5.

	Allegorically the torments cheerfully endured on the
several
terraces represent the forms of discipline to which the sinner
must
subject himself, under priestly direction, in order to restore
his
lost innocence and thus fit himself for Heaven.  In the first
circle
for instance, the spirits crouching under heavy burdens are
the
image of self-imposed humiliation, the painful subjugation of
pride.  Dante's journey up through Purgatory signifies the
moral
training by means of which, obedient to ecclesiastical
authority
he removes from his soul every disposition to evil and regains
the purity of heart that enables him to see God.  While in the
literal sense of the poem he is only an observer of the
spirits and
their punishments, symbolically he is himself the punished
spirit;
in the circles of pride, envy, anger, and lust, -- if we look
for the
inner beneath the external meaning, -- we can see the poet in
the
throes of penance.

	For the carvings, see H. D. Austin, ^The Arrangement of
Dante's
Purgatorial Reliefs~ in ^Publications of the Modern Language
Association of America~, XVII, 1.

	|2.~  Love wrongly directed, so perverts human souls that
few of them attain Purgatory: the gate falls into disuse. 

	|5.~  Cf. IX, 131-2. 

	|8.~  The narrow crack by which the poets ascend runs zigzag
up through the cliff. 

	|12.  Si parte~, `recedes.'  The climbers have to cling now
to one side, now to the other, according to the changing
direction of the crack.

	|14.~  `Lo scemo della luna': the waning moon, which, of
course, sets later than the full moon; it is several hours after
sunrise. 

	|16.  Cruna~, `needle's eye,' i.e., the narrow passage: cf.
Mat. xix, 24. 

	|18.  Si rauna~, `gathers itself': withdraws, leaving a flat
terrace. 

	|24.  Misurrebbe~ = ^misurerebbe.~  The width of the shelf,
from its outer edge to the foot of the upright cliff, is three
times the length of a human body. 

	|25.  Trar d'ale~, `fly.' 

	|30.~  `Which, being vertical, was devoid of ascent,' i.e.,
could not be climbed.  Some texts have ^dritto.~

	|32.~  The Greek sculptor, Polycletus, was known by name to
mediaeval writers. 

	|33.  Avrebbe scorno~, `would have been put to shame.' 

	|34.~  `The angel' is Gabriel.  The first example of
humility represents the Virgin at the Annunciation.  Cf. Luke i,
26 ff. 

	|40.  Ave~, `hail,' the greeting of Gabriel to Mary: Luke i,
28. 

	|44.~  `Behold the handmaid of the Lord,' Mary's reply to
Gabriel: Luke i, 38. 

	|47-48.~  Virgil had Dante on his left.  On Virgil's right
was another carving. 

	|52.  Imposta~, `designed': cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 18. 

	|53.  Fe'mi~ = ^mi feci.~ 

	|56.~  The second example of humility pictures King David
dancing `with all his might' before the ark of the covenant, as
it is drawn into the city on a `new cart': 2 Samuel vi, 12-6. 

	|57.~  We have here a brief, parenthetical reference to an
incident not represented in the carving -- the story of Uzzah,
which makes us chary of assuming offices not entrusted to us.
Uzzah, one of the drivers of the cart, seeing the ark shaken and
fearing it would fall, `put forth his hand...and took hold of
it'; whereupon `God smote him' for his presumption, and `there he
died': 2 Samuel vi, 3-7. 

	|59.~  The `seven choirs' appear in the Vulgate, but not in
the English Bible: 2 Samuel vi, 12. 

	|61.  Fummo~ = ^fumo.~ 

	|63.  Fensi~ = ^si fecero.~ 

	|65.  Alzato~: `and David was ^girded~ with a linen ephod'
(2 Samuel vi, 14).  When he returned home, his wife, Michal,
Saul's daughter, reproached him for uncovering himself `in the
eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows
shamelessly uncovereth himself': 2 Samuel vi, 20. 

	|66.~  David replied to Michal: `I will yet be more vile
than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the
maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in
honour' (2 Samuel vi, 22). 

	|67.  Vista~, `view-point,' `outlook.' `Michal Saul's
daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and
dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart': 2
Samuel vi, 16. 

	|68.  Ammirava~, `looked on.' 

	|74.~  The third example of humility is furnished by Trajan,
the `Roman prince' who acknowledged the justice of the poor
widow's claim.  For the origin of this story, which had wide
currency in the Middle Ages, see G. Paris, ^La l$egende de
Trajan~ in the ^Biblioth@eque de l'$Ecole des hautes $etudes~,
1878; A. Graf, ^Roma nella memoria e nelle immaginazioni del
medio evo~, 1889, II, 1; ^Giorn. dant.~, XIV, 199; R. Davidsohn,
^Firenze ai tempi di Dante~, 479. 

	|75.~  According to a legend universally believed in Dante's
time, St. Gregory was so moved by the thought of Trajan's justice
that he interceded with God for him; whereupon Trajan's soul was
allowed to return from Limbus to earth and inhabit its body long
enough to embrace Christianity, thus winning salvation: cf.
^Par.~ XX, 43-8, 106-17.  This was the `great victory.' 

	|78.  Atteggiata~, `in attitude.' 

	|80.  Aguglie~ = ^aquile~: the Roman eagles on a golden
background, in banners. 

	|81.  Movieno~ = ^movevano.~ 

	|88.  Chi fia dov' io~, `he who shall be in my place.' 

	|89-90.~ `What shall another's welldoing avail thee?' 

	|94.  Colui~: God. 

	|106.  Ti smaghi~, `be distraught': cf. XXVII, 104.  Dante
fears that the horror of the penance may divert the reader from
his `good resolution' to make amends. 

	|109.  Non attender~, `heed not.'  Cf. Romans viii, 18. 

	|110.  Succession~, `consequence.' 

	|111.~  In any case the suffering will stop at the day of
judgment. 

	|112.  Veggio~ = ^vedo.~ 

	|117.  Tencione~, `controversy.' 

	|118.  Disviticchia~, `disentangle.' 

	|124.~  Cf. Job xxv, 6: `man, that is a worm.' 

	|125.~  Cf. Mat. xxii, 30: `For in the resurrection
they...are as the angels of God in heaven.' 

	|127.  Di che~, `wherefore.' -- |Galla~, `soars.' 

	|128.  Entomata in difetto~, `defective insects.'  The Greek
word is %epsilon%nu%tau%o%mu%o%nu\, pl.
%epsilon%nu%tau%o%mu%alpha\.  Dante probably found ^entoma~ in 
his Latin version of Aristotle, and, taking it for a singular, 
formed a plural on the model of ^poema~, ^poemata~, and other 
words. 

	|129.  Falla~ `is lacking.'  Albertus Magnus speaks of the
incompleteness of caterpillars and such creatures: ^De
Animalibus~, XVII, Tract. ii, Cap. 1, beginning. 

	|130.  Solaio~, `ceiling,' `loft.' 

	|131.  Mensola~, `corbel,' `bracket.' 

	|133.~  The `unreal' suffering of the caryatid arouses a
`real pang' of pity in the beholder.  In the Florentine
Baptistery, caryatids support a round Paradise in mosaic:
^Speculum~, I, 1.  There was a caryatid at the head of a stairway
in the castle of Poppi: Torraca in ^Nuovi Studi danteschi~, 409-
10. 

	|138-139.~  Even the most patient among them seemed to be at
the limit of his endurance.
