	|2.~  Ten years: from June, 1290, to April, 1300. 

	|3.~  Cf. IV, 1-12.  The same fact was noted by Ristoro d'
Arezzo and Fra Giordano: see Tor., 612. 

	|4.  Essi~: the eyes. 

	|5.  Non caler~, `indifference.' 

	|6.  Tra$eli~ = ^li traeva.~ 

	|8.~  The `Divinities' to which this reference is made are
the three Christian Virtues. 

	|9.~  By `Too fixedly!' the Virtues remind Dante that 
Revelation cannot be directly comprehended, in its entirety, by 
the ordinary human mind, but can be best understood through its 
manifestation in the Church.  A similar warning is uttered by 
Beatrice herself in ^Par.~ XVIII, 21. 

	|10.  @Ee~ = ^@e~: cf. IV, 47.  So in l. 12 ^fee~ = ^fe~ 
= ^fece.~ -- `The ability to see that is in eyes,' etc., i.e.,
the dazzled condition.  The contemplation of divine mysteries
blinds mortal man to material reality. 

	|13.  Poco~: sc. ^sensibile~ (l. 15), `perceptibility,'
i.e., visibility, the light of the procession. -- |Viso~,
`sight.' -- |Riformossi~, `readjusted itself.'

	|19.~  The figure is that of a troop of soldiers retreating,
with their shields locked over their heads. 

	|20.~  `A rank turns, and wheels with its standard.' 

	|21.~  `Before it can completely face about.' 

	|24.~  The candlesticks and the 24 elders all `passed us' 
`before the chariot bent its first wood,' i.e., its pole, which 
is the Cross. 

	|25.~  The seven Virtues returned to their two wheels (XXIX,
121, 13O), which they had left (XXXI, 109, 131). 

	|27.~  `In such wise that not a feather of him shook
withal': Christ set the Church in motion, by means of the Cross,
without disturbing in any way his divine part. 

	|28.~  Matilda: XXXI, 91-104. 

	|30.~  The wheel `that made its turn with the smaller curve'
is the right wheel, inasmuch as the chariot is turning to the
right.  Dante and Statius, with Matilda, join the Theological
Virtues. 

	|32.  Colpa~ is used like the Latin ablative, ^culpa~, 
`through the fault.' -- |Crese~ = ^credette.~ 

	|35.  Disfrenata~, `loosed' from the string. -- |Eramo~ 
(Latinism) ^eravamo~ -- Cf. ^Met.~, VIII, 695-6; ^Thebaid~, VI, 
354. 

	|37.~  Cf. 4 Esdras vii, 48: `O thou Adam what hast thou
done?  For though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen 
alone, but we all that come of thee.' 

	|40.  Coma~, `tresses,' i.e., branches. 

	|41.~  India was famous for high trees: cf. Virgil,
^Georgics~, II, 122-4.  For a symbolical tree of great height, 
cf. Daniel iv, 10-2, 20-2. 

	|43.  Discindi~, `breakest off.'  Cf. ^Mon.~, III, x, 34-6:
`Sed contra officium deputatum Imperatori est ^scindere~
imperium.' -- See ^Mon.~, II, xii, xiii; Mat. xxii, 21. 

	|45.  `For the belly is sadly racked afterwards.' 

	|47.  Binato~, `dual,' of two natures. 

	|48.~  Mat. iii, 15: `For thus it becometh us to fulfil all
righteousness' -- `Sic enim decet nos implere ^omnem justitiam.~' 
Cf. Rom. v, 19: `For as by one man's disobedience many were made
sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
righteous.' -- Justice is identical with the divine will: 
^Mon.~, II, ii, 39-61. 

	|49.  Temo~ (cf. XXII, 119) = ^timone~, `pole': the Cross. 

	|50.  Frasca~, `trunk.' 

	|53.~  When the sun's light descends `mingled with that' of
Aries, -- the constellation which follows Pisces, the `heavenly
carp,' -- it is spring. 

	|57.~  The `next constellation' to which the sun `hitches 
his steeds' is Taurus, which follows Aries. 

	|58.~  The color between red and violet is the Imperial 
purple. 

	|60.  Ramora~ = ^rami~, `branches.'

as it were a new song before the throne...: and no man could
learn that song...'

	|65.~  The hundred eyes of Argus, the guardian of Io (cf.
XXIX, 95), were put to sleep by Mercury's song of the nymph
Syrinx, loved by Pan; Mercury then slew the over-vigilant 
guardian: ^Met.~, I, 568-747. 

	|69.~  `But let him who will make a good counterfeit 
presentment of the act of falling asleep!' -- |Qual vuol sia~, 
`let it be he who wishes.'  Cf. Patecchio's phrase, `cui illi vol
sia': E. Monaci, ^Crestomazia italiana~, I, 102, l. 17. 

	|73-78.~  `As Peter, John, and James, led to behold the 
flowerlets of that appletree which makes the angels greedy for 
its fruit and holds eternal wedding feasts in Heaven, and, 
overwhelmed at that sight, came to themselves at the sound of 
that voice by which deeper sleep had been broken...' 

	|73.  Quali~ is correlative with ^tal~ in l. 82. -- |A
veder~ is to be connected both with ^condotti~, l. 76, and with 
^vinti~, l. 77. -- |Fioretti~: the foretaste of Christ's glory. 
-- |Melo~: Christ.  Cf. Song of Solomon ii, 3: `As the apple tree
among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.' 

	|74.  Pomo~: the full glory of Christ.  Cf. Rev. xviii, 14:
`the fruits that thy soul lusted after' -- `^poma~ desiderii
animae tuae'; I Peter i, 12: `which things the angels desire to 
look into.' 

	|75.~  Rev. xix, 9: `Blessed are they which are called unto
the marriage supper of the Lamb.' 

	|76.~  Mat. xvii, 1.  Peter, John, and James,
representatives of the three Christian virtues, conduct Dante's
examination in these virtues in Heaven: Par. XXIV-XXVI.  If Dante
realiy had a son Giovanni (see Introduction, par. 2), his three
sons bore the names of these disciples.  See ^Giorn. stor.~,
LXXXII, 200. 

	|77.~  Mat. xvii, 5-7. 

	|78.  Maggior sonni~: the sleep of death.  Cf. Luke vii,
14-5; John xi, 43-4. 

	|79.~  `And saw their company diminished': Mat. xvii, 8. 

	|80.~  `Both by Moses and by Elias': Mat. xvii, 3. 

	|81.~  `And their Master's raiment changed,' no longer
`white as the light,' as it had been at the moment of the 
Transfiguration: Mat. xvii, 2. 

	|87.~  Beatrice sits upon the root of the tree: Revelation
(Religion) and Law (Empire) come from the same source.

	|88.  Compagnia~: the Virtues. 

	|93.  Quella~: Beatrice. -- |Intender~, `attention.' 

	|94.~  Beatrice the divine, has descended to the `real
earth,' where she is graciously putting herself at the disposal 
of even the lowliest through the medium of the Church.

51. 

	|97.  Claustro~, `ring.' 

	|98.  Lumi~: the candlesticks. 

	|99.~  `Which are safe from Aquilo and Auster,' the north 
and the south wind: which no physical blast can extinguish.  For
a special appropriateness of "north" and "south," see H. D. 
Austin, ^Di alcune metafore controverse nell' opera di Dante~, 
1932, 29. 

	|100.  Silvano~, `forester.'  Thou shalt dwell a little
while on earth. 

	|101.  Cive~, `citizen.'  Then thou shalt dwell forever in
Heaven.  Cf. Ephesians ii, 19: `fellow-citizens with the saints,
and of the household of God.' 

	|103.  In pro~, `for the benefit.' 

	|105.  Scrive~ = ^scriva.~  Cf. Rev. i, II: `What thou

	|110.  Spessa~, `dense.' -- |Piove~, `it (the lightning)
falls': cf. ^Bull.~, XVI, 147.

like the foxes in the deserts.' 

	|121.  Riprendendo~, `rebuking.' -- |Laide~, `ugly.' 

	|122.  Futa~, `flight.' 

	|123.~  `Such as its fleshless bones permitted.' 

	|125.~  The `ark,' like the `cradle' above, means the body
of the chariot. 

	|129.~  According to a familiar legend, after the donation
of Constantine a voice from Heaven was heard crying: `Hodie
difusum est venenum in Ecclesia Dei.' -- For Dante's views on the
donation, see ^Mon.~, III, x. 

	|135.~  `It pulled out some of the bottom, and twisted and
twined itself away.' 

	|136.  Come~, etc., as `live earth' does `with dog's grass.'

	|140.  In tanto~: so quickly. 

	|142.  Dificio~, `engine' (cf. ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 7): the
