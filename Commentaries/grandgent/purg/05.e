	|Proemio.~ THE  third class of the 'negligent' comprises those who,
cut
short by a violent death, repented at their last gasp.  They
come
wandering horizontally across the mountain-side.  Their
principal
spokesman is Count Buonconte da Montefeltro, a Ghibelline
leader, captain of the Aretines in the disastrous battle of
Campaldino in 1289.  There he met his death, but, as we are
told by
Dante (who almost certainly took part in this fight), his body
was
not found on the field.  This curious circumstance allows the
poet
to introduce a romantic account of Buonconte's end -- his
appeal
to Mary with his dying breath, his salvation 'by one little
tear'
of genuine contrition, and the contest between angel and demon
for
the possession of his soul.  Such a conflict we find portrayed
in
ancient Etruscan art, and, in Christian times, described as
early
as Gregory I and Bede.  In the ^Commedia~ it occurs -- with a
different outcome -- in only one other instance, that of
Buonconte's
father, Guido (^Inf.~ XXVII, 112-29), whose fate is thus
contrasted with his son's.  By means of these two extreme
examples Dante illustrates the dependence of everlasting
welfare
or perdition upon the real fitness of the soul at the instant
of
departure.

	The foiled devil wreaks his vengeance on the corpse.  He
conjures up a storm, and Buonconte's body is swept into the
Arno.  
In Ephesians ii, 2, the fiend is called 'prince of the power
of the
air.'  According to St. Thomas, the elements are subject to
spiritual
beings; and demons, who dwell partly in Hell and partly in
the dark air, are able to produce wind and rain.

	For Guido da Montefeltro, see Argument to ^Inf.~ XXVII. 
For the
contest between angel and devil: Gregory I, ^Dialogi~, IV,

	|4.  Ve'~ = ^vedi.~ 

	|5.~  As Dante is climbing straight up the east side of the
mountain, facing west, -- the sun being now in the north, -- his
shadow falls on the left (or south) side. 

	|16.  Rampolla~, `sprouts.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXIII, 10; ^Par.~
IV, 130. 

	|17.~  The man in whose mind one thought immediately begets
a different one `puts the target further from him,' i.e., makes
his goal more difficult of attainment.  Dante is particularly
fond of metaphors taken from archery. 

	|18.~  `Because the one weakens the force of the other.' 

	|21.~  Shame is becoming in women and youths, not in mature
men: cf. ^Conv.~, IV, xix, 82-92. 

	|22.  Di traverso~, `crosswise.' 

	|24.~  Ps. li (Vulg. l): `Have mercy upon me, O God.' -- |A
verso a verso~ probably indicates a division of the singers into
two choirs, which sing the verses alternately. 

	|28.  Messaggi~ = ^messaggeri~: cf. XXII, 78. 

	|29.  Dimandarne~ = ^ci domandarono.~ 

	|36.~  `It may profit them,' because they are in need of the
prayers of the living, which Dante may procure for them. 

	|37.  Vapori accesi~ comprise both meteors and lightning.
Meteors, cleaving the clear sky in the early night, and
lightning, cleaving the August clouds at sunset, move less
swiftly than the messengers. 

	|40.~  `(So swiftly) that they (the messengers) did not go
up again in less (time).' 

	|41.  Dier~ (= ^diedero~) |volta~, `turned.' 

	|57.  N' accora~, `saddens us.' 

	|58.  Perch@e...guati~, `though I gaze.' 

	|62.  S@i fatta~, `such.' 

	|63.  Face~ = ^fa.~ 

	|66.~  `Provided inability cut not short thy (good) will.' 

	|69.~  The March of Ancona is the country between the
Romagna and the land of Charles -- i.e., the kingdom of Naples,
which belonged to Charles II of Anjou.  The speaker is Jacopo del
Cassero, a leading citizen of Fano, who in 1296 was mayor of
Bologna.  He fell out with Azzo VIII of Este, and in 1298, while
on his way to take the place of mayor of Milan, he was murdered
by the marquis's hirelings. 

	|73.  Fori~, `wounds.' 

	|74.  In sul quale io sedea~, `in which I (the soul) dwelt.'
Cf. Levit. xvii, 14: `anima enim omnis carnis in sanguine est';
the English version is not so close -- `for the life of all flesh
is the blood thereof.' 

	|75.~  The territory of the Paduans.  According to an
ancient tradition, Padua was founded by Antenor (cf. ^Aen.~, I,
247-9), who, as we have seen, was regarded as an arch-traitor:
see the second paragraph of the Argument to ^Inf.~ XXXII. 

	|78.  Pi@u l@a che~, `beyond what.'  For another
interpretation, see ^Giorn. stor.~, LXVIII, 128. 

	|79.~  Mira is a village between Padua and Or,iaco, now
Oriago.  The speaker cannot forgive himself for having, in his
terror, turned in the wrong direction, when he was `overtaken' by
the assassins: had he fled toward the village, instead of running
into the swamp, he might still be in the land of the living, in
which case he would have repented in due season and so spared
himself, after death, this long waiting outside of Purgatory. 

	|81.  Spira~ = ^respira.~ 

	|82.  Palude~ was in popular use, beside ^padule~; cf.
^Par.~ IX, 46.  Some texts have, in the rime, ^brago~, ^lago~,
^Oriago~; ^brago~ (like ^fatiga~, ^spiga~, etc.) belongs rather
to western and southern Tuscany. 

	|85.~  The |se~, with the subjunctive, ^compia~, is
hortative: cf. II, 16; also ^Inf.~ X, 82. 

	|89.~  Giovanna was his wife. 

	|94.~  The Casentino is a mountainous district in Tuscany,
on the upper Arno. 

	|95.~  The Archiano is a mountain torrent that runs into the
Arno not very far from Bibbiena.  See Bassermann, p. 103. 

	|96.~  The `Hermitage' is the monastery of Camaldoli,
founded, in the mountains, by St. Romualdo in the 11th century. 

	|97.~  The `name' of the Archiano `becomes useless' when it
joins the Arno.

	|103.  Rid@i~ = ^ridici.~ 

	|108.  Governo~, `disposal.' 

	|112.~  The demon `combined that ill will, which seeks only
harm, with intelligence.' 

	|113.  Fummo~ = ^fumo.~ 

	|116.~  Pratomagno, a ridge on the southwest of the
Casentino, the `great chain' being the main range on the
northeast. 

	|117.  Intento~, `tense,' ready to burst. 

	|122.~  The `royal stream' is the Arno. 

	|125.  Rubesto~, `raging': cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 106. 

	|127.  Fe'~ = ^feci.~ 

	|129.~  For |preda~, see H. D. Austin in ^Giornale
dantesco~, XXXIII, N.S., ^Annuario dantesco~, III. 

	|132.~  The unexpected intervention of this `third spirit'
is as startling as her reticence is pathetic. 

	|133.~  Pia de' Tolomei of Siena, it was said, was wedded to
Nello della Pietra de' Pannocchieschi, who, wishing to marry
another woman, murdered her or had her murdered, in his castle in
the Tuscan Maremma: ^Bull.~, XVII, 125. 

	|135-136.  Salsi~ = ^se lo sa.~ `That he knows who, earlier,
had ringed me (encircled my finger) with his gem in wedlock
(|disposando).~'  For |disposando~ many texts have ^disposata~;
in ^Giorn. dant.~, XX, 153, L. Filomusi Guelfi proposes the
adoption of this reading (without the following comma) and the
interpretation of |innanellata~ (with a comma before it) as
`unwedded.'  See R. Davidsohn, ^Firenze ai tempi di Dante~, 631. 
Pia has been the heroine of many novels, stories, plays, and an
opera by Donizetti.
