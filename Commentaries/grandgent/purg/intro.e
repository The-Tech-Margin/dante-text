INTRODUCTION TO "PURGATORIO"

     In the beginning all eternal things were directly created
by
God -- namely, brute matter, the spheres, and the angels.  The
angels, operating by means of the heavenly bodies, constitute
Nature, the power that first resolved matter into its four
elements
and combined them into a globe of earth and water surrounded
by
air and fire.  God by his own act shaped Adam and Eve, whose
flesh is therefore imperishable; and every human soul is made
by
God.  The rest of the world is the work of Nature.  Even when
the Lord said (Gen. i, 9), 'Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land
appear,' it
was the influence of the stars (directed by angels) that
actually
caused the land to rise, on a part of the earth's surface,
above the
normally higher element.  According to Dante's cosmogony, the
earth is a sphere, solid except for the cavity of Hell; its
circumference is 20,400 miles.  Most of this spherical surface
is
covered by water, but in the Hemisphere of Land, -- which
lies, in the
main, north of the equator, -- is a great continent composed
of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, stretching from east to west 180+o~,
or
10,200 miles, between the Strait of Gibraltar and the mouth of
the
Ganges.  Its two western parts are separated by the
Mediterranean,
which was thought to extend 5100 miles, or 90+o~ -- more than
twice its real length.  This sea, however, has well known and
was
charted with considerable accuracy at a time when general maps
were still quite fantastic.  The extreme north and the extreme
south of the Hemisphere of Land were inhabited respectively by
the Scythians and the Garamantes.  The great ocean surrounding
the land was an object of terror, full of mysterious dangers
--
monsters, rocks, whirlpools, chasms.  In the exact centre of
the
land, midway between Gibraltar and Ganges, is Jerusalem. 
'Thus
saith the Lord God; this is Jerusalem: I have set it in the
midst
of the nations and countries that are round about her'
(Ezekiel
v, 5).  Half-way between Gibraltar and Jerusalem, in the
middle
of the western world, is Rome.  Somewhere on the globe is the
Garden of Eden, where Enoch and Elijah still abide in the
flesh,
awaiting the Day of Judgment.  Although it was reached by
sundry ancient travelers, opinions were diverse concerning its
exact whereabouts.  Generally it was placed in Asia.  The
English
Bible says (Gen. ii, 8): 'And the Lord planted a garden
eastward
in Eden.'  But in the usual text of the Vulgate the 'eastward'
does not appear.  Some located it on the summit of a lofty
mountain,
some on an island, especially the island of Ceylon.  Bede and
Peter Lombard record a belief that it projected upward to the
sphere of the moon, and thus escaped the flood; but St. Thomas
(^Summa Theologiae~ Prima, Qu. cii, Art. I) does not accept
this
estimate of prodigious height as literal fact.  Whether there
was
land on the watery side of the earth was a question hotly
debated;
the doctrine of the antipodes -- that is, of a race of men
separated
by an impassable ocean from Adam and from Christ -- was
denied by St. Augustine and condemned by the Church.  Dante
chose for his Eden, the scene of man's fall, a point directly
opposite
Jerusalem, the scene of his redemption.  Dante's love of
symmetry shows itself in the construction of his poem and of
his
universe: a high mountain balances a deep Hell; an
Antipurgatorio
balances an Antinferno; the Valley of the Princes, on the
mountain, balances the Nobile Castello of the lower world. 
His
Earthly Paradise is situated on the top of a huge mountain
which
rises on a solitary island in the midst of the Hemisphere of
Water. 
There is no reason to believe that he regarded it as
enormously
higher than a real mountain might be.
     The upper part of the conical mountain-side is occupied
by the
seven terraces of Purgatory, where repentant souls come after
death to cleanse themselves for Heaven.  After leaving the
body
they are brought to the island in a boat guided by an angel. 
Dante apparently agrees with St. Ambrose in holding that all
human spirits destined to be saved (except Christ and Mary)
must pass through Purgatory; on this point St. Thomas seems to
be of different mind.  Furthermore, according to Dante's
belief,
no souls ever went to Purgatory until the redemption was
accomplished;
before the Crucifixion, unrepentant souls went to Hell,
as they still do, while penitent souls descended to the Limbus
to
await the Saviour's coming.  The lower part of the mountain
slope, on Dante's island, is a place of waiting for Christians
who
postponed repentance until the very end of life.  There we
find
those who were over-absorbed by cares of state, those whose
career was prematurely ended by a violent death, those whom
indolence retarded.  On the shore, slowly circling around the
mountain, are the excommunicated who died repentant though
still under the anathema of the Church.  All of these are
excluded
for a time from the penance they are eager to begin.  Dante
and
Virgil emerge on the east side of the edge of the island, on
the
morning of Easter Sunday.  There they meet the guardian of the
realm, Cato, the personification of Free Will.  They
laboriously
ascend the cliffs, still on the eastern side, towards the gate
of
Purgatory.  Over a considerable part of the way, however,
Dante
is mysteriously carried in his sleep by Lucia.  We therefore
do not
know how high up on the mountain the entrance to Purgatory
really is; but we may naturally infer that it is more than
half-way,
since all of Purgatory proper is above the region of
atmospheric change.  
At the gate is an angelic keeper, the representative of
Ecclesiastical
Authority.  Steps cut into the steep rock
lead from one terrace of Purgatory to another; on each terrace
Dante and his guide turn to the right and proceed for some
distance
around the northern side of the cone, so that on leaving the
last shelf they are on the west side, having made half the
circuit. 
They reach the Garden of Eden, which covers the circular
mountain-top, on Wednesday morning.  Here the presiding
genius, the
embodiment of Innocence, is a lovely maiden, Matilda.  On
Wednesday noon they rise to Heaven.  It will be seen that
three nights
are spent on the island; they are passed by Dante in rest and
sleep, night being the time for meditation as day is the time
for
activity.  In the course of each night he has a symbolic
dream.
     Led by one of his happiest inspirations, the poet has
placed the
action of this ^cantica~ in the open air, not in the gloomy
cavern of
tradition.  As the theme of the ^Purgatorio~ is betterment,
release
from sin and preparation for Heaven, its atmosphere is rightly
one
of hope and progress, and for that reason it appeals
peculiarly to
the modern mind.  There are two elements in sin: the turning
away from God and the turning toward temporal good.  The first
naturally; ceases with repentance, and is forgiven.  The
second is
due to vices, or faults of character, which must be cured. 
According
to established Christian doctrine, of these fundamental
defects
there are seven, known as the 'capital vices': pride, envy,
anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony, lust.  Dante, in harmony with
St. Gregory and St. Bonaventure, arranges them in this order. 
There was, however, among Church writers, no absolute
agreement
as to their sequence, although pride was always regarded as
the worst.  St. Thomas, in various passages, arranges them in
four
somewhat different ways, and apparently regards the order as
unimportant; once he has them as they appear in the
^Commedia.~ 
At the beginning of the ^Inferno~ we see Dante, moved by
grace,
turning back to God.  He is already repentant.  On quitting
Hell,
he puts sin behind him and tears himself away from evil
practices;
but there still remains the positive task of regeneration. 
The
whole ascent of the mountain signifies this reformatory
effort,
an undoing of the work of sin, -- the passage through the
seven
circles of Purgatory representing specifically the
accomplishment
of penance under ecclesiastical direction.  The torment on
each
terrace is a symbol of the particular form of discipline
needed to
remove from the spirit one of the seven capital vices.  When
the
soul is entirely cleansed, it regains the perfect freedom of
will that
sin has restricted; it finds itself once more in the state of
original
innocence which man enjoyed before the fall.  The recovery of
innocence is symbolized by the entrance into the Garden of
Eden. 
Then comes the sacrament of penance, ending with absolution,
after which the soul is ready to see Heaven.
     Every sin consists in an act of the will, and is judged
according
to its motive, not according to its effect.  The will is
fundamentally
a 'craving for good,' which produces evil incidentally in the
attempt to acquire good that is not real but apparent.  The
guilty
act is therefore a yielding to the desire for this apparent or
unreal good.  But although sin is not in the first place
perpetrated
for the sake of evil, indulgence in it creates a 'habit' that
begets
'malice,' the love of evil for itself.  All sins fall, then,
into two
classes, those of passion and those of malice.  The seven
capital
vices are all due to passion, and from them all sins of
passion
derive, whether they be sins of desire or sins of
irascibility; a capital
vice may, in fact, bring about a sin quite different from
itself, but
the act is classified in accordance with its source.  Sins of
malice
are not due directly to passion, but to a habit caused, as we
have
seen, by repeated yielding to guilty impulse.  All deliberate
and
'habitual' sins may be called 'malicious.'  Inasmuch as the
sinner's guilt is proportionate to his understanding, the
blindly
impetuous or ignorant sinner is less culpable than the
malicious
sinner, who consciously prefers temporal to spiritual good. 
The
capital vices are responsible for sins of weakness; offences
against
justice, on the other hand, are all due to malice.  In
Purgatory
there can be no malicious souls, because a soul in a state of
malice
cannot repent, and only the repentant reach Purgatory; the
moment a malicious sinner repents, his sin ceases to be one of
malice, and must be attributed to the capital vice that first
produced it.  Furthermore, heresy (or ^infidelitas)~ is
unknown in
Purgatory; for, to admit of repentance, unbelief must give way
to faith, and then there is left only the vice (presumably
pride)
that led to infidelity.  It is evident, then, that in a
portrayal of
Purgatory malice and heresy, as such, may be left out of
account,
and only the seven capital vices need be directly considered.
     As Hell is a place of punishment for the unrepentant and
Purgatory a place of reformation for the penitent, it is
comprehensible 
that Dante should look at sin in these two regions from
different standpoints.  In Hell malice and heresy are at home. 
Furthermore, the conception of Hell is universal, while the
idea
of Purgatory is peculiarly Christian.  In ^Monarchia~, III,
xvi,
43 ff., Dante describes the two goals of human endeavor,
temporal
and eternal happiness; the first we reach through
'philosophical,'
the second through 'spiritual teaching.'  Following a similar
distinction, Dante treats wickedness in the ^Purgatorio~ from
the
theological, in the ^Inferno~ from the philosophical or moral
side. 
Only in the offences against faith do we find in Dante's lower
world (where Christ is never named) a distinctively Christian
element; and even in the circle of heresy Epicurus is chosen
as the
leading example, as is Capaneus, another heathen, in the realm
of
blasphemy.  The whole system is Aristotelian, and its fitting
expounder is the ancient Virgil.  Of the seven capital vices
of
Christian theology, four, to be sure, are included in the plan
of
the ^Inferno~ -- lust, gluttony, avarice, and anger; but these
four
were familiar to the moral philosophers of antiquity.  Sloth,
on the
other hand, was unknown to Aristotle, and envy was to him not
a
vice, but a culpable passion; it is natural, then, that these
forms
of evil should have no specific place in Dante's Hell.  As to
pride
Aristotle (with whom Cicero in the main agrees) does discuss
it,
under the name of 'vainglory,' as an excess of 'magnanimity';
an
appropriate enough place for it, according to his description,
would seem to be somewhere between Incontinence and Malice
and Dante does, in fact, there illustrate, in the person of
Farinata,
pride as a cause of heresy.  St. Thomas more than once regards
^superbia~ in this light.  It will be remembered that Dante's
Hell falls
into two great parts, an upper and a lower.  The sins in the
upper
section are directed against temperance, those in the lower
against
justice.  All the evil in the first may be attributed to
infirmity; all
in the second, to malice.  But malice itself, in the
^Commedia~, is of
two distinct kinds.  The sins in Dante's Hell are classified,
not
simply under two heads ('upper' and 'lower'), but, in partial
accordance with Aristotle's terminology, under the three heads
of
Incontinence, Bestiality, and Malice.  The last two, which
belong
to the Lower Hell, correspond more nearly, however, to St.
Thomas's
'bestial malice' and 'human malice.'  Cicero's 'violence'
and 'fraud' are cited by the poet apparently as equivalents.
Fraud is 'de l' uom proprio male,' that is, ^malitia humana.~ 
But
St. Thomas, like almost all other moralists, considers ^vis~
as worse
than ^fraus;~ Aristotle, who also distinguishes violence and
fraud,
does not commit himself as to their relative iniquity.  Dante,
combining the Ciceronian and Aristotelian ^vis~ with St.
Thomas's
^bestialis malitia~, makes of Bestiality a third distinct
state of the
will, different both from Incontinence (or ^infirmitas)~ and
from
Malice (or ^militia humana~), more culpable than the first and
less
so than the second.  Their order follows, it would seem, the
Gregorian maxim, 'The greater the infamy, the less the guilt.' 
In
this arrangement Dante stands really alone.  On the other
hand,
while St. Thomas regards the bestial sins as offences against
temperance, Dante considers them as offences against justice,
and therefore worthy of the Lower Hell.  The only two phases
of
bestial wrong-doing that are discussed at any length by St.
Thomas
-- ferocity and sodomy -- are illustrated in the first and
third
^gironi~ of Dante's seventh circle.
     The ^Purgatorio~, full of tender reminiscence, has an
idyliic tone
that is lacking in the other two ^cantiche.~  When was it
written? 
E. G. Parodi, ^Poesia e storia nella Divina Commedia~, 367
ff., would
put it between 1308 and 1312 (or the begining of 1313) -- that
is,
before the death of the Emperor Henry VII.  Parodi's
contention
is that when Dante wrote the ^Inferno~, the ^Convivio~, the
^De Vulgari
Eloquentia~, he had not yet evolved the idea of the conflict
between
Empire and Papacy, and the usurpation of power by the latter
as
the cause of the wickedness of the world; this idea developed
with
the enterprise of Henry, and made Dante a Ghibelline.  In the
^Purgatorio~ the spirit of Henry dominates; the prophecies are
in the
same vein as Dante's political letters.  The notable one in
Canto
XXXIII is interpreted as expressing confidence in the
impending
triumph of Henry.  This interesting and ably argued thesis
meets
with some obstacles in the shape of specific dates.
