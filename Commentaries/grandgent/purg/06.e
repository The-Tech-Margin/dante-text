	|Proemio.~ THE leading personage of this canto is that 'Lombard
soul' who
so fired the imagination of two great poets.  Browning saw in
Sordello the representative of a changing age, an infinitely
varied
and interesting civilization; in Dante's eyes he was the
critic of
corrupt and incompetent government.  The real Sordello was one
of those roving Italians who, in the 13th century, helped to
"maintain the waning glory of Proven$cal verse, and profited
by its
immense vogue in foreign countries.  Born in the Mantuan town
of
Goito, he lived the restless and sometimes scandalous life of
a
handsome adventurer and clever poet at various courts in
Lombardy
and Piedmont, then in France and Spain, and found at last
a mighty protector in the Count of Provence.  Passing into the
service of the count's son-in-law, Charles of Anjou, he
probably
saw the Sicilian campaign and the battle of Benevento.  By
this
time he was certainly a man of considerable importance. 
Charles,
after a reproof from Pope Clement IV for his neglect of the
poet,
bestowed upon him some castles in the Abruzzi.  Sordello had
evidently risen to knighthood, and we may assume that the
notoriety of his youthful career was overshadowed by the fame
of his later years.  Dante, in ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, I, xv,
9-14,
describes him as a man of great eloquence who had renounced
his
native dialect not only in poetry but in speech.  His lyric
work,
as we possess it, does not rise above mediocrity; but his
^Ensenhamen
d'Onor~, a long didactic poem, though not brilliant in style,
contains much that surely appealed to Dante -- a high standard
of chivalrous conduct and a vigorous invective against the
mean-spirited
rich.  Dante's conception of him, however, was obviously
based, in the main, upon a single short piece of verse, a
lament
over the death of Blacatz, a Proven$cal patron of letters;
Sordello
compares the virtues of the departed with the vices and
weaknesses of those that are left, and turns his elegy into
scathing
satire, fearless and merciless condemnation of the potentates
of
his time, from the Emperor down.  Dante regards him, then, as
the type of the unflinching patriot and reformer, the scourge
of
kings.  He invests his figure with more than regal dignity. 
It is
likely that he knew but little of the real Sordello.  He puts
into the
figure much of himself, as he did with Statius.  Though a
member
of the fourth class of the 'negligent' (those whose minds were
over-engrossed
by public cares), Sordello sits 'all alone,' apart from the
monarchs whom he judged.  The instant kindling of the flame of
love by the mere mention of his native Mantua, -- contrasted
as it
is with the majestic indifference of his first attitude, and
rendered
the more effective by the amazing swiftness of the action, --
leads
up naturally to the apostrophe to Italy which concludes the
canto,
a denunciation that vents all the pent-up bitterness of the
exile's
heart.  Its savage irony recalls the poem and the letter
addressed
by Guittone d'Arezzo to the Florentines on the morrow of their
great defeat at Montaperti.  For many centuries it bore a
stern
message to Italians.

	|1.~  `Hazard,' a game played with three dice, was very much
in vogue, in spite of prohibitions. 

	|3.  Volte~, `throws.' 

	|13.~  The `Aretine' is Benincasa of Laterina in the county
of Arezzo, a jurist, who visited Florence in 1282; he was
murdered in Rome, while sitting in court, by the famous robber,
Ghino di Tacco (Boccaccio, ^Decamerone~, X, 2), whose brother he
had condemned to death. 

	|15.~  `The other' Aretine is said to be Guccio Tarlati of
Pietramala, who was drowned in the Arno while `hunting' the
enemy, or, possibly, `hunted by': ^Stud. dant.~, I, 143. 

	|17.~  `Frederick, junior,' the son of Count Guido Novello
and a daughter of Frederick II, was killed in war in the
Casentino in 1291. -- |Quel da Pisa~ is apparently Giovanni or
Gano, called Farinata, the son of the Marzucco of l. 18. 

	|18.~  Marzucco was a Pisan, prominent in public affairs,
who in 1287 left the world and became a Franciscan friar.
According to the most plausible of the conflicting early
explanations, his fortitude was shown by pardoning the murderer
of his son.  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 123.  A certain Marzuchus
Scornigianus was `syndicus' of Pisa in 1275; he is recorded also
in Arezzo, Florence, Venice (1275): ^Bull.~, XX, 60.  Dante may
have known Marzucco between 1291 and 1295, when the latter was
very old, at the monastery of Santa Croce. 

	|19.~  Count Orso of Mangona was murdered, it is said, by
his cousin Albert.  The fathers of Orso and Albert killed each
other: cf. ^Inf.~ XXXII, 55-8. 

	|20.  Inveggia~ = ^invidia.~ 

	|22.~  Pierre de la Brosse of Turenne, -- `the soul parted
from its body by hate and envy,' -- was chamberlain of Louis IX
and Philip III of France.  Through the wiles of Philip's second
wife, Mary of Brabant, whom Pierre had accused of the murder of
the heir to the throne, he was hanged in 1278. -- |Provveggia~ =
^provveda~, `let her look to it,' while she is alive, that she be
not consigned, after death, to the `worse flock' of the damned. 
Mary lived until 1321. 

	|26.  Che pregar pur ch' altri preghi~, `who prayed only
that one pray' for them. 

	|27.  Avacci~: cf. IV, 116. 

	|29.~  When the shade of the unburied Palinurus begs Aeneas
to take him over the Styx, the Sibyl replies (^Aen.~, VI, 373-6):

     `Unde haec, o Palinure, tibi tam dira cupido?
     Tu Stygias inhumatus aquas amnemque severum 
     Eumenidum aspicies? ripamve injussus adibis?   
     Desine fata Deum flecti sperare precando.' 

	|33.~  Dante questions his own understanding, not Virgil's
statement. 

	|37.~  `The summit of justice (^apex juris~) is not
overturned.'  Cf. Shakspere, ^Measure for Measure~, II, ii, 75-
77:

     `How would you be
     If He who is the ^top of judgment~ should
     But judge you as you are?' 

	|38.  Perch@e~, `though.' -- |In un punto~, `in a single
moment.' 

	|39.  De'~ = ^deve.~ -- |Si stalla~, `is stationed.' --
Satisfaction, an atonement for the injury done, can be made by
other loving hearts as well as by the guilty one.  See the last
paragraph of the Argument to Canto III. 

	|42.~  Palinurus was a pagan, not `living in grace' (IV,
134), and his prayer was not addressed to God nor received by
him. 

	|43.  Veramente~, `nevertheless': cf. II, 98. -- |Alto
sospetto~, `deep doubt.'  A question involving the doctrine of
grace transcends the power of reason, and is not to be `settled'
without revelation. 

	|46.~  This mention of the name -- the first since the
beginning of the journey -- makes Dante more eager to climb. 

	|51.~  Cf. ^Eclogue~ I, 84: `Majoresque cadunt altis de
montibus umbrae.' 

	|54.  Stanzi~, `thinkest': cf. Inf. XXV, 10. 

	|57.~  In the middle of the afternoon the whole eastern side
of the mountain is in the shade, and Dante no longer casts a
shadow. 

	|66.~  Cf. Gen xlix, 9: `he couched as a lion.' 

	|72.  Romita~, `absorbed.' 

	|75.~  See the second paragraph of the Argument to Canto II.

	|76.  Ostello~: cf. ^V. N.~, Sonnet II, 23. 

	|77.  Nocchiere~: cf. ^Conv.~, IV, iv, 50-72. 

	|78.~  Several old writers call Italy `domina provinciarum';
cf. Lamentations of Jeremiah i, 1, `princess among the provinces
(^princeps provinciarum).~'  Guittone d'Arezzo, in an epistle to
Florence, after the battle of Montaperti, says: `che devenuta se'
non gi@a reina, ma ancilla conculcata e sottoposta a tributo.' 
Cf. Isaiah 1, 21: `How is the faithful city become a harlot!' 

	|88.~  In ll. 88-102 Italy is pictured as a horse. Justinian
(^Par.~ VI) `adjusted its bridle' by codifying the laws, but
there is no Emperor to fill the saddle. 

	|91.  Gente~: the clergy. 

	|93.~  Mat. xxii, 21: `Render therefore unto Caesar the
things which are Caesar's.' 

	|96.  Predella~, `rein': ever since the clergy usurped
temporal authority. 

	|97.~  Albert of Hapsburg was elected King of the Romans in
1298, but never went to Italy to be crowned. 

	|100.~  In 1307 Albert's oldest son died after a short
sickness; the next year Albert himself was murdered by his
nephew, John the Parricide.  If Dante was apostrophizing Albert
as still alive at the time of writing, this canto must have been
composed between these two events.  If, on the other hand, the
poet was putting himself back into the year 1300, the `judgment'
would naturally be the assassination of Albert, and the
`successor' would be the next Emperor, Henry VII, who descended
into Italy.  According to Parodi, the passage was probably
written shortly after the events of 1307 and 1308, presumably
late in 1309 or early in 1310. 

	|103.  Il padre~: Rudolph, who was as remiss as his son. 

	|104.~  `Held by greed of things up yonder': the desire to
increase their German states. 

	|106-107.~  Dante cites a few of the great houses that were
ravaged by strife: the Montecchi of Verona, Ghibellines; the
Cappelletti of Cremona, of the Church party; the Monaldi and
Filippeschi, rival families (Guelf and Ghibelline) of Perugia and
Orvieto.  There is no evidence that the `Capulets' were ever
neighbors of the `Montagues' in Verona: cf. ^Bull.~, XII, 240.
The story of Romeo and Juliet comes from Bandello, who took it
from Luigi da Porto, who got it from Masuccio da Salerno (1476).
It has been suggested that the legend of the rival families in
Verona is due originally to a misinterpretation of Dante's words.
See Olin H. Moore in ^Speculum~, June, 1930. 

	|108.  Con sospetti~, `apprehensive.' 

	|109.  Pressura~: cf. Luke xxi, 25, `pressura gentium,'
`distress of nations.' 

	|111.~  The Counts of Santafiora, a great Ghibelline family,
lost, at the close of the 13th century, a great part of their
territory to Siena.  Santa Fiora is in the Maremma. 

	|114.  Accompagne~ = ^accompagni.~ 

	|123.  Scisso~, `severed': inaccessible to our
understanding. 

	|125.~  C. Claudius Marcellus (`Marcellus...loquax,' as
Julius Caesar calls him in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, I, 313) was a
strenuous opponent of Caesar and a partisan of Pompey.  E. G.
Gardner, in the ^Modern Language Review~, IX, 104, suggests that
the person in question is Virgil's Marcellus of ^Aen.~, VI, 883:
`Tu Marcellus eris,' spoken ironically. 

	|129.  Si argomenta~, `strives,' does its best.  Ll. 127-44
are bitterly ironical. 

	|130.  Tardi scocca~, `it is slow in shooting'; it does not
quickly find expression. 

	|131.  Per non venir~, `because it does not come.' 

	|135.  Sanza chiamare~, `without being called.' -- |I' mi
sobbarco~, `I bend my back' for the `common burden' of public
service. 

	|136.  Onde~, `wherefore': thou hast good reason. 

	|138.  L'effetto nol~ (= ^non lo~) |nasconde~, `the result
shows.' 

	|139.  Fenno~ = ^fecero.~ 

	|141.~  Athens and Lacedaemon `ofered but a slight
suggestion of right living,' compared to Florence. 

	|142.  Sottili~, `delicate.'  Dante plays upon the double
sense of ^sottile~, which means `shrewd' and `flimsy.'  The
fabric of laws which Florence spins in October does not last
until mid-November.  The two months were perhaps suggested by the
vicissitudes of 1301, in which year the White priors who took
office on Oct. 18 were deposed by the Blacks on Nov. 8. 

	|145.  Rimembre~ = ^rimembri~: cf. l. 114. 

	|147.  Membre~ = ^membra~, pl. 

	|151.~  `But fights her pain by tossing.'  Cf. St.
Augustine, ^Confessiones~, VI, xvi, 3: `Versa et reversa in
tergum et in latera et in ventrem, et dura sunt omnia.'
