	|4.  Riva~: the outer edge of the mountain-top. 

	|6.  Auliva~, `was fragrant.' 

	|12.~  U' = ^ove.~  The direction in which the mountain
casts its shadow in the morning is, of course, the west. 

	|13.~  `But, for all that, not so deflected from their 
upright state'... 

	|15.  Lasciasser~, `should forbear.' 

	|16.  Ore~: most editors print ^#ore~, `winds'; but if the
movement of the air is eternal and unchanging (ll. 7-8, 103-8),
there can be no `first breezes.'  The birds greet with song the
morning `hours.' 

	|17.  Ricevieno~ = ^ricevevano~, `greeted.' 

	|20.~  The pine grove of Classe, or Chiassi, -- the old port
of Ravenna, from which the Adriatic has now receded, -- was
exposed to the ^Scirocco~, or southeast wind. -- Cf. ^Met.~, XV,
603-4. -- For the old form, ^Chiassi~, cf. ^Creti~: the ending 
-^i~ was commoner then than it is now. 

	|21.  Aeolus~, king of the winds: ^Aen.~, I, 52-7. 

	|26.~  Dante, who reached the Garden of Eden on its west
side, is walking east.  As the stream which `prevents him from 
going further' flows towards his left, it must, at this point, be
running north. 

	|29.  Parrieno~ = ^parrebbero.~ 

	|30.  Verso di~, `compared with.' 

	|33.~  Ps. cxxi (Vulg. cxx), 6: `The sum shall not smite 
thee by day, nor the moon by night.'  Cf. ^Met.~, V, 388-9. 

	|36.  Mai~ (plural of ^maio~), `May-branches,' i.e, spring
foliage.  In some parts of Italy a branch, called ^maio~ or
^maggio~, is used in the celebration of May Day, serving the 
purpose either of May-pole or of May-basket. 

	|37.  Elli~, `there.' 

	|40.  Gia~: imperfect of ^gire.~ 

	|45.~  The `features' in question are particularly the eyes.

	|46.  Vegnati in voglia~, `may it be thy pleasure.' 

	|48.  Intender che~, `understand what.' 

	|50.~  When Proserpine, the daughter of Ceres, was suddenly
carried off to the lower world by Pluto, she had been picking
flowers in the `perpetual springtime' of the valley of Henna: cf.
^Met.~, V, 385-408, especially 391. 

	|52.  Piante~, `feet.' -- |Strette~, `close.' 

	|60.  Intendimenti~, `meaning.' 

	|66.~  It was contrary to the custom of Cupid to wound 
unintentionaliy, as he did when, coming to kiss his mother, he 
pricked her with an arrow projecting from his quiver, and caused
her to love Adonis: ^Met.~, X, 525-32. 

	|68.  Trattando~, `carrying' or `trailing.'  The `many
colors' are varied flowers. 

	|70.~  The `three steps' may signify simply a very short 
distance which separates Dante from that which he is eager to 
reach: cf. VIII, 46.  If the words have an allegorical meaning, 
they probably refer to the three stages of the sacrament of 
penance through which Dante must pass to attain perfect happiness
on earth: cf. XXXI, 1-90. 

	|71.~  Xerxes, king of Persia, crossed the Hellespont with a
vast army to conquer Greece, but was defeated and forced to flee
ignominiously.  Cf. ^Phars.~ II, 672-5: 

     `Tales fama canit tumidum super aequora Xerxen 
     Construxisse vias, multum cum pontibus ausus, 
     Europamque Asiae, Sestonque admovit Abydo, 
     Incessitque fretum rapidi super Hellesponti.' 

Paulus Orosius, ^Historia adversus Paganos~, II, x, moralizes
over his humiliation.  Cf. Valerius Maximus, ^Facta et Dicta 
Memorabilia~, IX, v, Ext. 2. 

	|74.~  The Hellespont `swelled' between Leander in Abydos
and his beloved Hero in Sestos: Ovid, Epistulae XVII and XVIII. 

	|75.  Quel~: the ^fiume~ of l. 70. 

	|80.~  Ps. xcii (Vulg. xci), 4: `For thou, Lord, ^hast made
me glad~ through thy work.'  The psalm proclaims the works of the
Lord, the downfall of the wicked and the final triumph of the
righteous. 

	|82.~  Dante, who was third in the circles of gluttony and
lust (XXII, 127-8; XXVI, 16-7), and second in traversing the fire
(XXVII, 46-7), is now first. 

	|87.~  The statement of Statius in XXI, 43-54, seems to be
contradicted by the presence of water and wind at the top of the
mountain. 

	|91.~  As God alone is perfect, he can be altogether
satisfied only with himself. 

	|94.  Per sua diffalta~, `by his own shortcoming,' not
because of any imperfection in the place. 

	|97.  Perch$e~, `in order that.' -- |Turbar~ is the subject
of ^facesse~ in l. 100. -- |Che~ is the object of |fanno.~ 

	|102.~  `And it is free from them, from that point on where
it is locked,' i.e., above the gate: cf. XXI, 48. 

	|104.~  The air that envelops the earth is surrounded by a
layer of fire, which in turn is enclosed in the heaven of the 
moon.  As there are no intervals of empty space between these 
spheres, the two mobile elements -- air and fire -- are swept 
around the earth by the heavens in their `primal revolution,' or
daily circuit.  Dante can hardly have estimated the velocity of 
such a motion of the atmosphere; or, if he did, he must have 
assumed a considerable drag or retardation. 

	|105.~  `If its course is not broken in some quarter.'  On
the rugged surface of the earth the daily revolution of the air
encounters so many obstacles that it is not felt; but this
mountain-top, rising so high that it is `quite free in the quick
air,' receives the atmospheric current unobstructed. 

	|109.  Tanto puote~, `has such force.' 

	|111.~  The air, in its revolution around the earth,
scatters far and wide the vital power of the plant. 

	|114.  Di~, `from' -- This explanation of the diversity of
vegetation in each climate has not been found in any other
author.  It seems almost to provide an explanation of the 
phenomenon called `mutation.' 

	|117.  Vi s'appiglia~, `takes root there.' 

	|120.  Di l@a non si schianta~, `is not plucked in your
world.'  The Garden of Eden contains all the flora of the rest of
the world, and some besides. 

	|121.  Vena~, `spring': cf. Canzone XV, 53.  The water of
this stream comes from a miraculous fount, not from any natural 
spring fed by condensed aqueous vapor. 

	|131.  Adopra~, `works.'  To be operative, the water must be
tasted in both streams. 

	|138.  Promission,~ `my promise.' -- |Si spazia,~ `extends.' 

	|140.~  The golden age was `poetized' by Ovid, ^Met.~, I,
89-112.  The ancient poets were gifted with sight beyond that of
their contemporaries (cf. the `nobile castello' in ^Inf.~ IV), 
and had some inkling of the truth.  When they sang of Parnassus 
and the golden age, they may have been dimly conscious of the 
real origin of man. 

	|144.~  `This (stream) is the nectar of which they all
sing.' 

	|147.  Costrutto~, `passage,' words.
