	|4.~  Mat. v, 6: `Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness' -- in the Vulgate, `Beati qui 
esuriunt et sitiunt ^justitiam.~'  Dante here takes `justice' in 
the special sense of moderation, the golden mean between avarice
and prodigality, the virtue opposed to both these sins. 

	|5.  Voci~, `words.' 

	|6.~  The verse as recited by the angel is: `Beati qui 
sitiunt justitiam,' the ^esuriunt~ (`hunger') being left out.  In
the circle of gluttony the same verse is given, in a different 
sense, the ^esuriunt~ being retained and the ^sitiunt~ (`thirst')
omitted.  To get the requisite number of appropriate beatitudes,
Dante used this one twice, and in both cases somewhat distorted 
its form and meaning. 

	|10-11.~  Virgil here says of spiritual love what Francesca
said of carnal passion in ^Inf.~ V, 103. 

	|14.~  The Latin poet Juvenal was a contemporary of Statius,
whom he praised in his ^Satires~, VII, 81-7.  Dante mentions him
twice in ^Conv.~ and once in ^Mon.~ 

	|16-17.  Quale pi@u strinse mai~, `the greatest that ever
bound (one).' 

	|20.  Sicurt@a~, `confidence.' 

	|21.  Ragiona~, `speak.' 

	|24.  Cura~, `zeal.' 

	|28.  Veramente~, `to be sure.' 

	|29.  Matera~ = ^materia~ (cf. XVIII, 37; also ^Lavina~ in
XVII, 37), `ground.' 

	|30.~  `Because the real cause is hidden.' 

	|31.  Avvera~, `assures.' 

	|33.  Per~, `because of.' 

	|36.~  `Thousands of months': over 500 years (XXI, 68), or
more than 6000 months. 

	|37.  Drizzai~, `set right.' 

	|38.  Intesi~, `understood,' penetrated the hidden meaning. 
Cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 51; ^Inf.~ XXIV, 74; ^Par.~ XIV, 126; and
especially ^Purg.~ XIX, 137, where we find exactly the same 
use.

	|40-41.~  Aen., III, 56-7: 

     `Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, 
     Auri sacra fames?' 

These words evidently mean: `To what dost thou not drive mortal 
hearts, accursed hunger for gold?'  But Dante saw in them also, 
taking them apart from their context, the concealed moral 
significance which he here puts into the mouth of Statius: `Why,
O blessed (i.e., temperate) hunger for gold, dost thou not govern
mortal appetite,' keeping it equally distant from avarice and 
prodigality?  The discovery of this inner meaning in his master's
verses was the beginning of Statius's reformation. -- For the use
of |reggi~, cf. Boethius, ^Cons.~, II, Met. viii, 28-30 (cited in
^Mon.~, I, ix, end): 

     `O felix hominum genus 
     Si vestros animos amor, 
     Quo caelum regitur, regat!' 

	|42.~  `Rolling (a heavy weight), I should (now) be engaged
in the dismal tilts' of the misers and the prodigals in Hell: cf.
^Inf.~ VII, 25-30. 

	|46.~  The `cropped hair' is a symbol of prodigality: ^Inf.~
VII, 56-7. 

	|47.  Che~, `which,' subject of ^toglie~ in l. 48.  Many 
are lost because they do not understand that prodigality is a 
sin, as well as avarice.  Their ignorance, which `robs them of
repentance,' is not a sufficient excuse, because it is not
insuperable or `invincible' ignorance: they had a chance to learn
better.  Cf. St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu.
lxxvi, Art. 2. 

	|48.  Ne li stremi~ is a translation of the Latin ^in 
extremis.~ 

	|49.  Rimbecca~, `rebuts.' 

	|56.~  By the `twofold affliction of Jocasta' is meant her
two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, whose strife and death are
related in the 11th book of the ^Thebaid.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI,
52-4.  

	|57.~  This mention of the ^Bucolics~, or ^Eclogues~, of
Virgil prepares the reader for the quotation from the 4th Eclogue
in ll. 70-2. 

	|58.~  `Judging from that (i.e., the music) which Clio 
plays with thee there': judging from the narrative which the 
pagan muse inspired.  Clio, the muse of history, is invoked twice
in the ^Thebaid~ and once (as `goddess') in the ^Achilleid.~ -- 
For the accentuation ^Cli@o~, cf. ^Calliop@e~ in I, 9. 

	|61.~  What heavenly or earthly light `scattered thy 
darkness'? 

	|63.~  The `fisherman' is St. Peter.  In the ^Thebaid~, XII,
209, Statius speaks of his work as a voyage. 

	|65.~  Parnassus is the mountain sacred to Apollo and the 
muses. 

	|66.  Appresso~, `next to,' `after.' 

	|68.~  Cf. St. Augustine, ^Confessions~, IV, xvi.  For some
other uses of this simile, see ^Tor.~, 517. 

	|74.  Veggi~ = ^vegga~ = ^veda~: cf. XIII, 112. -- |Mei~ =
^meglio.~ 

	|79.  Toccata~, `mentioned.' 

	|83.~  Domitian was Emperor toward the close of the first 
century of our era. 

	|85.~  `As long as I remained yonder.'  For the passive 
impersonal construction, cf. XVI, 118-9.  |Stette~ is to be 
connected with the name ^Statius~, from ^sto, stare~, `to dally.' 

	|86.  Sovvenni~, `helped.' 

	|87.~  See, in the ^Thebaid~, XII, 481 ff., the description
of the altar to Clemency, refuge of the afflicted, open to all,
without ceremony or sacrifice.  It is to be noted that after the
Greeks reach the Asopus, Apollo and Diana are impotent to save
their favorites (^Thebaid~, IX, 653 ff.). 

	|88.~  The arrival of the Greeks at the rivers of Thebes 
marks the middle of the ^Thebaid.~  Cf. VII, 424-25: 

     `Jam ripas, Asope, tuas, Beotaque ventum 
     Flumina.' 

Statius, then, in Dante's belief, was baptized before the poem
was half done.  The river is a symbol of baptism, and the 
hesitation of the Greeks on the bank (`stat triste pecus,'
^Thebaid~, VII, 437) represents Statius's delay: cf. `per me si 
stette' in l. 85 

	|88-89.~  Before I told in verse the story of the campaign
of the Greeks against Thebes.  See ^Theb.~, VII, 424-25. In this
expedition, the Greeks were encouraged by Jove (a name which
Dante elsewhere applies to God) and opposed by the deities of
pagandom; the oracle at Delphi is silent. 

	|90.  Chiuso~, `secret.' -- |Fu'mi~ = ^mi fui~ = ^fui.~ 

	|93.~  Statius circled around the fourth circle (of sloth)
`over four centuries' before his penance of 500 years and more in
the circle of prodigality.  Cf. XXI, 67-8. 

	|96.  Soverchio~, `something left.' 

	|98.  Varo~ is probably for ^Vario~ (cf. ^matera~ in l. 29):
the Latin dramatist Lucius Varius.  Most texts have ^Varro~, but
this name would perhaps be inappropriate in connection with those
of the dramatic poets, Terence, Caecilius, Plautus.  Horace
mentions Caecilius, Plautus, and Terence together, in the same
order, in ^Epistulae~, II, i, 58-60.  On the other hand,
Plautus's comedies were commonly known as the `Fabulae 
Varronianae,' Varro having established the canon. 

	|100.~  Persius, the Latin satirist. 

	|101.~  Homer: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 88. 

	|103.~  The `first belt' is the Limbus. -- For |carcere 
cieco~, cf. ^Inf.~ X, 58-9, and ^Aen.~, VI, 734. 

	|105.~  `Our nurses' are the muses: cf. l. 102. 

	|106, 107.~  The Greek lyric poet, Simonides, is mentioned
with the Greek tragic poets, Euripides, Antiphon, and Agathon. 

	|109.~  By `thy people' Virgil means the characters in 
Statius's poems.  The first six enumerated are found in the 
^Thebaid~, the last two are found in the ^Achilleid.~ 

	|110-111.~  Antigone and Ismene were daughters of Oedipus
and Jocasta (l. 56); after fearful misfortunes, both were
condemned to death by Creon.  Deiphile and Argia were daughters
of Adrastus, king of Argos; the first was the wife of Tydeus
(^Inf.~ XXXII, 130), the second of Polynices (see note to l. 56);
Argia once possessed the `ill-fated ornament' of XII, 51.

	|112.~  It was Hypsipyle who pointed out the fountain of 
Langia to Adrastus and the other Greek kings, when their troops 
were dying of thirst (^Thebaid~, IV, 716 ff.): cf. ^Inf.~ XVIII,
92; ^Purg.~ XXVI, 95. 

	|113.~  Tiresias's daughter was Manto, whom Dante consigned
(^Inf.~ XX, 55), with the other soothsayers to the 4th ^bolgia~
of the 8th circle of Hell; for a discussion of this curious
inconsistency, see the Argument to Canto XX of the ^Inferno.~ --
Thetis the sea-goddess was the wife of Peleus and the mother of
Achilles: cf. IX, 37. 

	|114.~  Deidamia and `her sisters' were daughters of 
Lycomedes, king of Scyros with whom Thetis hid Achilles: IX, 34-
9.  Deidamia was loved by Achilles: ^Inf.~, XXVI, 62. 

	|118.~  The `handmaids of the day' are the hours of
daylight: cf. XII, 81. 

	|119.  Temo~ = ^timone~, `chariot-pole.'  The hours are here
represented as drawing in turn the car of day. 

	|120.~  The `blazing horn' is the bright tip of the pole, 
which now points `only upward,' as it is approaching the 
meridian. 

	|121.  Stremo~, `outer edge': cf. XIX, 81. 

	|126.~  The `worthy soul' who gives his silent assent is 
Statius. 

	|133.  Si digrada~, `tapers.' 

	|136.~  On the inner side, where the path was enclosed by
the cliff. 

	|141.  Caro~, `dearth.' 

	|143.~  The story of Mary at the wedding feast in Cana 
(John ii, 1-3), which she tried to make `honorable and perfect,'
was used in XIII, 29, as an example of loving solicitude; here it
appears among the noteworthy examples of temperance. 

	|144.~  `Than of her own mouth (i.e., of gratifying her own
appetite), which now answers (pleads) for you.' 

	|145.~  St. Thomas says that, according to Valerius Maximus,
the women, at the time of the early Romans, drank no wine: ^Summa
Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. cxlix, Art. 4. 

	|147.~  Daniel i, 8-17: `But Daniel purposed in his heart 
that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's 
(Nebuchadnezzar's) meat, nor with the wine which he drank...and 
Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.' 

	|148.~  The golden age is described in ^Met.~, I, 89-112. 

	|149.~  Cf. ^Cons.~, II, Metr. v, ll. 1-12. 

	|151.~  Mat. iii, 4: `his (John the Baptist's) meat was
locusts and wild honey.' 

	|154.  Aperto~, `revealed.' -- Mat. xi, 11: `Among them that
are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the
Baptist.'  Cf. Luke i, 15.
