	|1.  Alpe~, `mountains.' 

	|3.~  According to Aristotle and mediaeval authorities, 
the eye of the mole is covered by a membrane which prevents it 
from seeing. 

	|7.  Imagine~ means a mental picture, generally derived 
from visual impression.  ^Imaginativa~ (l. 13) and ^fantasia~ (l.
25) signify the faculty of receiving such pictures; 
^imaginazione~ is the power of composing them. 

	|10.~  Cf. XVI, 8-9. 

	|12.~  The `shores' of the Island of Purgatory. 

	|13.  Imaginativa~: see note to l. 7. -- |Ne rube~ = ^ci 
rubi~, `stealest us.' 

	|14.  Di fuor~, `from the outer world.' -- |Om~, `one': 
cf. French ^on.~ 

	|15.  Perch@e~, `although.'. 

	|16.  Non ti porge~, `offers thee naught.'  What is it 
that arouses the faculty of mental vision in the case of 
hallucinations, when no impression of sight comes from without? 
Is it some physical stellar influence, or the divine will 
operating through the stars?  Cf. St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~,
Prima, Qu. lxxxiv, Art. 6.  Is the poet really inspired by God? 

	|17.  S' informa~, `takes shape.' 

	|18.  Per s@e~: spontaneously. -- |Voler~: the `will' of 
God. -- |Scorge~, `directs.' 

	|19.~  The first example is that of Progne (or Procne), 
who, to avenge the cruel and infamous wrong done by her husband,
Tereus, king of Thrace, to her sister Philomela, made him eat of
the flesh of his own child, Itys.  Tereus and the two sisters 
were then turned into birds.  According to Aristotle (^Rhetoric~,
III, 3) and most of the Greeks, Progne became a nightingale and 
Philomela a swallow; the Latins, followed by modern poets, 
usually made Philomela the nightingale.  But Ovid (^Met.~, VI, 
424 ff.), the Latin poet from whom Dante got the story, does not
tell, and Virgil (^Eclogue~ VI, 79) seems to follow the Greek 
version, which Dante also adopted.  Cf. IX, 13-5.  See d' Ovidio,
579-81. --- |De l' empiezza~ depends on ^l' orma~, `the impress,'
in 1. 21. 

	|24.  Recetta~ = ^ricevuta.~ . 

	|26.~  The `one crucified' is Haman, minister of King 
Ahasuerus, who `reigned from India even unto Ethiopia' (Esther i,
1).  Enraged at the independence of the Jew, Mordecai, `so 
upright in word and deed' (l. 30), who `bowed not, nor did him 
reverence' (Esther iii, 5), `Haman sought to destroy all the Jews
that were throughout the whole kingdom' (v, 6); but through the 
infuence of Esther, Mordecai's cousin and adopted daughter, who 
had become the wife of Ahasuerus, he was himself `hanged on the 
gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai' (vii, 10).  In the 
Vulgate, the `gallows fifty cubits high' (vii, 9) is a `cross.' 
The scene of the execution is not described in the Bible. 

	|31.  Rompeo~ = ^ruppe.~ 

	|32.  Bulla~ = ^bolla~, `bubble': the air that is 
enclosed in a spherical film of water. 

	|35.~  The `queen' is Amata, wife of King Latinus, who 
hanged herself in a fit of rage on hearing a premature report of
the death of Turnus, the intended husband of her daughter Lavinia
(cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 126).  She feared that her daughter would be 
taken from her by the victorious Aeneas.  See ^Aen.~, VII, 
341 ff.; XII, 604 ff.  Cf. Dante, Epistola VII, vii, 148. 

	|37.~  Such forms as ^Lavina~ for ^Lavinia~ were common 
in early Italian.  Such forms as ^Tarquino, Babilona, domino, 
pecuna, Macedona~ occur even in the Latin of the time. 

	|39.~  Lavinia has to `mourn' the death of her mother 
before that of Turnus. 

	|40.  Ove di butto~ (cf. ^Inf.~ XXII, 130), `when 
suddenly.'  |Butto~ = ^botto.~ 

	|42.  Che guizza~, `which (i.e., sleep) quivers.' 

	|51.  Se non si raffronta~, `until it is face to face.' 
For the abrupt substitution (suggested by the rime) of the vivid
present tense for the imperfect, cf. XI, 75. -- Cf. Giacomo da
Lentini, ^Madonna dir vi voglio~, ll. 29-30: 

     `Che [lo cor] giamai non @e kito [= cheto] 
     Fintanto che non vene al suo sentore.' 

	|53.  Soverchio~, `excess.' 

	|55.  Ne la~ = ^nella~: for the imperfect rime, cf. 
^Inf.~ VIII, 17; ^Par.~ XI, 13.  Petrarch (and perhaps Dante) 
usually spelled such combinations with one ^l.~ Perhaps they were
often so pronounced.  Weak words in the rime are rare in Dante. 

	|58.  Sego~ = ^seco~ = ^con s@e.~  Cf. Mat. vii, 12. 

	|59.  Quale~, `whosoever.' -- |Uopo~, `need.' -- The 
logical order of the two clauses is inverted. 

	|60.  Nego~, `refusal.'  Cf. Canzone XII, 39: `E quei 
d'ogni merc@e par messo al niego.' 

	|63.  Poria~ = ^potrebbe.~ 

	|67.~  Cf. XII, 98.  It appears that the third letter is 
now removed from Dante's brow. 

	|68, 69.~  Mat. v, 9: `Blessed are the peacemakers.' 

	|73.  Virt@u~, `strength.' -- |Ti dilegue~, `meltest 
thou.' 

	|75.  Posta in triegue~, `suspended.' 

	|77.  Affissi~, `fixed.' 

	|83.  Semo~ = ^siamo.~ 

	|84.  Stea~ = ^stia.~ 

	|85, 86.~  `The love of right, diminished of its due 
(i.e., less than it should be), is here made good.'  The sin 
punished is ^acedia~, or sloth. 

	|87.  Si ribatte~, `is plied again.' 

	|93.  D' animo~, `of the will,' elective. 

	|97.  Nel primo ben diretto~, `turned to the primal 
goods,' i.e., heavenly blessings. 

	|98.~  `And while it is moderate in its attachment to 
secondary goods,' i.e., worldly blessings. 

	|99.  Mal diletto~, `sinful pleasure.' 

	|100, 101. O con pi@u cura~, etc.: when it runs to 
worldly good with more ardor, or to heavenly good with less 
ardor, than it should. 

	|102.  Adovra~, `is working': the subject is |sua 
fattura~, `his own creature.' 

	|106, 107.~  `Now, since love can never avert its gaze 
from the welfare of its own subject,' i.e., can never be hostile
to the interest of the person in whose heart it dwells. 

	|108.~  `Things are safe (i.e., exempt) from self-hate': 
we cannot hate ourselves.  Cf. Ephesians v, 29: `For no man ever
yet hated his own flesh.' 

	|109, 110.~  `And since no being can be conceived of as 
severed from the primal being and existing independently.'  Cf. 
Acts xvii, 28: `For in him [the Lord] we live, and move, and have
our being.' 

	|111.~  `Every product is debarred from hating him.'  It 
is impossible to hate God, in whom we exist.  Cf. ^Conv.~, IV, 
xii, 138-57. 

	|112.~  `It follows, if I judge rightly in my 
distinctions.'  ^Resta~ is used like the scholastic ^relinquitur~
or ^restat.~ 

	|114.  In vostro limo~, `in your (mortal) clay.' 

	|115, 116.~  `There is the man who hopes to excel through 
his neighbor being crushed down,' i.e., `by the abasement of his 
neighbor.' 

	|117.  El~ is the neighbor. 

	|119.  Perch' altri sormonti~, `because another may 
rise,' i.e., `through another's success.' 

	|120.  Il contrario~: `the contrary' of another's 
success.

vi, Art. 3: `solus Deus est bonus per suam essentiam.' 

	|138.  Si ragiona~, `it is expounded.' 

	|139.  Tacciolo~, `I withhold it,' i.e., `I tell thee 
not.'
