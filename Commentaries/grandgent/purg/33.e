	|1.~  Ps. lxxix (Vulg. lxxviii), 1: `^O God, the heathen are
come~ into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled.' 
This psalm, depicting the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Chaldaeans, and closing with a prayer for restoration, is now
applied to the profanation of the Church described at the end of
Canto XXXII.  The Theological and the Cardinal Virtues sing the 
verses alternately. 

	|5.  S@i fatta~, `with such an expression.' 

	|6.~  Mary at the foot of the cross -- the ^Mater dolorosa~
of art and song -- was scarcely more altered by grief than
Beatrice. 

	|7.  Dier~ = ^diedero.~ 

	|10.~  In answer to the complaint and prayer of the Virtues,
Beatrice repeats the prophecy of Christ to his disciples in John
xvi, 16: `A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a
little while, and ye shall see me.'  Truth, as revealed through
the Church, shall be hidden for a time, but shall shine forth
again. 

	|14.  Solo accennando~, `merely beckoning': she had no need
to speak. 

	|15.  Donna~: Matilda. -- |Savio~: Statius. 

	|17.~  The 9 to 10 steps probably represent a period of over
9 years, between 1305, when Clement V was induced by Philip the
Fair to make Avignon the seat of the Papacy, and 1314, when both
Clement and Philip died.  After their death the world was in a
better condition to expect a redeemer.  Cf. E. Gorra in
^M$elanges Chabaneau~, 1907, 585.  Moore, III, 263, offers a 
different explanation. 

	|22.  S@i com'~, `as soon as.' -- |Seco~, `with her.' 

	|23.  T' attenti~, `thou venturest.' 

	|24.  Domandarmi~, `question me.' 

	|34.~  The `vessel' is the chariot, and the `serpent' is the
dragon of XXXII, 131. 

	|35.~  Rev. xvii, 8: `The beast that thou sawest was, and is
not.'  The material Church has ceased to exist. -- |Chi n' ha
colpa~, `he who is to blame': Clement and Philip shall both be 
stricken down (cf. l. 17). 

	|36.~  `God's vengeance fears no bullying,' like that of the
harlot by the giant.  It seems that ^suppe~, in the colloquial
language, sometimes had this sense: see D. Guerri in ^Giorn.
stor.~, LIII, 297, and ^Bull.~, XXVI, 149.  See also G. Giani and
G. Mazzoni in ^Giorn. stor.~, XXIII, 47, 141, and in ^Stud.
dant.~, V, 148.  The old and most of the modern commentators
explain the verse as a reference to a hypothetical custom of
eating sops on a murdered man's grave.  Tor., 624-5, suggests an
emendation. 

	|37.  Reda~, `heir': note the rimes in -^eda~ in the 
prophetic lines 13 and 15 of Canto XX. -- In ^Conv.~, IV, iii, 
38-43, Dante calls Frederick II, who died in 1250, the last Roman
Emperor -- `^ultimo~ dico per rispetto al tempo presente, non 
ostante che Ridolfo e Adolfo e Alberto poi eletti sieno appresso
la sua morte e de' suoi discendenti,' inasmuch as these three 
never came to Italy.  Cf. VI, 97; VII, 94. 

	|41-42.~  `Stars -- safe from every let and hindrance -- on
the point of giving us a time'... 

	|44.  Fuia~: the `thief' is the harlot who has usurped the
place of the rightful authority. 

	|45.  Delinque~, `sins.' 

	|48.~  `Because it clouds the understanding, as they did.' 
|Attuia~ is a new word. 

	|51.~  Themis, to avenge the death of the Sphinx, sent the
Thebans a beast to lay waste their flocks and fields: ^Met.~,
VII, 763 ff.  But the followers of the new Oedipus, the Redeemer
to come, will have nothing to fear from Themis, the goddess of
Justice. 

	|57.~  The tree of Law has been despoiled by Adam and by the
giant. 

	|59.  Bestemmia di fatto~, `blasphemy of deed.' 

	|61.  Per~, `because of.' 

	|62-63.~  Adam longed for redemption by Christ, -- who took
upon himself the punishment for Adam's sin, -- during more than
5000 years, i.e., 930 on earth (Gen. v, 5) and 4302 in Limbus
(^Par.~ XXVI, 118-20).  According to the chronology of Eusebius,
Christ was born in the year 5200 after the creation. 

	|65.  Singular cagione~, `a special reason.' -- |Eccelsa~:
cf. XXXII, 41-2. 

	|66.  Travolta~: cf. XXXII, 40-1. 

	|67.~  The water of the Tuscan river, Elsa, coats with 
carbonate of lime anything that falls into it.  The `vain 
thoughts' have petrified Dante's mind. 

	|69.~  His `delight in them' has discolored his mind, as the
blood of Pyramus stained the mulberry: cf. XXVII, 39. 

	|72.~  `Thou wouldst have recognized in the tree, in the
moral sense.' 

	|77.  Il~: ^detto~, l. 75. -- |Per quello~, `for the same
reason' (cf. XV, 133): pilgrims bring back their `staff wreathed
with palm' from the Holy Land, to show where they have been and 
what they have seen. 

	|84.  S' aiuta~, `it strives.' 

	|85.  Conoschi~ = ^(tu) conosca.~ -- |Scuola~: the `school'
of those who live according to the senses, and thus become deaf
and blind to spiritual truth.  Or, possibly, the `school' of
sophistry which Dante followed when writing the ^Convivio.~
Parodi, 527 ff., thinks the reference is to those who put Church
before Empire. 

	|86.  Veggi~ = ^(tu) veda.~ 

	|87.  Come~, `how (little).' 

	|90.  Il ciel~: the Primum Mobile, the swiftest and most
distant of the heavens.  -- Cf. Isaiah lv, 9: `For as the heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts.' 

	|96.  Ancoi~, `this day': cf. XIII, 52; XX, 70. 

	|98.  Chiaro conchiude~, `clearly proves.' 

	|99.~  `That there was guilt in the turning of thy desire to
another quarter.'  Inasmuch as Lethe removes only the memory of
^sin~, the fact that he has now forgotten his recreancy to
Beatrice -- which he remembered just before drinking of the
stream (XXXI, 34-6) -- proves that this estrangement was sinful. 

	|100.  Veramente~, `be that as it may.' 

	|103.~  It is noon.  When the sun is overhead, it seems to
move slower than when it is near the horizon: cf. ^Par.~ XXIII,
11-2. 

	|105.~  The `noonday circle,' or meridian, `shifts to one
side and the other according to the point of view': it is not a 
fixed line, like the equator. 

	|106.  S' affisser~, `stopped.' 

	|108.~  `If he finds something strange, or any indication of
it.' 

	|109.~  The `pallid shade' is a dark pool under the trees. 

	|110.  Nigri~ = ^neri.~ 

	|111.  Sovra~: at the source of... 

	|112.~  Boethius, ^Cons.~, V, Metr. i, 3-4: 

     `Tigris et Euphrates uno se fonte resolvunt 
     Et mox abjunctis dissociantur aquis.' 

Cf. Lucan, ^Phars.~, III, 256-9.  So Brunetto Latini in the
^Tr$esor~ and St. Isidore in the ^Origines~ (both citing Sallust
as an authority) describe these two rivers as coming from the 
same source. -- Obliviousness to evil and consciousness of good 
spring from the same spiritual condition, and neither can be 
complete without the other (XXVIII, 131-2). 

	|115.~  John viii, 12: `I am the light of the world.' 

	|116.  Si dispiega~, `gushes.' 

	|119.~  This is the only mention of the lady's name. 

	|120.  Da colpa si dislega~, `frees himself from blame.' 

	|123.~  There can be no guilt in any words spoken by
Matilda, the personification of Innocence. 

	|125.  Priva~, `robs.' -- Remorse for his sin had made Dante
forget the promise of good (XXVIII, 127-33); now the recollection
of sin has been removed by Lethe, and the memory of the good that
is his due must be revived by Eunoe. 

	|126.~  `Has darkened his mental eyes.' 

	|128.~  Apparently Matilda performs this office for all
souls that reach this stage.  The complete restoration of 
Innocence implies that all evil is banished from the mind and the
memory of all good is revived. 

	|135.  Donnescamente~, `with womanly grace.' -- Statius now
disappears from the narrative. 

	|144.~  Cf. Ephesians iv, 23: `And be renewed in the spirit
of your mind.' 

	|145.~  Like the first and third, this second ^cantica~ ends
with the word |stelle~ pointing to the goal of Dante's journey.
