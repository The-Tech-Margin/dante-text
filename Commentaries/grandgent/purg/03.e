	|Proemio.~ WHERE the circular mountain descends to the shore, a high
cliff forms its base all around; and outside this cliff creep
the souls
of those who died excommunicated but repentant.  Like the
other
classes of the 'negligent,' whom we shall meet later, they are
compelled to postpone their entrance into Purgatory until they
have
made amends for their neglect.  The contumacious spirits of
this
canto are condemned to wait thirty times as long as their
contumacy
lasted.  Dante here insists upon the doctrine that the
eternal fate of the soul depends upon its real state at the
moment
of death, and not upon the blessing or anathema of the Church. 
'By their curse' -- the curse of the clergy -- 'the eternal
love is
not irrevocably lost, so long as hope has a bit of green.' 
According
to St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologi@ae@~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. xxi,
Art. 4,
an unjust excommunication is ineffective.  Nevertheless, their
rebellion against God's earthly vicar demands expiation, and
their humble waiting at the very foot of the mountain is a
fitting
atonement.  This penalty Dante seems to have assigned on his
own authority.

	Among the excluded is Manfred, the natural son of the
Emperor Frederick II, crowned king of Sicily in 1258. 
Handsome,
cultivated, winning, able in war and peace, he was the
idolized
chief of the Ghibellines and, like his father, the hated and
excommunicated opponent of the Papacy.  In February, 1266, on
a
plain near Benevento, he was defeated and slain by St. Louis's
brother, Charles of Anjou, to whom two Popes, Urban IV and
Clement IV, had offered the throne of Sicily.  His body was
interred on the battlefield, at the end of the Valentino
bridge, on
the right bank of the Calore; and a mound of stones was piled
over the grave.  But this land was Church property.  When
Clement heard of the burial, he sent the Archbishop of Cosenza
to cast out the corpse, and Manfred's remains were deposited,
with no funeral rites, outside the kingdom he had lost, on the
bank of the Garigliano, or 'Verde,' which formed a part of its
northern boundary.  Dante's is the earliest account we have of
this episode.  The wretched disposal of Manfred's bones is in
striking contrast to the magnificent translation of Virgil's
body, to
which reference is made in this canto.

	When Manfred has appeared to Dante, and the latter has
'modestly disclaimed' previous acquaintance with him, he
reveals
himself as the grandson of the Empress Constance, who, in
the ^Paradiso~ III, 118, is called 'la gran Costanza.' 
Daughter and
heiress of Roger II of Sicily, the last of the Norman kings,
she
married the Emperor Henry VI, the second of the Swabians,
and gave birth to Frederick II.  Manfred named his daughter
after her.  This second Constance, wedded in 1262 to Peter III
of
Aragon (cf. VII, 112 ff.), was the mother of Frederick and
James,
who became kings respectively of Sicily and Aragon.  Their
loving
grandfather here calls them 'the glory' of these kingdoms;
Dante
himself, as we learn from various passages in his works, had a
different opinion of them.  Manfred hopes that his daughter,
when she knows his state, will shorten by prayer his term of
exclusion.  The belief that the journey of repentant souls to
Heaven is hastened by the prayers of the living is an accepted
doctrine of the Church, and Dante repeatedly dwells upon it. 
Manfred's repentance and consequent salvation are probably
not of Dante's invention.  In the ^Imago Mundi~ of Jacopo da
Acqui, written only some ten or twenty years after Dante's
time,
it is recorded that Manfred saved himself by exclaiming just
before death: 'Deus propitius esto mihi peccatori!'  The
incident
as it appears in the ^Purgatorio~ is, therefore, presumably
based on
a tradition already current.  If the passage was written as
late as
1317, it has a particular significance, for in that year
another great
Ghibelline leader, Dante's patron, Can Grande della Scala, was
excommunicated by John XXII.  He remained under the ban
until his death.

	|1.  Avvegna che~ (sometimes printed as one word),
`although.'

	|3.  Fruga~, `goads.' 

	|4.  Compagna~ = ^compagnia.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI, 101. 

	|7.~  Reason itself has momentarily been at fault. 

	|10.  Lasciar~ = ^lasciarono.~ 

	|11.  Dismaga~, `removes': cf. XXVII, 104.  Haste `deprives
every act of dignity': cf. VI, 63. 

	|13.  Vaga~, `curious,' `eager.' 

	|15.  Si dislaga~, `unlakes itself,' i.e., rises from the
great lake of the ocean. 

	|16.~  The poets begin their journey on the east side of the
island.  When Dante turns and faces the mountain, the rising sun
is
behind him. 

	|17, 18.  A la figura~, etc., `in that shape which the
stoppage of its rays had in me': the shadow has the same outline
as
the body which, by obstructing the sunlight, casts the shade. 

	|21.~  Until now Dante has not had occasion to observe that
spirits cast no shadow, and he is startled on seeing his own
shadow without Virgil's.  In several passages of the ^Purgatorio~
the poet makes effective use of the opaqueness of the human body.

	|25-27.~  `The body in which I (the soul) used to cast a
shadow is buried in a place where it is now evening.'  |Vespero~
is the last three hours of the day.  Italy, according to Dante's
geography, is midway between Jerusalem and Gibraltar, that is,
45+o~, or three hours, west of Jerusalem; its time is therefore
three hours earlier than that of Jerusalem.  It is some time
after sunrise in Purgatory, as long after sunset in Jerusalem,
and the same amount after mid-afternoon in Italy. -- Virgil died
in Brundusium, but was buried by Augustus in Naples. 

	|30.~  The nine concentric heavens being transparent, no one
of them screens the sun's light from another.  Cf. ^Conv.~, II,
vii, 89-100. 

	|31.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 87. 

	|32.  La Virt@u~, `that Power.'  See XXV, 79 ff.; also the
second paragraph of the argument to Canto II.

	|36.  Che~ is the object, |sustanzia~ the subject: the
course which the triune God pursues. 

	|37.~  In scholastic logic a demonstration ^a priori~, from
cause to effect, was called ^propter quid~, and a demonstration
^a posteriori~, from effect to cause, was called ^quia.~  The
meaning of this line, therefore, is as follows: be satisfied with
knowing the effects, and, through them, as far as may be, the
maker; do not try to put yourselves in his place and guess his
motives.  Cf. ^Conv.~, III, viii, 139-46. 

	|38, 39.~  If man had been all-knowing, there would have
been no sin, and consequently no atonement: `Mary would not have
had to bear child.' -- |Possuto~ = ^potuto.~ 

	|40, 41.~  If human knowledge had sufficed, the vain longing
of the ancient sages (which torments them through eternity) would
have been satisfied.  Cf. ^Georgics~, II, 490: 

     `Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.' 

	|45.~  Once more we have a pathetic reminder that Virgil is
one of those whose desire will never be stilled. 

	|48.  Sarien~ = ^sarebbero.~ 

	|49.  Turb@ia~ is near Monaco; ^L@erici~, now Lerice, is on
the Gulf of Spezia, near Sarzana, where Dante was in 1306.  At
Lerice Shelley resided; and thence he departed on his fatal sail.
Between these places the mountains descend steeply to the sea. 

	|51.  Verso di~, `compared with.' 

	|56.~  Virgil questions `his mind about the road.'  Reason
is accustomed to look with itself for knowledge; the human Dante,
however, looks without, and in this particular instance it is 
apparent that his method is the more successful. 

	|58.  Gente~, `crowd,' `flock.' 

	|59.  Movieno~ = ^movevano.~ -- |Ver~ = ^verso.~ 

	|64.  A loro~: some texts have ^allora.~ -- |Libero piglio~,
`an air of self-reliance.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXII, 75. 

	|65.~  In Hell the regular course is to the left; in
Purgatory the course is always to the right.  Virgil and Dante,
however, now turn to the left (i.e., the south) to mingle with
the slowly approaching crowd; hence the astonishment of the
shades, ll. 70-2. 

	|73.~  The fate of the souls on this island seems to Virgil
the more happy by comparison with his own. 

	|78.~  Cf. ^Conv.~, IV, ii, 88-90. 

	|82.  E l' altre~, `the others likewise.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIX,
3. 

	|84.  Imperch@e~, `wherefore.' 

	|89.~  As Dante is now facing south, the morning sun is at
his left and his shadow falls on the cliff at his right. 

	|91.  Restaro~ = ^restarono.~ 

	|92.  Venieno~ = ^venivano.~ 

	|93.  Fenno~ = ^fecero.~ 

	|99.  Cerchi~, `he is striving.' 

	|101.  Intrate~ = ^entrate~, `proceed.' 

	|107.~  Cf. 1 Samuel xvi 12: (David) `Now he was ruddy, and
withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at.' 

	|115.  Vadi~ = ^vada.~ 

	|116.  Cicilia~ is still used for ^Sicilia~: cf. ^Inf.~ XI,
108. 

	|117.  Dichi~ = ^dica.~ 

	|122.~  Cf. Ps. li (Vulg. l); also John vi, 37, `him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.' 

	|126.~  If the Archbishop of Cosenza, sent by Clement IV to
hunt me down, `had read aright this page in God's book' -- i.e.,
one of the passages referred to in the preceding note. 

	|128.  Co~ is a dialect form for ^capo~: cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 76. 

	|129.  Mora~, `pile' of stones. 

	|132.  A lume spento~: without candles, as was customary in
the burial of the excommunicated. 

	|135.~  Green is the color of hope.

	|138.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 327-30. 

	|139.~  Why thirty?  See E. G. Gardner in the ^Modern
Language Review~, IX, 63.  In Deut. xxxiv, 8, we read: `the
children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty
days.'  Hence the early Christian practice of saying prayers for
the dead for thirty days after decease.  Out of this grew the
`Trental of St. Gregory,' or thirty masses on thirty feast days
through the year. 

	|144.  Divieto~: the `prohibition' of entering Purgatory.
