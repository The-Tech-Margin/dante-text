	|1.~  The Septentrion is the constellation of Ursa Minor,
the Little Dipper, which contains the North Star, the sailors' 
guide.  The seven candlesticks, representing the sevenfold Spirit
of the Lord, are called the Septentrion, or sevenfold guiding
light, of the `first heaven,' or Empyrean. -- |Settentrion~ is
the subject of ^si affisse~ in l. 7. 

	|3.~  Nothing but man's sinfulness has ever hidden from him
the light of the Spirit of the Lord. 

	|4.  L$i~: in the procession of the Church. 

	|5.  Il pi@u basso~ (sc., ^settentrion~): the real Ursa 
Minor, in the starry sphere, below the Empyrean. 

	|6.  Qual~, `him who': the helmsman. 

	|7.~  The `truthful people' are the elders representing the
prophetic Old Testament. 

	|10.~  The one who stands for the Song of Solomon. 

	|11.~  Song of Solomon iv, 8: `Come with me from Lebanon, 
my spouse.'  The `spouse' is the Church.  In the Vulgate the word
^veni~, `come,' occurs three times. 

	|13.  Novissimo bando~, `last trump.' 

	|15.~  Note that in this line we have an absolute
construction. -- Rev. xix, 1: `And after those things I heard a 
great voice of much people in Heaven, saying, Alleluia.' 

	|16.  Basterna~, `carriage.' 

	|17.~  A hundred angels suddenly arose `at the voice of so
great an elder.'  The Latin, appropriate enough to the
ecclesiastical tone of the whole passage is evidently needed here
to prepare for the coming rimes. 

	|19.~  Mat. xxi, 9: `And the multitudes that went before,
and that followed' (Christ as he entered Jerusalem), `cried, 
saying, Hosanna to the son of David: ^Blessed is he that cometh~
in the name of the Lord.'  The last clause is taken from Ps. 
cxviii (Vulg. cxvii), 26.  Dante changes ^venit~, `cometh,' to 
|venis~, `comest.'  These are the last words sung by the 
assistants before the canon of the Mass; they express the 
expectation of the bodily coming of Christ. -- The elder has sung
the invitation of Christ to the Church; the angels in the chariot
of the Church now respond with the greeting to Christ. 

	|21.  Aen.~, vi, 883: `Oh, give lilies with full hands!'  On
the point of dismissing Virgil from his narrative, Dante pays him
the supreme honor of putting a phrase from his ^Aeneid~ into the
mouth of angels, together with words from the Bible.  The
exclamation `O' is inserted by Dante. 

	|22.  Io vidi gi@a~, `I have sometimes seen.' 

	|26.  Temperanza~, `tempering.' 

	|31.~  `Garlanded with olive over a white veil.'  Olive is
the emblem of peace.  It suggests also the aureole of the doctor;
cf. l. 68.  In these three lines are the colors of the three
Christian virtues; but green, the symbol of hope, really occurs
twice.  In XXXI, 116, Beatrice's eyes, too, are green; and in
^Par.~ XXXI, 79, she is addressed as `donna in cui mia ^speranza
vige.~' 

	|35-36.~  `Had been so long without being stricken with awe,
trembling, in her presence.'  Cf. ^V. N.~, II, 19-25; XI, 17-25;
XIV, 24-34; XXIV, 1-5.  As Beatrice had died in 1290 (V. ^N.~,
XXX, 7-13), Dante had not seen her, except in dreams, for ten
years: cf. ^Purg.~ XXXII, 2. 

	|42.~  When Dante first saw Beatrice, he was not yet nine 
years old: ^V. N~, II, 1-6. 

	|43.  Rispita~, `expectation,' is a noun that has its 
derivation from the old verb ^ri-~ or ^re-spittare~, `expect,' 
which occurs in the ^Fiore.~  The word has been used also by G. 
Villani.  In Boccaccio's ^Filostrato~ it occurs repeatedly, 
meaning `delay'; e.g., VII, cv, 5.  We find it used in Old French
in the sense of `expression.' 

	|48.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, IV, 23: `Agnosco veteris vestigia
flammae.'

	|49.  Scemi~, `bereft.'  This parting, so intensely pathetic
in the literal narrative, corresponds spiritually to the shock
experienced by the soul passing from the guidance of Reason to
that of divine Authority. 

	|52.  Not all Eden... 

	|53.~  `Could prevent my dew-cleansed cheeks': cf. I, 121-9.

	|54.~  `From being darkened once more by weeping.'-- In some
texts ^adre~ = ^alre~ on the model of ^padre~, ^madre.~ 

	|55.  Perch@e~, `though.' 

	|56.  Anco~, `yet.' 

	|57.~  Hebrews iv, 12: `For the word of God is quick, and 
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to
the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the 
heart.' 

	|59.  Ministra~, `serves.'  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 302: `Ipse ratem
conto subigit, velisque ministrat.' 

	|67.  Tutto che~, `although.' 

	|68.  Cerchiato~ `wreathed.' -- The olive was sacred to 
Minerva.  The phrase perhaps suggests that peace comes through 
knowledge; cf. the `warfare of ignorance' in XX, 145. 

	|70.  Proterva~, `wrathful.'  Her anger shows itself in the
impetuousness of the followinb speech. 

	|72.  Il pi$u caldo~: his hottest rebukes. -- |Dietro
serva~, `reserves for the end.'  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, ix, 9-13. 

	|73.~  Many texts have ^sem~ (= ^siamo~) for |son.~ 
Beatrice speaks in the first person plural, like a monarch. 

	|74.  Degnasti~, `hast thou deigned.'  From the
imperiousness of the first line, she passes abruptly to the irony
of the second, and thence, with equal suddenness, to the direct
rebuke of the third. -- Cf. Ps. xxiv (Vulg. xxiii), 3, 4. 

	|75.  Sapei~ = ^sapevi.~ 

	|77.  I~ = ^li.~ -- Contrition is caused by seeing our real
selves. 

	|81.  Acerba~, `unripe': pity that is not yet ready to
reveal itself. 

	|83.~  Ps. xxxi (Vulg. xxx): `In thee, O Lord, do I put my
trust.'  It expresses trust and gratitude, and prays for
continued defence and deliverance. 

	|84.~  Verse 8 (Vulg. 9) ends with: `thou hast set ^my feet~
in a large room (Vulg.: `statuisti in loco spatioso ^pedes
meos~').  After this verse the tone of the psalm is rather
mournful than jubilant. 

	|85.~  The `living rafters' are trees. 

	|86.~  The `back of Italy' is the Apennine range. 

	|87.  Stretta~, `packed.' -- |Schiavi~, `Slavic.' 

	|89.  Pur che~, `if but.' -- `The land that loses shadow' is
the African desert, where the sun is sometimes directly overhead. 

	|90.~  Cf. Ps. lxviii, 2 (Vulg. lxvii,) `as wax melteth
before the fire.' 

	|92.  Notan~, `sing.' 

	|93.~  In harmony with the music of the spheres.  Cf. ^Par.~
I, 78, 82. 

	|94.  Tempre~, `airs.'

	|96.  Stempre~, `confoundest.' 

	|98.  Fessi~ = ^si fece.~ -- It is the pity of the angels
that finally awakens complete contrition of the heart, the first
stage of the sacrament of penance. 

	|100.  Detta coscia~, `aforesaid (l. 61) flank' of the
chariot. 

	|101.~  The `kindly substances' are the angels. 

	|103.  Die~ = ^d@i~, `day.' 

	|104.  A voi...fura~, `steals from you' a single step of the
world's course. 

	|106.  @E con pi@u cura~, `is more concerned.' 

	|109.~  The `great wheels' are the revolving heavens, which
determine, by the arrangement of the stars at his birth, the
disposition of every human being. 

	|112.~  God bestows upon every individual a special degree
of grace, upon which his keenness of spiritual vision depends. 
The reasons that govern God's uneven distribution of grace
neither men nor angels can fathom.  His graces rain down from so
high -- `have such high vapors for their rain' (l. 113) -- that
no eye can approach their source.  See St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologiae rima, Qu. lvii, Art. 5.  Cf. ^Conv.~, IV, xxi, 100-5. 

	|115.  Questi~: Dante. -- |Nova~, `young.' 

	|116.  Virtualmente~, `potentially.' -- |Abito destro~, 
`right disposition.' 

	|125.~  The `second age,' ^giovent@u~, begins at 25: see 
^Conv.~, IV, xxiv, 3-5, 11-3. -- Dante was born (probably) in 
May, 1265.  Beatrice, who was nearly a year younger (^V. N.~, 
II, 9-15), was doubtless born in the first third of 1266.  She 
died in June, 1290: ^V. N.~, XXX, 1-13. -- |Mutai~: `changed' the
temporal for the eternal. 

	|126.  Diessi~ = ^si diede.~ 

	|131.~  Boethius uses the phrase `imagines veri boni' in 
^Cons.~, III, Pr. ix.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XVI, 91. 

	|132.  Promission~, `promise': cf. XXVIII, 138. -- Cf.
^Cons.~, III, Pr. viii: `haee quae nec praestare quae pollicentur
bona possunt.' 

	|133.~  `And it availed me not to obtain (from God)
inspirations.'  See ^V. N.~, XL, 1-26; XLII, Sonnet XXV; XLIII, 
1-6. 

	|136.  Argomenti~, `means.' 

	|142.  Fato~, `decree.' 

	|143.~  The `viand' is the living water of Lethe. 

	|144.  Scotto~ `payment.'  It would be contrary to God's
justice to allow forgetfulness of sin without previous
contrition.
