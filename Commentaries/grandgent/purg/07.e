	|Proemio.~ 'WALK while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon
you:
for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth'
(John xii, 35).  In ll. 107-8 of the first canto the wayfarers
were
told that the sun -- the emblem of spiritual enlightenment, or
righteous choice -- was to be their guide in their upward
journey;
now (and again in XVII, 62-3 and XXVII, 74-5) they learn that
without that guidance they cannot ascend at all.  The life of
the
penitent is divided between the day of active advancement on
the
path of reformation, where every step must be wisely directed,
and the night of prayerful meditation.  Day is ushered in by
the
constellation of cardinal, or practical, virtues, Prudence,
Temperance,
Fortitude, Justice (I, 22-7); night, by the three bright stars
of Christian contemplation, the theological virtues of Faith,
Hope, and Love (VIII, 85-93).

	Each of the three nights passed by Dante on the island is
spent
in repose.  His first resting-place is the beautiful Valley of
the
Princes, a hollow in the mountain-side, where are gathered
great
rulers whose worldly cares made them postpone until the last
moment their reconciliation with God.  Those who were enemies
on earth sit side by side in fraternal harmony, Rudolph of
Hapsburg with Ottocar of Bohemia, Charles of Anjou with Peter
of
Aragon.  Here, as in the first life, Sordello is the judge of
kings:
he points out and describes to the travelers the dwellers in
the
dale.  The conception of this charming, peaceful spot was
probably
suggested to Dante -- as was that of the Noble Castle of
^Inf.~ IV, 106 -- by Virgil's picture of the Elysian Fields in
^Aen.~,
VI, 637 ff.  As Sordello shows the dell to Virgil and Dante
from
a bank, so Anchises leads the Sibyl and Aeneas to a height
(754-5):

     'Et tumulum capit, unde omnes longo ordine possit
     Adversos legere, et venientum discere vultus.'

In both poems the spirits are seen reclining on the
greensward,
singing together (656-7):

     'Conspicit ecce alios dextra laevaque per herbam
     Vescentes, laetumque choro paeana canentes.'

Like Sordello, Anchises surveys and recognizes souls destined
to
rise (679-81):

     'At pater Anchises penitus convalle virenti
     Inclusas animas, superumque ad lumen ituras,
     Lustrabat studio recolens.'

One may compare also Lucian's Isle of the Blest in the ^True
History~, II.

	There is a correspondence between the Nobile Castello and
the Valle,
representing respectively nobility of mind and of birth: see
F. Bartoli
in ^Rivista d'Italia~, XXIII, 312.  Dante, we may be sure,
aspired to both
distinctions, aristocracy of intellect and of family.

	|3.~  Not until he has lovingly greeted his countryman
several times does Sordello ask his name.  Dante remains
comparatively unnoticed until Canto VIII, l. 62. 

	|4.~  Before the descent of Christ into Hell no souls went
to Purgatory or Heaven: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 63.  Ever since the
redemption the souls of the elect have reached Heaven through
Purgatory.  Virgil died in 19 A.D. 

	|6.~  Cf: III, 27. 

	|8, 10, 12~ are ^versi tronchi~: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 56; ^Purg.~
IV, 47. 

	|15.~  `The inferior lays hold' -- i.e., clasps his superior
-- either under the arms (d' Ovidio, 12) or at the feet (XXI,
130).

	|18.~  Mantua issued coins bearing Virgil's image, and in
the 14th century erected a statue to him. 

	|21.  Chiostra~: cf. ^Inf.~ XXIX, 40. 

	|30.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 26. 

	|33.~  Before baptism: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 35-6; ^Par.~ XXXII,
40-5, 82-4. 

	|36.~  Though the virtuous souls in Limbus were ignorant of
the three theological virtues, `they knew the others' -- the four
cardinal virtues -- `and followed them all.'  See the third
paragraph of the Argument to Canto I. 

	|39.  Dritto inizio~, `real beginning.' 

	|40.  Certo~, `fixed.' -- |Posto~, `assigned.' 

	|44.  Puote~ = ^pu@o.~ 

	|47.  Merr@o~ = ^mener@o~: cf. ^V. N.~, Canzone I, 87. 

	|48.  Fier~ = ^saranno.~ 

	|50.  Fora~ = ^sarebbe.~ 

	|51.  Sarria~ = ^salirebbe.~  `Would he not climb because he
had not the power?' 

	|55.  Briga~, `hindrance': to going up (l. 56). 

	|56.  Che~, `than,' dependent on ^altra~ in l. 55. 

	|57.  Intriga~, `impedes.' 

	|58.  Poria~ = ^potrebbe.~ -- |Lei~: ^tenebra~ (l. 56). 

	|64.  Lici~ = ^l@i.~ 

	|66.~  `Just as valleys hollow them (i.e., mountains) here
(with us).' 

	|68.  Face~ = ^fa.~ 

	|70.~  `There was a slanting path, neither steep nor level.'

	|71.  In fianco de la lacca~, `to the edge of the dingle':
cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 16. 

	|72.~  `At a point where the bank was more than half gone.' 
The sloping valley opens out as it descends, and its banks
diminish until they blend into the mountain-side. 

	|73.  Cocco e biacca~, `cochineal and white lead,' from
which red and white colors were extracted.  The pigments named
here were really used by artists. 

	|74.  Indaco legno~ is probably amber, which, according to
Pliny, is a tree-gum that sometimes comes from India: cf.
^Publications of the Modern Language Association of America~,
XVIII, 356.  Most commentators take it to mean `indigo,' but the
epithets ^lucido e sereno~ fit amber much better.  Other texts
read: `indaco, legno lucido e sereno,' meaning `indigo, bright,
clear wood.'  For |legno~, H. D. Austin, in ^Modern Language
Notes~, XXXVII, 36, has suggested ^lychnis~ or ^lignis~, a bright
purple gem coming mainly from India, mentioned by Pliny, Solinus,
and Isidore. 

	|75.  Fiacca~, `splits.' 

	|76, 77.~ `Each (of the things just enumerated) would be
surpassed in color by the grass and flowers set within that
dale.' 

	|78.  Il meno~, `the less,' i.e., the inferior thing. 

	|79.  Non...pur...dipinto~, `not merely painted.' 

	|81.  Uno~: supply ^odore.~  `Nature had made a single vague
and mysterious one.' 

	|82.  Salve Regina~ is an antiphon recited after sunset in
the service of certain seasons.  It is an appeal to Mary from the
`exiled sons of Eve' `in this valley of tears.' 

	|84.  Per la valle non parean~, `on account of the
depression, were not visible.' 

	|88.  Balzo~: cf. IV, 47. 

	|89.  Tutti quanti~, `all of them.' 

	|90.  Lama~, `level,' bottom: cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 79. 

	|94.~  Rudolph of Hapsburg, crowned Emperor at Aix-la-
Chapelle in 1273, was the first of the Austrian Emperors.  Cf.
VI, 103. -- |Potea sanar~, `might have cured.' 

	|96.  Tardi...si ricrea~, `she will not soon be revived.' 
For this use of the present, cf. XIV, 66. 

	|97.  L'altro~, `the next.' -- |Ne la vista~, `as his
expression shows.' 

	|98.~  Bohemia. 

	|99.  Molta~, `Moldau.' -- |Albia~, `Elbe.' 

	|100.~  Ottocar II, King of Bohemia and Duke of Austria, was
killed, in 1278, in war with Rudolph, whom he would not recognize
as King of Rome. -- |Fasce~, `swaddling clothes': he was worth
more in his infancy than his son Wenceslaus in mature age. 

	|101.~  Wenceslaus IV, son and heir of Ottocar, son-in- law
of Rudolph.  He lived until 1305.  Cf. ^Par.~ XIX, 125.

	|102.  Pasce~: i.e., ^pascono.~ 

	|103.~  `Small-Nose' is Philip III, the Bold, of France, son
and successor of Louis IX, and nephew of Charles of Anjou. To
help his uncle against Peter of Aragon (l. 112), whom the
Sicilian revolutionists had elected king, he invaded Catalonia by
land and by sea; but his fleet was defeated, and his army, which
had contracted the plague, was obliged to flee.  The king himself
died at Perpignan in 1285. 

	|104.~  Henry the Fat of Navarre, brother and successor of
the Thibault of ^Inf.~ XXII, 52, died in 1274. 

	|107.  L'altro~: Henry. 

	|109.~  Philip the Bold was father, Henry the Fat was
father-in-law, of the `Curse of France,' Philip IV, the Fair.  In
the many passages in which Dante assails this sovereign (who did
so much harm to Italy and the Church), he avoids mentioning his
name.  He died in 1314: cf. ^Par.~ XIX, 120. 

	|112.~  The `large-limbed' sovereign is Peter III of Aragon,
the husband of Manfred's daughter Constance (cf. III, 115),
elected king of Sicily when the French were expelled in 1282.  He
died in 1285. 

	|113.~  `The one with the masculine nose' is Charles of
Anjou, brother of Louis IX of France, and conqueror of Naples and
Sicily. 

	|114.~  Cf. Isaiah xi, 5: `And righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.' 

	|116.~  Alfonso III, Peter's oldest son, succeeded his
father as king of Aragon, but died while still young in 1291.  He
so little deserved Dante's praise that some commentators think
the |giovanetto~ must have been the youngest brother, Peter. 

	|117.~   `Goodness would indeed have been emptied from
vessel to vessel.'  Cf. Jeremiah xlviii, 11. 

	|118.  Rede~ = ^eredi.~ 

	|119.~  James and Frederick, `the other heirs,' i.e., the
second and third sons of Peter, were kings of Aragon and Sicily
when Dante wrote.  Cf. III, 115. 

	|120.~  The `better heritage' is the father's goodness. 

	|123.~  `Crist,' who bestows it, `wol we clayme of him our
gentilesse' (Chaucer, ^Wyf of Bath's Tale~, 1117).  Cf. Epistle
of James i, 17. 

	|126.~  Apulia and Provence `mourn' under the rule of
Charles's degenerate son, Charles II, who died in 1309. 

	|127, 128, 129.~  Charles II is as much inferior to Charles
I as Charles I is to Peter III.  Beatrice of Provence and
Margaret of Burgundy were the successive wives of Charles I,
Constance (daughter of Manfred) was the wife of Peter; and
Charles I was not a devoted husband.  `The plant (the son) is
inferior to the seed (the father) to the same extent that
Constance boasts of her husband (Peter) more than Beatrice and
Margaret boast of theirs (Charles).' 

	|130, 131, 132.~  Henry III of England was reputed to have
little wit; his son, Edward I, was highly esteemed. 

	|134.~  William VII, or `Longsword,' sits in a lower place
on the ground because he is of lower rank than the others. He
was, however, Marquis of Montferrat and Canavese, Imperial vicar,
a great feudal lord and Ghibelline leader. 

	|135-136.~  In 1292 he was treacherously captured at
Alessandria in Piedmont, and was kept in an iron cage until his
death.  His son, to avenge him, attacked Alessandria, but was
defeated, unhappily for his domains.  |E~ (both) |Alessan dria e
la sua guerra~ is the subject of |fa.~
