	|Proemio.~ THE scene just witnessed reminds Dante of a 'favola
d'Isopo,' the story of the frog and the rat.  The tale exists
in
Greek; but the name ^Ysopus~ was given in the Middle Ages to
any
fable collection, and the story in question occurs in several. 
A
frog having offered to tow a rat across a stream, ties itself
to
the animal, jumps in with it, and then treacherously tries to
dive to the bottom expecting to drown its companion.  While
the
rat is struggling to keep afloat, a kite, seeing the
disturbance,
swoops down and carries off both creatures.  The beginning and
the end of the fable, Dante says, are exactly like the recent
episode: that is, the fall of the two grappling fiends into
the
pitch is a reproduction of the plunge of the tethered
quadrupeds
into the water; and their rescue, as they are hooked out by
their
mates, is a counterpart of the seizure of the frog and the rat
by
the kite.

	Our travelers have a narrow escape from the angry devils. 
Virgil, taking Dante in his arms, slides on his back down the
precipitous bank into the sixth ^bolgia~, where they are safe
from pursuit.  They find themselves in the valley of the
hypocrites.  'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites!'
says Mat. xxiii, 27, 'for ye are like unto whited sepulchres,
which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of
dead
men's bones, and of all uncleanness.'  Such is Dante's
conception
of hypocrisy.  In slow and solemn file the souls march by --
'gente dipinta,' painted people, beautiful outward with bright
gold.  They are clad in cloaks of the cut affected by the
monks
of Cluny; and these garments, gilded on the outside, are made
of
crushing lead.  Their cowls hang massive and heavy over their
eyes, their heads are bowed down by the weight they can
scarcely
drag themselves along.  Their enforced decorum, measured pace
and
sidelong glances are all in character; and so is the pious
platitude which one of them sententiously volunteers when
Virgil
discovers how he has been tricked by the Malebranche.  The
exact
form of their punishment was probably suggested to Dante by
the
^Magnae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa, who defines
'ypocrita' as' superauratus,' taking it from {two Greek
words}.

	On the floor of the ditch, pegged down at intervals in
the pathway, where the heavy procession tramples on them as it
passes, are Caiaphas Annas, and the other false councilors who
favored the sacrifice of Christ.  Thinking to destroy him,
they
really crucified their own souls exposing themselves to the
perpetual obloquy of mankind, and assuming the burden of blame
for all subsequent hypocrisy.  Over their ^bolgia~ the bridges
are broken down, shattered by the great earthquake that
accompanied the Saviour's descent.  Here again, in l. 137, the
word ^ruina~ is used.  An impressive picture is that of Virgil
'marveling' over Caiaphas, who was not there at the time of
his
previous journey through Hell.  The crime of this
arch-hypocrite
passes the comprehension of Reason.

	For the 'favola d'Isopo,' see R. McKenzie in ^The
Seventeenth Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge,
Massachusetts~ (1898), pp. 6-13.

	For the lead cape punishment, in tradition and in vision,
see G. L. Hamilton in ^Romanic Review~, XII, 335.  A similar
punishment (not for hypocrisy, but for an angry oath) is
related
by Helinand of Froidmont, as recorded by Vincent de Beauvais,
^Speculum Historiale~ (Venice, 1494), XXIX, cxviii: the soul
of a
clerk appears to a friend, clad in a beautiful lead-colored
cape,
heavier than a tower. -- For hypocrites, see St. Thomas,
^Summa
Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. vi, Art. 5: 'they steal a
reputation among men.'

	|3.  Frati minor~: Franciscans. 

	|7.  Mo~ and |issa~ are synonyms, meaning `now.'  |Issa~ 
is Lucchese. 

	|15.  Noi~ is the present subjunctive of ^noiare~: 
`vexes.' 

	|16.  F@a gueffa~, `is wound' into the hank, i.e., is

	|25.~  If I were a mirror (`leaded glass'), I should not 
catch thy bodily reflection more swiftly than I now receive the 
reflection of thy thought (thine inner image).  Cf. Prov. xxvii,
19. 

	|31.  S' elli @e~, `if it be.'  The `right bank' is the 
declivity leading to the 6th ^bolgia.~ -- |Giaccia~, `slopes.' 

	|32, 34, 36~ are ^versi sdruccioli~: cf. XV, 1.

	|42.  Tanto~, `long enough,' is to be connected to the ^non
s' arresta~ of l. 40.  Fires were not uncommon in Dante's time. 

	|44.  Supin si diede~: he lay on his back and let himself 
go. 

	|45.  Tura~, `stops': the cliff encloses the valley on 
the outer side. 

	|46.  Doccia~, `sluice.' 

	|47.  Molin terragno~, `land mill,' is one situated at a 
distance from the water as opposed to one built on a boat or raft
in a river.  The latter were common in the Arno. 

	|48.~  At the moment when the water pours down on the 
paddles of the millwheel. 

	|49.  Vivagno~, `border,' i.e., bank. 

	|54.  Sovresso~, `just above': ^esso~, originally a 
pronoun or pronominal adjective, came to be attached to 
prepositions as an intensive particle. -- |Non li era 
sospetto~, `there was no fear': |li~ = ^vi.~ 

	|57.  Poder~ = ^potere~, `power.'  |Tolle~ = ^toglie.~ 

	|64.  Elli~, `it.' 

	|66.~  That those which Frederick II put upon criminals 
were, in comparison with these, as light as straw.  The old 
commentators say that Frederick had offenders against the throne 
dressed in leaden cloaks, which were then melted upon them; this
statement is not corroborated by any documentary evidence. 

	|83.~  Their `haste of spirit' could be manifested only 
by the expression of their faces. 

	|84.~  Some of the ^bolge~ are evidently very much 
narrower than others: cf.  XXX, 87. 

	|85.  Bieco~, `sidelong': their heavy, lowered hoods 
prevented them from looking directly. 

	|91.  Collegio~, `college,' i.e., company.

	|103.~  The brethren of the lay order of Beata Maria, 
defenders of the faith and of justice, were not required to lead
an ascetic life, and were nicknamed `Jolly Friars.' 

	|104.~  Catalano de' Malavolti was a Guelf, Loderingo 
degli Andal@o was a Ghibelline.  Both were men of great 
authority, very successful mayors of several cities.  The second
was one of the founders of the order of Beata Maria. 

	|106.~  It was customary in Florence, as in many other 
cities, to choose as mayor for a term of one year some 
distinguished outsider, who was called ^podest@a~ or ^conservator
pacis.~  In 1266, however, instead of `a single man,' two mayors,
one from each party, were elected as a compromise, the 
Ghibellines, in control since 1260, having consented to the 
arrangement, hoping to make peace, before it was too late, with 
the reviving Guelfs.  It was believed that they conspired to 
advance their own interests and to favor the Guelfs, who were 
returning to power after the battle of Benevento.  It is now 
known that they were placed in office and controlled by Pope 
Clement IV.  See ^Bull.~, X, 356.  F. Torraca in ^Stud. dant.~, 
1912, 213. 

	|108.  Gardingo~ was the name of an old Longobard 
fortress in Florence.  Near it were the houses of the Uberti, 
which were destroyed in 1266, when the Ghibellines left the city,
and their site was turned into a public square. 

	|109.~  The movement of this line is exactly like that of 
V, 116, and VI, 58, in which Dante voices his compassion for 
Francesca and Ciacco.  We may infer that he was about to express
pity, probably ironical, for the ^Frati godenti.~  See d' Ovidio,
86-7. 

	|112.  Si distorse~: he writhed with shame at being seen 
by a living man. 

	|114.~  Catalano, who could not see so far ahead, `took 
notice from that,' i.e., from the puffing. 

	|117.~  John xi, 49, 50: `And one of them, named 
Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, 
Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us,
that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation
perish not.'  So xviii, 14. 

	|121.  Il socero~, Annas: John xviii, 13, 24.  |Si 
stenta~, `is racked.'
