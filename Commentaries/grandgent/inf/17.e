	|Proemio.~ THE descent into the darkness, on Geryon's back, is
suggestively pictured in quick, realistic touches.  At first
nothing but the monster himself is visible, and Dante's only
consciousness of motion comes from the upward rush of the air. 
Gradually, at various points below, the fires of the eighth
circle begin to glimmer, and lamentations reach his ear; but
all
is dim and mysterious.

	In classical mythology Geryon, son of Chrysaor and
Callirrho,e, was a three-headed giant king in Spain, who was
killed by Hercules.

     'Tergemini nece Geryonis spoliisque superbus
     Alcides aderat.' -- ^Aen.~, VIII, 202-3.

A passing reference to his shade, as a 'forma tricorporis
umbrae,' is made in ^Aen.~, VI, 289.  To the mediaeval
scholar this triple nature apparently symbolized deceit.
Boccaccio says, in his ^Genealogia Deorum Gentilium~, I, 21,
speaking of Dante's Fraud: 'Et inde Gerion dicta est, quia
regnans apud Baleares insulas Gerion miti vultu blandisque
verbis
et omni comitate consueverit hospites suscipere et demum sub
hac
benignitate sopitos occidere.'  He discusses the classic
Geryon
in XIII, i.

	The monstrous form ascribed to him by Dante was doubtless
suggested in part by the locusts of Rev. ix, 7-11: 'And the
shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle...
and their faces were as the faces of men....  And they had
tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their
tails....  And they had a king over them, which is the angel
of the
bottomless pit....'  St. Thomas, in his commentary on this
passage, tells us that the scorpion has a smooth and gentle
countenance, to induce people to touch it.  The belief that
scorpions have attractive faces seems to have been prevalent.
Dante's image was profoundy modified, however, by Pliny's
description -- followed by Solinus -- of a strange beast
called
Mantichora (^Historia Naturalis~, VIII, 30) which has the face
of
a man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a sting like a
scorpion's.  Similar creatures are portrayed by Albertus
Magnus
(^De Animalibus~, Lib. XXII, Tr. ii, Cap. i) and Brunetto
Latini
(^Tr$esor~, V, Ch. 59); all of these eat human flesh, and of
one
of them it is said that 'deceptos homines devorat.'  In the
Old
French ^Image du monde~, of the first half of the 13th
century,
'Manticare' attracts men by song and devours them.  On the
appropriateness of an upright human face combined with a
scorpion's sting, as an emblem of fraud, there is no need to
dwell.

	See F. Cipolla, ^Il Gerione di Dante~, 1895; B. Soldati
in ^Giorn. stor.~, XLI, 84; R. T. Holbrook, ^Dante and the
Animal
kingdom~, 64.  There are dragons with human faces on the 11th
century fa$cade of the Duomo in Assisi.

	|3.  Appuzza~, `infects.' 

	|6.~  Near the end of the stony edge of the dike, upon 
which the poets had walked. 

	|8.  Arriv@o~ is used in its most literal sense, `brought 
ashore.' 

	|12.  Fusto~, `trunk.'  |Serpente~: cf. Gen. iii, I, `Now 
the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field.' 

	|15.~  In mediaeval pictures, dragons often have their 
whole bodies covered with little rings: cf. R. T. Holbrook, 
^Dante and the Animal kingdom~, 63, 65. 

	|16.  Sommesse~, `woof' (the groundwork).  |Sopraposte~, 
`warp' (the embroidery). 

	|17.  Fer~ = ^fecero~: the object is |drappi~, the 
subject |Tartari n@e Turchi.~  The Tartars and Turks were famous
for their cloths: cf. P. Toynbee in ^Rom.~, XXIX, 559.  At this
line Boccaccio's commentary ends. 

	|18.  Imposte~, `designed.'  Arachne was the famous 
weaver who challenged Minerva to a contest, and was turned into
a spider: ^Met.~, VI, 5 ff. 

	|19.  Burchi~, `skiffs.' 

	|21.  Lurchi~, `gluttonous.' 

	|22.~  It was believed that the beaver caught fish with 
its tail, by dangling it in the water.  In the Middle Ages the 
beaver was associated with Germany.  See A. Sepoleri in ^R. 
Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere~, XLIX, f. v. (March 2, 
1916). 

	|24.~  The sandy desert has an edge of rock, along the 
top of the cliff. 

	|31.~  The poets, on leaving the wood, had mounted the 
nearer or right side of the embankment, and had walked on the 
right side of the stream; now, therefore, they must come down on
the right side, else they would have to cross the boiling blood. 

	|32.  Diece~ is probably used for an indefinite moderate 
number. -- |Stremo~, `verge.' 

	|33.  Cessar~,  `avoid.' 

	|36.~  The usurers, who did violence to human industry, 
are seated on the sand, close to the abyss.

Gianfigliazzi of Florence.

	|63.~  A goose ^argent~ (`whiter than butter') in ^gules~ 
(red): the arms of the Ubriachi of Florence. 

	|64.~  A sow in brood ^azure~ in ^argent~: the arms of 
the Scrovigni of Padua. 

	|68.~  Of Vitaliano, the only one of the usurers 
mentioned by name, we have no certain information. 

	|73.~  Three bucks were the arms of the Becchi family of 
Florence.  It is thought that the `sovereign knight' of usurers 
is Gianni Buiamonte, who was of some prominence in the second 
half of the 13th century.  He belonged to a money-lending 
company.  In 1297 or 1298 he was made Cavaliere.  By 1308, 
however, he was bankrupt and a fugitive from justice.  He 
compounded with his creditors, and died in 1310.  See M. Barbi in
^Stud. dant.~, X, 55.

mouth and draw out the tongue?'

	|85.  Riprezzo~, `chill.' 

	|87.~  `And is all of a shiver when he so much as looks

than `exhortations.' 

	|95.  Forse~, `doubt,' `peril.' 

	|102.  A gioco~, `at large.' 

	|107.~  Phaeton, son of Phoebus, was carried away by the 
horses of the chariot of the sun, which he tried to drive: 
^Met.~, II, 150 ff., especially l. 200: 

     `Mentis inops gelida formidine lora remisit.' 

	|108.~  The sky, scorched by the runaway chariot, still 
shows traces of it in the Milky Way.  See ^Conv.~, II, xv, 44-55.

	|109.~  Daedalus, to escape from Crete, fashioned wings for
his son Icarus and himself and fastened them on with wax.  In
spite of his father's warning, the boy flew so high that the sun
melted the wax, and, losing his wings, he fell into the sea.  See
^Met.~, VIII, 183 ff. 

	|118.  Gorgo~, `rapids': the water of Phlegethon, at the 
foot of the cataract.
