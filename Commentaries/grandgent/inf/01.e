	|Proemio.~ THIS canto, which serves as a general introduction to the
poem, is more formal in its allegory than those which follow;
it
affords, in some measure, a key to the whole interpretation. 
This announcement and summary of the whole ^Commedia~ may be
compared to the opening lines of the ^Aeneid~, the
^Pharsalia~,
and the ^Thebaid.~  The author has purposely enveloped its
incidents in a veil of mystery, which enhances its
impressiveness.

	It is the night of April 7, the night before Good Friday
in the great jubilee year 1300.  Dante, at the age of thirty-
five, suddenly becomes aware that he is astray in the dark
wood
of worldiness.  In terror he seeks refuge at the foot of the
mountain of rectitude, whose summit is lit by the rising sun. 
The sun, here and elsewhere, typifies enlightenment, perhaps
more
specifically, as Flamini suggests, righteous choice, the
intelligent use of the free will.  When Dante tries to scale
the
hill, three beasts beset his path, a leopard, a lion, and a
wolf
-- the same creatures that appear in Jer. v, 6: 'Wherefore a
lion
out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings
shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities:
every
one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces.' 
Apparently
he has a fair prospect of passing the first two, at least the
leopard, but the wolf drives him back.  These animals
evidently
stand for Dante's vicious habits, which prevent his reform. 
The
old commentators interpreted them respectively as luxury,
pride,
and avarice; this would imply (unless we understand the poet's
whole experience to be generic, not individual) that Dante's
dominant sin was avarice, which is scarcely believable.  A
modern
view, upheld by Flamini, is, in spite of some grave objections
far more satisfactory in itself and more in harmony with the
whole structure of the poem.  Inasmuch as the sins of Hell
fall
under the three heads, Incontinence, Violence, and Fraud, it
is
natural that the beasts should stand for corresponding
practices:
the ravening wolf is Incontinence of any kind, the raging lion
is
Violence, the swift and stealthy leopard is Fraud.  St. Thomas
and Richard of St. Victor, two of Dante's favorite authors,
saw
in the spotted pard a fit symbol of fraudulence.  We may
understand, then, from the episode, that Dante could perhaps
have
overcome the graver sins of Fraud and Violence, but was
unable,
without heavenly aid to rid himself of some of the habits of
Incontinence.

	At this crisis Reason, personified in Virgil, comes at
divine bidding, to the sinner's rescue.  He declares that
escape
is possible only by another route, which will lead them
through
Hell: we cannot run away from evil before we know what it
really
is; a rational understanding of human wickedness must precede
reformation.  The wolf, he says, is ravaging the world, and
will
continue to do so until a Hound shall appear and drive it back
into Hell, whence it first came.  This Hound is obviously a
redeemer who shall set the world aright.  If we compare this
passage with another prophecy in ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 40-45, it is
tolerably clear that he is to be a temporal rather than a
spiritual saviour -- a great Emperor whose mission it shall be
to
establish the balance of power, restore justice, and guide
erring
humanity.  Such an Emperor, destined to come at the end of the
world, was not unknown to legend; his advent appears to have
been
sometimes associated with the ^annus canicularis~, the period
of
Sirius, the Dog Star.  As the prediction was still unfulfilled
at
the time of writing, Dante naturally made it vague; in fact,
he
rendered Delphic obscurity doubly obscure by adding the
mysterious words 'tra Feltro e Feltro.'  We know that the poet
entertained great hopes of the youthful leader, Can Grande
della
Scala, in Dante's last years the chief representative of the
Imperial power in Italy.  It is possible that he so
constructed
his prognostication as to make its application to Can Grande
evident in case those hopes should be realized, but not
obtrusive
in case they were not.  'Veltro' easily suggests Can Grande;
'Feltro e Feltro' may point to the towns of Feltre and Monte
Feltro.  Dante's conception of the just Emperor was perhaps
influenced by current stories of the Grand Khan of Tartary,
who
was said to despise wealth and to live simply in a 'felt'
tent,
and whose title had a strange likeness to the name of the
Imperial Vicar General.

	For the allegory of the beasts, see Flamini, II, 115 ff.
For the Veltro: V. Cian, ^Sulle orme del Veltro~, 1897; A.
Bassermann, ^Veltro, Gross-Chan und Kaisersage~, 1902, and
also
^Studien zur vergleichenden Literaturgeschichte~, VIII, 5
(where
Bassermann points out a strange similarity between Dante's
phraseology and that of a passage in the Alexandrian Greek
prophecies called ^Oracula Sibyllina~).  The interpretation
and
the coinage of prophecy had a great vogue in the 13th and 14th
centuries; A. Scolari, ^Il Messia dantesco~, 1913 (cf.
^Bull.~,
XX, 89); G. Fregni, ^Sul veltro allegorico di Dante~, 1913; H.
Matrod, ^Le Veltro de Dante et son DXV Khan et Can (Extrait
des
$Etudes Franciscaines~), 1913: the Veltro was suggested by the
Grand Khan of Tartary, whose title seems to be identical with
^Cane~ or with ^Can Grande~; the Tartars were swift as hounds,
they lived in felt tents, they used no money, and they lifted
their Emperor to the throne on a piece of felt.  In the second
half of the 13th century, Europeans generally believed that
the
Tartars had become Christians, and there were tales of a great
Christian Emperor and Empress of Tartary; about 1300, indeed,
there was a widely circulated report that the Tartars had
taken
Jerusalem to restore it to the Christians.  These stories
combined with the old belief in a great Emperor to come at the
end of the world; and with the idea of the year of the Dog
Star,
Sirius.

	|1.~  In the ^Convivio~, IV, xxiv, 30-1, Dante says that `il
colmo del nostro arco @e nelli trentacinque.'  Cf. Ps. xc (Vulg.
lxxxix), 10: `The days of our years are threescore years and
ten.'  Compare also ^Thebaid~, I, 390-391:

     `Medio de limite vitae
     En senium vergens.'

It is the story of Akustur, which is told in ^Conv.~ IV, xxv: see
W. P. Mustard, in ^Modern Language Notes~, XXXIX, 120.

	|2.  Mi ritrovai~, `I came to my senses.'  For the situation
in the opening lines, cf. B. Latini, ^Tesoretto~, II, 75-78, and
III, 1.

	|4.~  Many mss. have as the opening word ^E, Ehi~ or ^Ahi~,
all equivalent; some have ^era cosa.~  See G. Vandelli in ^Studi
danteschi~, IV, 39.  Guido Colonna, in his poem ^Amor che
lungiamente m' a menato~ has a line:

     `Ahi quanto @e dura cosa al cor dolente.'

	|7.  Amara~ presumably refers to ^cosa~ in l. 4. -- Cf.
Ecclus. xli, 1: `O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee!'
Cf. also Ecclus. vii, 27; `amariorem morte.'

	|11.~  According to St. Augustine, `The soul's sleep is
forgetfulness of God': Flam., II, 204.

	|16.~  Cf. Ps. cxxi (Vulg. cxx), 1: `I will lift up mine
eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.'

	|17.  Pianeta~, the sun, which is just rising.  It is the
morning of Good Friday, April 8, 1300.

	|21.  Con tanta pieta~, `so piteously.'  ^Pieta~, beside
^piet@a~, was not uncommon in early Italian.  It means
`piteousness' rather than `pity' or `piety.'

	|24.~  Apparently Dante, like Petrarch, preferred not to
double the ^l~ of the definite article compounded with a
preposition.  Was this merely a matter of spelling, or did it
indicate the pronunciation?

	|28.  Ei~, an old form equivalent to ^ebbi~, is still kept
as an ending in the first person singular of the conditional.

	|30.  Fermo~, `still.'  This perplexing and much discussed
line seems to describe the act of cautiously feeling one's way up
a slope (|piaggia~).  See, however, F. Flamini in ^Giorn. dant.~,
X, 145; also D. Guerri in ^Giorn. dant.~, XIII, 177; and
d'Ovidio+3~, 447.

	|32.  Lonza~ is etymologically connected with ^ounce~ and
perhaps with ^lynx.~ The animal portrayed, however, is evidently
the leopardess, which Dante probably regarded as identical with
the panther; it appears, in fact, that the panther, in Dante's
day, was thought to be the female of the leopard (cf. ^Giorn.
dant.~, XV, 1).  See K. McKenzie, ^The Problem of the Lonza~, in
^Romanic Review~, I, 18.  Cf. J. Camus in ^Giorn. stor.~, LIII,
1.  According to A. Levi, in ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIV, 190, ^lonza~
is the same as French ^once~ (English `ounce'), which meant
`hunting leopard.'

	|36.  Volte volto~: the repetition of sound, here as in
some other passages, is obviously intentional.  It is possible
that in this line Dante meant to suggest wearisome iteration --
`I turned again and again and again.' -- See F. Cipolla,
^Risuonanze nella Divina Commedia~, in ^Atti del Reale Istituto
Veneto~, LX, ii, 31.

	|38.~  The sun was in the constellation of Aries, the Ram.

	|40.~  It was believed that when the universe was created,
the heavenly bodies were placed in their vernal positions.  The
sun is in the sign of Aries from March 21 to April 20 inclusive.

	|41.~  Construe: `S@i che l' ora del tempo e la dolce
stagione m' era (= erano) cagione a bene sperar di quella fera
alla gaetta pelle.'

	|42.~  Cf. Ovid, ^Met.~, III, 669: `Pictarumque jacent fera
corpora pantherarum.'

	|46.  Venesse~ for ^venisse.~  Cf. Cecco Angiolieri da
Siena, who in ^Se si Potesse~, rimes ^sentisse~, ^compiesse~, and
^venisse.~

	|48.~  Cf. Ovid, ^Met.~, XIII, 406: `Externasque novo
latratu terruit auras.'

	|52.~  It was believed that when a wolf meets a man, and
sees him first, he strikes the man dumb.  See R. T. Holbrook,
^Dante and the Animal Kingdom~, 1902, p. 116.

	|60.~  For this transference of sense notation, cf.
^Inf.~ V, 28.

	|63.  Fioco~ in Dante seems always to mean `weak.'  The
voice of Reason has not been heeded for so long that it comes
faintly to the sinner's ear; so the figure of Virgil appears
dim. Cf. Verlaine, ^Sagesse~, v:

     `La voix vous fut connue (et ch@ere?)
     Mais @a pr$esent elle est voil$ee.'

See Flam., II, 209; also Moore, I, 181.

	|65.  Miserere~, `have mercy upon me': beginning of Ps. li
(Vulg. l).

	|70.  Sub Iulio~, at the time of Julius Caesar. -- |Tardi~,
so late that I was idenified with the reign of Augustus, and not
that of Caesar.  Virgil was barely twenty-six when Caesar
perished.

	|72.~  Repeatedly Virgil makes pathetic but always dignified
and reticent allusion to his lack of Christianity and his
consequent eternal exclusion from the presence of God.  Dante
seems to have discarded the forms of the article and the
demonstrative containing palatal ^l.~

	|73.~  ^Aen.~, I, 544-5:

     `Rex erat Aeneas nobis, quo justior alter,
     Nec pietate fuit, nec bello major et armis.'

	|75.~  ^Aen.~, III, 2-3: `Ceciditque superbum Ilium.'
^Met.~, XIII, 108: `Ilion ardebat.'

	|84.~  We learn from ^Inf.~ XX, 114 that Dante knew the
^Aeneid~ by heart.

	|85.~  ^Conv.~, IV, vi, 43-5: ^`Autore...~ si prende per
ogni persona degna d' essere creduta e obbedita.'

	|87.  Lo bello stilo~, especially the choice of elegant
words, an art to be learned by the study of good models.  See
^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, II, iv and vi.  Cf. G. Lisio, ^Lo
"bello stile" nelle "Rime" e nella "Commedia~," in ^Rivista
d'Italia~, VII, ii, 349; C. H. Grandgent, ^Lo bello stilo~, in
^Todd
Memorial Volumes~, 1930, I, 171.

	|89.  Saggio~, in Dante, is almost equivalent to ^poeta.~

	|90.  Le vene e i polsi~ was a standing phrase.  Cf.
^Inf.~ XIII, 63.

	|100.~  Rev. xviii, 3: `For all nations have drunk of the
wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth
have committed fornication with her.'

	|103.  Peltro~, `pewter,' i.e., money.  It was a common
belief that wolves eat dirt.  We read in the ^Tesoretto~ of
Brunetto Latini:

     `Che tutta la sembianza
     D'Alessandro tenete,
     Che par neente temete
     Terra, oro e ariento.'

See ^Bull.~, XX, 96.  Cf. A. Solmi, ^Sulla traccia del Veltro~,
in ^Rivista d'Italia~, March 15, 1913; reviewed by V. Cian in
^Bull.~, XX, 81.  For additional explanations, see ^Studi
danteschi~, IV, 85, and ^Zeitschrift f,ur romanische Philologie~,
XLIII, 318.

	|105.~  This line is intentionally obscure.  |Nazion~
probably means `birth.'  |Feltro~ means `felt.'  |Feltro~
suggests the towns of Feltre and Montefeltro.  In a Romagnole
prophecy of about 1270, ^feltro~, ^veltro~, and ^peltro~ occur
together: ^Bull.~, XXI, 2.

	|106.~  ^Aen.~, III, 522-3: `Humilemque videmus Italiam.'
Virgil meant `lowlying,' but Dante took the word in a moral
sense.

	|107.~  Camilla, a warrior virgin who fought against the
Trojans: ^Aen.~, XI.

	|108.~  ^Aen.~, IX, XII.  |Ferute~ for ^ferite.~

	|111.  Dipartilla~ = ^la dipart@i.~  Cf. Wisdom ii, 24:
`through envy of the devil came death into the world.'

	|112.  Me'~ = ^meglio.~

	|113.  Segui~ = ^segua.~

	|117.~  `Each of whom proclaims the second death,' i.e.,
damnation.  The phrase was often used in this sense by
theologians.  Cf. Rev. xxi, 8: `the lake which burneth with fire
and brimstone: which is the second death'; also Rev. xx, 14.  Cf.
Dante, Epistola VI, ii, 26 ff.: `Vos autem divina iura et humana
transgredientes..., nonne terror secundae mortis exagitat...?'

	|118.~  The souls in Purgatory.

	|122.~  Beatrice.

	|126.  Che... per me si vegna~ = ^che io venga.~  This
curious passive impersonal construction occurs several times,
with verbs of coming, going, and staying, in Dante's works:
^Inf.~ XXVI, 18; ^Purg.~ XVI, 119-20, XXII, 85, XXV, 109-10;
^Conv.~, III, xiii, 95-7.

	|134.~  The gate of Purgatory, opened only to the elect.
