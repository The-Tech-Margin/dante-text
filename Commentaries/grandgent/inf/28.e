	|Proemio.~ AN involved simile, at the beginning of this canto, calls
up the picture of a vast accumulation of maimed bodies
gathered
through the centuries, from the many battlefields of southern
Italy.  Even this mangled host conveys but a faint idea of the
ninth ^bolgia.~  Creators of strife are here hacked by the
sword
of a fiend, as they pass by; their horribly dissevered state
represents the life of bloodshed and dissension which they
loved. 
Conspicuous among them are Mahomet, the Roman Curio, Mosca de'
Lamberti of Florence and the Proven$cal warrior-poet Bertran
de
Born.

	Some of Dante's contemporaries believed Mahomet to have
been originally not only a Christian, but a cardinal and an
aspirant to the papacy;.  The poet, then, was justified in
regarding him and his son-in-law Ali as the leaders of a great
schism in the Christian Church.

	The tribune Curio, banished from Rome, fled to Caesar
who was hesitating on the bank of the Rubicon, and 'sunk the
doubt' within him by urging him to march on the capital.  The
event is narrated by Lucan in ^Pharsalia~, I, 266 ff.  He now
wishes he had never seen Rimini, near which town the Rubicon
empties into the Adriatic.

	In 1215 a Buondelmonte, who was betrothed to a lady of
the Amidei family, was induced to jilt her and appear on his
wedding day with a bride from the house of the Donati.  The
Amidei came together to discuss the best way to avenge this
affront.  Some advised inflicting on Buondelmonte a beating or
a
wound in the face.  Mosca, however, affirmed that such an
attack
would result in more harm to the aggressors than to the
victim. 
'Cosa fatta capo ha,' he declared -- 'a thing once done has an
end': if we do him a hurt, let it be a final one.  The Amidei
followed his counsel and murdered the offender.  Hence arose
the
feud between the families and, according to local tradition,
the
first conflict between Guelfs and Ghibellines in Florence. 
The
Lamberti, to whom Mosca belonged, were afterwards banished
from
the city and never allowed to return.

	Bertran de Born was a Proven$cal poet of the latter part
of the 12th century.  To further his private ends, he took
advantage of the disputes and wars of Henry II of England and
his
two elder sons, Henry and Richard, who had extensive
possessions
in southern France.  According to his old Proven$cal
biography,
which considerably exaggerates his political importance,
Bertran
was active in fomenting their quarrels, and formed a close
friendship with the younger Henry.  This prince was crowned in
his father's lifetime, and was consequently known as 'the
young
English king.'  His early death in 1183 was mourned by Bertran
in
verse that gained wide renown.

	Curio is mentioned in one of Dante's letters, Ep. VII.

	For Bertran, see Hayden Boyers, ^Cleavage in Bertran de
Born and Dante~, in ^Modern Philology~, XXIV, 1; J. L.
Perrier,
^Bertran de Born, Patriot, and his Place in Dante's Inferno~,
in ^Romanic Review~, XI, 223.

	The story of Mahomet as Cardinal is found in the ^Chiose
anonime all'Inferno~, written about the time of Dante's death
and published in 1865 and 1900.  It occurs also in the Old
French
^Penart le Contrefait~, Part II, of the first half of the 14th
century: Vincent de Beauvais, ^Speculum Historiale~, Lib.
XXII,
Cap. 51, regards Mahomet as a Christian and a schismatic but
not
a Cardinal.  So does the ^Ottimo Commento.~  See J. S. P.
Tatlock, ^Mohammed and his Followers~ in ^Dante~, in ^Modern
Language Review~, XXVII, 186.

	|1.  Con parole sciolte~: in prose. 

	|2.  A pieno~, `in full.' 

	|3.  Per narrar~, `though he should narrate.' 

	|4.  Verria meno~, `would fall short.' 

	|5.  Per~, `by reason of.'  |Sermone~, `speech': cf. XIII,
21.  |Mente~, `memory': cf. II, 6. 

	|6.  Comprender~, `hold.'  |Seno~, `hollow,' i.e., 
capacity. 

	|7.~  The |el~ is redundant: it anticipates the real
subject, |gente.~  In this involved passage, |s' aunasse~ is to 
be connected with ^quella~ (^gente~) in l. 13 and ^l' altra~ 
(^gente~) in l. 15.  The conclusion is reached in ll. 20-1. 

	|8.  Fortunata~,  `stormy.' 

	|9.~  The name Apulia was often given to all the 
continental part of the Kingdom of Naples. 

	|10.  Per li Troiani~, `on account of the Trojans,' i.e., 
the Romans, whose ancestors came from Troy: the allusion is to 
the conquest of the Samnites by the Romans, perhaps also to the 
defeat of Pyrrhus.  The `long war' is the Second Punic War, led 
by Hannibal against Rome.  Livy in XXV, xii, records an old 
prophecy: `Amnem Trojugena Cannam Romane fuge.' 

	|11.~  It was said that after the battle of Cannae
Hannibal's troops took from the dead Romans more than three 
bushels of rings -- or (the `unerring Livy' adds, XXXIII, 12), 
according to a report nearer the truth, about one bushel.  Cf. 
^Conv.~, IV, v, 164-71.  |A nella~, plural of ^anello.~ 

	|14.  Per contastare~ = ^contrastare~, `through opposing' 
Robert Guiscard, the Norman conqueror who overran southern Italy
in the 11th century, and became Duke of Apulia. 

	|15.~  Those slain in the battle of Benevento, in 1266,
where Manfred, son of Frederick II, was defeated by Charles of 
Anjou, and killed.  In reality there was no fight at Ceprano; the
first encounter was at S. Germano.  Dante apparently followed, 
with several chroniclers, a false report.  Manfred was deserted 
by the Apulian troops at Benevento; but the Apulian reputation 
for inconstancy antedates the battle.  Giacomino Pugliese, before
this, had conspired against Frederick II.  Cf. E. Pozzi in 
^Giorn. stor.~, LVII, 303. 

	|17.  Da~, `by.'  At Tagliacozzo, in 1268, the Imperial 
forces were again defeated by Charles of Anjou, and Conradin, 
nephew of Manfred and grandson of Frederick, was captured.  The 
victory was due to the strategy of an elderly French General, 
$Erard de Val$ery; he won by his wit rather than by his sword. 

	|19.  Qual...Qual~, `one...another.'  |Membro~ is the 
object of |mostrasse~.  |Mozzo~, `severed.' 

	|20.  Aequar~, `compare.'  Cf. ^Aen.~, II, 362. 

	|22.  Veggia~, `cask.'  |Mezzul~, `mid-board': the middle
one of the three pieces that compose the bottom of a cask. 
|Lulla~ (half-moon), `side-piece.' 

	|23.~  The construction is made clear by transposing the two
halves of this line. 

	|24.~  Cleft from chin to anus. 

	|25.  Minugia~, `entrails.' 

	|26.  Corata~, `pluck.'  |Sacco~: the stomach. 

	|27.  Si trangugia~, `is swallowed.' 

	|30.  Dilacco~, `split.' 

	|32.  Al@i~, `Ali': the husband of Mahomet's favorite 
daughter, and one of his most zealous followers. -- Ll. 32, 34, 
36 are ^versi tronchi~: see IV, 56. 

	|33.  Ciuffetto~, `forelock.' 

	|35.~  For ^scandalo~ and ^scisma~, see F. Torraca, ^Nuovi 
studi danteschi~, 226. 

	|37.  Accisma~, `fashions': cf. Old French ^acesmer~, 
`arrange.'  ^Accesma~ is common; the ^i~ of ^accisma~ is from the
forms in which the accent is on the next syllable. 

	|39.  Risma~, `lot.' 

	|42.  Altri~, `one.' 

	|43.  Muse~, `dalliest': cf. V, 19. 

	|45.~  `Thine own indictment': cf. V, 8. 

	|54.  Martiro~ = ^martirio.~ 

	|55.  S' armi~, `provide himself,' is to be connected with
^di vivanda~ in l. 58.  Fra Dolcino, as he was generally called
(though not a friar), became the leader of the heretical sect
called the Apostolic Brethren, whose aim was to bring the Church
and mankind back to a state of primitive simplicity.  He made
many converts in northern Italy.  A crusade having been
proclaimed against him by Clement V, he took refuge, in the 
winter of 1306, in the stronghold of Zebello, where he was 
besieged for three months and finally taken, after three days' 
fighting.  He was put to death in Novara.  According to Dante's 
version, he was obliged by snow and famine to surrender. 

	|58.  Stretta~, `block.' 

	|59.  Al Noarese~, `to the Novarese,' the people of 
Novara. 

	|61.~  Mahomet is so eager to give this warning that he 
speaks while his foot is partly uplifted to depart.  See F. d' 
Ovidio in ^Stud. dant.~, VII, 21 (Mahomet's foot rests on the 
toes, the heel being off the ground). 

	|66.  Mai~ = ^pi@u.~ 

	|68.  Canna~, `gullet': cf. VI, 27. 

	|73.~  Of this acquaintance of the poet, nothing is 
known.  Medicina is a little town near Bologna.  The ^dolce 
piano~ is the plain of the Po, sloping from Vercelli to the 
stronghold of Marcab@o, near Ravenna.  See ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIV,
8; ^Nuovo Giornale dantesco~, II, 29. 

	|77.~  Guido del Cassero and Agnolello di Carignano 
belonged to opposing factions in the town of Fano; almost nothing
else is known of them, nor have we any other information about 
the crime here predicted.  The date is put conjecturally at 1312:
see Parodi, 373. 

	|79.  Vasello~, bark. 

	|80.  Mazzerati~, `drowned.'  ^Mazzera~ means a bunch of 
stones fastened to a tunny net.  |Cattolica~: a place on the 
Adriatic between Rimini and Pesaro.  Ll. 80, 82, 84 are ^versi 
sdruccioli~: see XV, 1. 

	|82.  Cipri~, `Cyprus.'  |Maiolica~, `Majorca.'  From one 
end of the Mediterranean to the other. 

	|84.  Gente Argolica~ (^Aen.~, II, 78), `Argolic 
people,' i.e., Greeks, famous of old as sea robbers. 

	|85.  Uno~, supply here ^occhio~: Malatestino (XXVII, 46) 
had only one eye. 

	|86.  Terra~: Rimini.  |Tal~: Curio (cf. l. 102). 

	|87.~  Wishes he had never seen: cf. XVIII, 42. 

	|88.  Parlamento~, `parley.' 

	|90.~  They need offer no vow nor prayer to the wind of 
Focara, i.e., they need have no fear of being shipwrecked, 
because they will be already drowned.  The squalls which blew 
from Focara (near `la Cattolica') were dangerous to sailors. 

	|93.~  That is, the one who wishes he had never seen 
Rimini: cf. l. 87. 

	|98.~  `The man prepared has always lost by delay (endured
waiting to his loss)' is a paraphrase of the words of Curio in
^Phars.~, I, 281: `semper nocuit differre paratis.' 

	|100.  Sbigottito~, `aghast.' 

	|101.  Strozza~, `throat.' 

	|104.  Moncherin~, `stumps.' 

	|112.  Stuolo~: cf. XIV, 32. 

	|116.~  `That good companion that emboldens a man.' 

	|117.~  `Under the hauberk of conscious purity.' 

	|122.  Pesol~, `dangling.' 

	|126.  Governa~, `ordains.' 

	|128.  Con tutta la testa~, `head and all': cf. XXII, 
147. 

	|132.~  Cf. Lamentations i, 12: `behold, and see if there 
be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.' 

	|135.  Ma'~ = ^mali~: `the wicked encouragement.'  The 
great weight of manuscript evidence is in favor of the reading 
^re Giovanni~, instead of |re giovane~, and it must be confessed
that ^Giovanni~ makes a much smoother line.  But Bertran's 
relations were with Henry II and his oldest son, also named 
Henry, and commonly called `the young king'; he had dealings also
with Richard (afterwards Richard I), but none with John 
(subsequently King John).  Either Dante or his first copyists 
must have made a blunder: inasmuch as there is every reason to 
believe that Dante was familiar with Bertran's poems and the 
Proven$cal biography of him, we may confidently ascribe the 
mistake to the copyists.  At that time ^giovane~ and ^Giovanni~ 
might be spelled exactly alike.  In the north Italian versions of
the story the young king is referred to as `Roi Johans.' 

	|138.  Malvagi punzelli~, `evil instigations.'  For the 
story of Absalom and Ahithophel, see 2 Samuel xiv-xviii. 

	|141.~  The `source' of the brain is the spinal column. 
|Troncone~, `trunk.' 

	|142.  Contrapasso~, `retribution': the law of retaliation,
according to which the penalties are meted out in Hell.  Cf.
Exod. xxi, 24; Levit. xxiv, 20; Deut. xix, 21; Mat. v, 38.
