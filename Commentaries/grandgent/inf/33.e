	|Proemio.~ IN this canto occurs an episode second only to that of
Francesca da Rimini in its appeal to popular sympathy.  It is
in
Antenora that Dante hears from Count Ugolino the frightful
story
of his death.  Here, as in the case of the 'injured souls' of
Francesca
and her lover, the poet is stirred to the depths by the wrong
done on earth to the lost sinner.  Francesca's fate moves him
to
an agony of pity not unmixed with indignation; that of Ugolino
and his children kindles in him even more wrath than
compassion. 
In the two narratives we find the same exclusion of all detail
that might blur the one overwhelming impression to be produced
upon the reader; in both, the same concentration on that part
of
the experience to which no human heart can be indifferent.  As
Francesca's guilty love follows her to Hell and binds her
forever
to the partner of her sin, so Ugolino is coupIed to the object
of
his just hate, on whom he wreaks eternal vengeance.

	Ugolino della Gherardesca, count of Donoratico, belonged
to an old and powerful family and held vast estates in western
Tuscany.  Inasmuch as he was vicar, in Sardinia, of King Enzo
(son of Frederick II) and married his eldest son to Enzo's
daughter, he must have been originally of the Imperial
faction;
but as early as 1275 he for some reason allied himself to the
Tuscan Guelfs against Pisa, which was then Ghibelline.  It was
doubtless for this political treason that Dante condemned him
to
Antenora.  His party was successful, and he secured
readmission
to the city.  In fact, after 1284 he governed Pisa for the
Guelfs, at first alone, later in company with his grandson,
Nino
Visconti, who appears in ^Purg.~ VIII, 53.  But the Pisan
Ghibellines, led by the turbulent and intriguing Archbishop
Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, -- who in 1288 plotted to surrender
his
city to the Genoese, and then broke faith with them, --
revolted
in that same year against the Guelf control.  Ugolino was
absent
at the time, and Nino was driven from the town.  In June
Ugolino
was invited to confer with the Ghibelline leaders.  He
returned
to Pisa and held parley with the archbishop.  Suddenly an
alarm
was given, and the Ghibellines, with a frenzied mob led by
Ruggieri, attacked their opponents, whom they finally besieged
in
the city hall and, after severe fighting, captured.  Ugolino
was
incarcerated with two of his sons, Gaddo and Uguccione, and
two
grandsons, Ugolino or Nino (called 'il Brigata ') and
Anselmuccio
the children of Guelfo, his firstborn.  After some months the
door of their jail was nailed up, and they were left to
starve. 
When their bodies were taken out, several days after their
death,
they were found to be badly rat-bitten; and a couple of old
chroniclers declare that the unfortunate prisoners had eaten
one
another's flesh, or, more specifically, their hands and arms. 
It
was perhaps a desire to explain the mutilation in a more
fitting
way that led Dante to conceive of Ugolino, in his intolerable
anguish, as gnawing his own hands.  Nevertheless some modern
commentators have imagined that Dante intended, in the last
verse
of Ugolino's speech, to imply that the bereaved father was
driven
to cannibalism.

	Treachery to a traitor was thought to be not only
permissible, but meritorious; and this belief is illustrated
by
Dante's treatment of one of the wretches in Tolomea.  To be
rude
to him, he avers, was the part of true courtesy.  In this
division of the ninth circle are those who assassinated their
own
guests.  Such betrayal as this severs all social bonds and
puts
the betrayer outside the pale of humanity.  Dante expresses
this
idea allegorically by a startling device, which at the same
time
enables him to place in his lower world two or three heinous
offenders still alive in 1300.  As soon as this crime is
committed, -- so we are informed, -- the sinner's soul
descends
to Hell, leaving the body, which, however, seems to remain
alive,
being occupied by a devil during the remainder of its natural
term of existence.  Thus it is written of Judas, at the Last
Supper: 'after the sop Satan entered into him' (John xiii,
27). 
In Ps. lv, 15 it is said of treacherous friends, 'let them
descend quick (i.e., alive) into hell.'

	|21.  Offeso~, `wronged': cf. V, 102, 109. 

	|22.  Muda~, `mew': a loft where birds are kept while they
moult.  Ugolino gives this name to the tower of the Gualandi da
Sette Vie, where he was confined.  After his death it was called
`la torre della fame,' which name is now given to the relatively
modern tower which occupies its site. 

	|24.~  It was not until 1318 that the municipal authorities
decided to discontinue the use of this prison, which was
described as foul-smelling, devoid of conveniences, and very
small. 

	|26.~  Several moons had appeared through the cleft of the
little slit that served as a window: i.e., several months had
passed -- from July 20, or thereabouts, to the beginning of
February, 1288-9.  Just before dawn of the day when the door is 
to be nailed up, Ugolino has an allegorical dream; from ll. 38-9
we learn that his companions have ominous dreams, but of a more 
literal character. 

	|28.  Questi~: Ruggieri.  |Donno~, `lord': master of the 
hunt. 

	|30.~  The mountain which prevents the Pisans from seeing 
Lucca is San Giuliano, a long flat mountain conspicuous from the
Leaning Tower. 

	|31.~  The `thin, eager, trained hounds' evidently represent
the furious Pisan mob. 

	|32.~  The leaders of the Pisan Ghibellines; in the dream 
they figure as huntsmen. 

	|35.  Scane~, or ^scanne~, `fangs.' 

	|46.  Chiavar~, `nail': cf. ^Purg.~ VIII, 137; ^Par.~ 
XIX, 105. 

	|49.  Impetrai~, `I turned to stone.' 

	|50.  Anselmuccio~: the younger of the two grandchildren. 

	|59.  Fessi~ = ^facessi.~ 

	|60.  Manicar~ = ^mangiare~: cf. ^Vulg. El.~, I, xiii, 
19.  |Levorsi~ = ^si levarono.~ 

	|75.~  Hunger did more than grief could do: it caused my 
death.  Cf. d' Ovidio+3~, 63. 

	|79.~  For the imprecation, cf. ^Phars.~, VIII, 827-30; E.
G. Gardner in ^Modern Language Review~, XVIII, 120. 

	|80.~  Dante, like some others, classified the languages of
Europe according to the word for `yes,' Italian being the
language of ^s@i~: cf. ^Vulg. El.~, I, 53-7.  Proven$cal was 
called the ^langue d'oc.~ 

	|81.  I vicini~: Lucca and Florence, which waged bitter 
war against Pisa. 

	|82.~  Two small islands in the sea not far from the mouth
of the Arno, beside which Pisa lies.  Dante calls upon these
islets to move up and dam the stream at its outlet.  Gorgona is
visible from The Leaning Tower.  Capraia, sometimes called
^Caprara~, is further out. 

	|85.  Aveva voce~ `was reported.'  The archbishop
represented to the Pisans that Ugolino in 1285, had betrayed them
in the matter of five strongholds which he had allowed Lucca and
Florence to occupy.  In reality the cession of these castles was
a necessary piece of diplomacy. 

	|87.  Dovei~ = ^dovevi.~ 

	|88.~  The subject of |facea~ is |et@a~ (`their youthful 
age'); the objects are ^Uguiccione, Brigata~, and ^li altri due~
(Anselmuccio and Gaddo).  Gaddo and Uguccione were Ugolino's 
sons, Brigata and Anselmuccio his grandsons.  Gaddo and Brigata 
were in reality of mature age. 

	|89.~  Thebes being the wickedest city of the ancients, 
Dante calls Pisa the `modern Thebes.'  The repetition of 
|novella~ must be intentional; it accentuates the contrast 
between the innocence of youth and the hoary iniquity of Pisa. 

	|91.  Gelata~, `ice.' 

	|93.~  Not turned face downward, like those in Caina, but 
all upturned. 

	|95.  Rintoppo~, `hindrance.' 

	|96.  Ambascia~, `anguish.' 

	|97.  Groppo~, `knot,' i.e., a solid block of ice.

	|100.  Avvegna che~, `although.'  |D' un~ = ^da un.~ 

	|102.  Cessato...stallo~, `ended its stay,' i.e., 
departed.  |Del~ = ^dal.~ 

	|105.~  Wind is a `dry vapor': cf. ^Conv.~, I, iv, 36. 

	|106.  Avaccio~, `quickly.' 

	|108.  Che 'l fiato piove~, `which rains down (produces) the
blast.' 

	|111.~  This spirit thinks that Dante and Virgil must be
going to Giudecca. 

	|113.  Impregna~, `swells.' 

	|116.  Disbrigo~, `rid.' 

	|117.~  This oath seems to be uttered with false intent, as
Dante's way lies, in any case, through `the bottom of the ice.' 

	|118.~  Alberigo de' Manfredi of Faenza, a ^frate gaudente~,
had two of his family murdered at a dinner, in his presence, in
1285.  He gave the signal to the assassins by calling: `Vengano
le frutta!' 

	|120.  Riprendo dattero per figo~, `am being repaid with 
interest,' a date being worth more than a fig. 

	|121.  Ancor~ = ^gi@a.~ 

	|122.  Stea~ = ^stia.~ 

	|126.~  `Before Atropos (the Fate who cuts the thread of
life) gives it a start.  |Dea~ = ^dia.~ 

	|127.  Rade~ = ^rada.~ 

	|134.  Suso~: on earth. 

	|135.  Verna~, `is wintering.' 

	|136.  Dei~ = ^devi.~ -- |Pur mo~, `only now.' 

	|137.~  Branca d' Oria, of the famous Genoese family of
Doria, was a rich and powerful noble of Genoa, who had great 
estates in Liguria, Corsica, and Sardinia.  Apparently he lived 
until 1325.  Aided by a relative not known to us by name, he 
murdered, probably in 1275, his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, the
Sardinian barrator whom we met in `the sticky pitch' of the 8th 
ditch of Malebolge (XXII, 88). 

	|140.  Unquanche~, `as yet.' 

	|141.~  Cf. ^Measure for Measure~, III, ii: `I drink, I eat,
array myself, and live.' 

	|145.~  Branca's soul, leaving a devil in its stead, reached
this 9th circle as soon as the murdered man's soul reached the
8th. 

	|146.  Ed un suo prossimano~, `and so did a relative of
his.' 

	|150.~  `And it was courtesy to be rude to him.' 

	|151.  Diversi d' ogne costume~, `strange to all morality.' 

	|152.  Magagna~, `corruption,' lit. `blemish.' 

	|153.  Spersi~ = ^dispersi.~ 

	|154.~  Alberigo de' Manfredi. 

	|155.~  Branca d' Oria.
