	|Proemio.~ THE manifold crimes of the Lower Hell are due to pride
and envy, and these sins are personified in Satan and the
giants.
Embedded in the central point of his kingdom, the arch-sinner,
surrounded by a ring of fellow-rebels, holds his eternal
court. 
The spirits that thought to rise so high are sunken at the
bottom
of the universe; their monstrous forms are fixed and impotent
forevermore.  This rather than the Circle of Violence, is
artistically their fit place; and here, no doubt, Dante would
have put them, even if Virgil had not pointed the way (^Aen.~,
VI, 580-1):

     'Hic genus antiquum terrae, Titania pubes,
     Fulmine dejecti, fundo volvuntur in imo.'

	For the ^pozzo~, cf. G. Agnelli in ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII,
546. -- Why are Satan and the giants placed among the
treacherous?  Perhaps because, created beautiful and strong,
they
turned against their Creator.

	The hardest, coldest heart is that of the traitor; from
it all the warmth of human affection has been banished.  The
symbol of treachery is ice; and at the bottom of the well,
buried
in the circular plain formed by the freezing of Cocytus, are
the
sinners of the ninth and last circle.  In the middle of the
plain, at the centre of the earth, is Lucifer or Satan, called
Dis by the ancients.  Ice is used as a means of punishment in
other visions of Hell, and in the ^Visio Alberici~ we find a
graded immersion in ice; but nowhere else has it the
significance
that our poem gives it.  Dante's traitors have no desire to be
remembered on earth: the best they can hope is to be
forgotten. 
Their evil disposition is unchanged, and even in Hell they are
eager to betray one another.  The cold, cruel spirit that
pervades their congregation communicates itself to the
beholder;
the mere thought of their odious crimes arouses an instinct of
vindictiveness.  Scorn and hatred possess Dante as he
contemplates them, and he feels impelled to pay them in their
own
coin.

	The traitors fall into four divisions, according to the
relation between themselves and their victims.  They are
arranged
in the round plain in four concentric circles; taking them in
order, from {^Caina~ and ^Antenora~ lacking} ^Tolom@ea~
('Ptolemea'), ^Giudecca~ ('Judecca ').  They are distinguished
only by the position of the sinners in the ice: in the first
three,
the souls are embedded up to their heads; in the last,
Giudecca, they are entirely covered.  In Caina, the heads
are bowed down; in Antenora they are apparently
erect; in Tolomea they are thrown back.  Caina contains
traitors
to kindred, Antenora traitors to country or party, Tolomea
traitors to guests, Giudecca traitors to benefactors (or,
according to Del Lungo, to constituted authorities).  In all
cases the treachery involves murder.  Caina and Giudecca are
named respectively for Cain and Judas.  Antenora derives its
title from the Trojan Antenor, who bears an excellent
character
in the ^Iliad~; in the later narratives, however, ascribed to
Dares and Dictys, and regarded in the Middle Ages as an
authentic
account, he figures as the arch-traitor who hands over the
Palladium to the Greeks (cf. Servius's commentary on ^Aen.~,
I,
242).  Tolomea is so called after the Ptolemy of I Macc. xvi,
11-6, a captain of Jericho, who murdered his father-in-law and
two brothers-in-law at a banquet to which he had invited them. 

	|1.  Chiocce,~ `clucking.'  Cf. VII, 2. 

	|3.  Pontan~, `thrust.' 

	|5.  L' abbo~ = ^le ho.~ 

	|9.~  Nor one fit for a childish tongue.  An example of
rhetorical understatement, or litotes: cf. d' Ovidio, 514-9. 

	|10.  Donne~: the Muses, thanks to whom Amphion's lyre
charmed the rocks to move and form the walls of Thebes.  Cf. 
Horace, ^Ars Poetica~, 394 ff.; ^Thebaid~, X, 873 ff. 

	|15.  Mei~ = ^meglio~: cf. XIV, 36.  |Zebe~ = ^capre~, 
`goats.' 

	|16.  Pozzo~: in the ^Visio Alberici~, IX, the mouth of the
pit `similis videbatur puteo.'  See the argument at the head of
the preceding canto. 

	|19.  Udimmi~ = ^mi udii.~  The two brothers who thus
address Dante from the ice are, as we learn presently, the counts
of Mangona. 

	|26.~  The Danube in Austria.  ^Osteric~ and ^Osterlic~ 
were both used in early Italian. 

	|27.~  The Tanais, or Don. 

	|28.  Tambernicchi~ (or ^Tamberlic~ or ^Taberlic~) is an 
unidentified mountain. 

	|29.  Pietrapana~, now called Pania della Croce, is a 
rocky mountain in the Tuscan Apennines. 

	|30.  Cricchi~ or ^cric~ is a word made to imitate the 
sound. 

	|33.~  In the summer, the season when the country woman 
is apt to dream of gleaning. 

	|34.~  As far as their faces: shame manifests itself by a 
blush. 

	|36.~  Their teeth chatter like a stork's bill.  Cf. 
^Met.~, VI, 97: `Ipsa sibi plaudat crepitante ciconia rostro.' 
Also Hugh of St. Victor, ^De Bestiis~, I, 42: `Ciconiae sonum 
oris pro voce quatiente rostro faciunt.'  And Brunetto Latini, 
^Tr$esor~, I, v, 161 (see Tor.). 

	|38.  Freddo~ and |cor~ are subjects of ^procaccia~, of 
which ^testimonianza~ is the object.  The chattering teeth bear 
witness to the cold; the weeping eyes, to the sadness of the 
heart. 

	|42.  Avieno~ = ^avevano.~ 

	|46.~  Their eyes until now `were wet only within' 
because they were frozen over on the outside.  A new flood of 
tears bursts the icy coat for a moment. 

	|48.  Essi~: the eyes.  |Riserrolli~, `locked them up 
again.' 

	|49.~  `Clamp never fastened wood to wood.' 

	|56.~  The Bisenzo is a little stream that runs near 
Prato and empties into the Arno. 

	|57.~  Alberto, count of Mangona.  Two of his sons, 
Napoleone and Alessandro, quarrelled over their inheritance and 
killed each other. 

	|61.~  Mordrec, or Mordred, the treacherous nephew of King
Arthur, was pierced by such a blow from Arthur's spear that, when
the weapon was pulled out, a ray of sunlight traversed his body. 
The story is told in the Old French ^Lancelot du lac~, the
romance which Paolo and Francesca were reading in V, 127. 

	|62.  Con esso~ = ^con~: cf. XXIII, 54. 

	|63.~  Focaccia de' Cancellieri, of the White party of 
Pistoia, lay in wait, with other ruffians, for one of his 
relatives, Detto de' Cancellieri, a Black, and killed him in a 
tailor's shop. 

	|65.~  Sassol Mascheroni is known to us only through an 
early commentator, who says he murdered a nephew to secure his 
inheritance. 

	|67.  Metti~ = ^metta.~ -- |In pi@u sermoni~, `to more 
speech': cf. XIII, 21. 

	|68.~  Of Camicion de' Pazzi nothing certain is known.  He
is said to have treacherously slain a kinsman named Ubertino.

	|69.  Scagioni~, `exculpate,' i.e., make me seem innocent in
comparison with himself.  Carlino de' Pazzi is still alive and
has not yet committed his great crime.  It was in June, 1302,
that he was bribed to surrender to the Florentine Blacks the
castle of Piantravigne, containing a number of the foremost White
and Ghibelline exiles, many of whom were slain.  When he dies, he
will come to the second division of the 9th circle, Antenora, 
reserved for betrayers of their country or party. 

	|70.  Cagnazzi~ `purple': see ^Stud. dant.~, I, 142.  The 
sight is so horrible that Dante ever afterwards will shudder at 
the sight of frozen pools. 

	|71.  Riprezzo~ = ^ribrezzo.~ 

	|72.  Guazzi~ = ^guadi.~ 

	|74.  Si rauna~, `collects.'  Cf. XXXIV, 110-1. 

	|75.  Rezzo~, `chill.' 

	|81.~  The mention of Montaperti arouses Dante's suspicions. 
This was the disastrous defeat of the Florentine Guelfs in 1260
by the Sienese Ghibellines and their German allies.  The rout was
attributed to the traitor Bocca degli Abati, who, in the thick of
a charge, cut off the hand of the standard-bearer to the
Florentine cavalry.  In 1266, when the Guelfs returned to power,
he was banished. 

	|90.  Se fossi vivo~, `even wert thou a living man.' 

	|91.  Puote~ = ^pu@o.~ 

	|95.  Lagna~, `vexation.' 

	|96.  Lama~, `lowland': cf. XX, 79. 

	|97.  Cuticagna~, `scalp.' 

	|100.  Perch@e~, `though.'  ^Dischiomi~, `strip me bald.' 

	|101.  Mostrerolti~ = ^te lo mostrer@o.~ 

	|102.  Tomi~, `fallest.' 

	|105.  Raccolti~, `bent.' 

	|107.  Sonar~, `clatter': is it not enough for thy teeth to
be chattering? 

	|109.  Vo'~ = ^voglio.~ 

	|110.  A la tua onta~, `in spite of thee,' or, literally, 
`to thy shame.' 

	|113.  Eschi~ = ^esca~: formula of adjuration: cf. X, 82. 

	|116.~  Buoso da Duera of Cremona, notorious for his 
faithlessness, was distrusted by friends and enemies.  In 1265, 
being bribed by the French, he allowed the army of Charles of 
Anjou, on its way to the conquest of Naples, to pass by the 
Ghibelline forces that had been detailed to oppose it.  He was 
accused also of appropriating money sent by Manfred to pay his 
soldiers. 

	|117.  Stanno freschi~, `are in the cool.'  This is 
supposed to be the origin of the current phrase, ^star fresco~, 
`to be in for it.' 

	|118.~  `Shouldst thou be asked who else was there.' 

	|119.~  Tesauro dei Beccheria of Pavia, abbot of
Vallombrosa, was tortured and beheaded by the Guelfs of Florence
for conducting secret negotiations with the Ghibelline exiles. 

	|120.  Seg@o...la gorgiera~, `sawed the gorget,' i.e., 
cut the throat. 

	|121.  Gianni de' Soldanier~ was a Ghibelline, who, after
the defeat of his party in 1266, headed a mob against his former
associates. 

	|122.~  Ganelon is the famous traitor to Charlemagne, in the
^Chanson de Roland~; it was he who brought about the destruction
of the rear guard at Roncesvalles and the death of Roland: cf.
XXXI, 16-8. -- The Ghibelline Tebaldello, a bastard of the
Zambrasi family, surrendered to the Bolognese Guelfs his own city
of Faenza in order to avenge himself on some Ghibellines from
Bologna who had taken refuge there. 

	|126.~  Two more political traitors (see d' Ovidio, 14-26)
are frozen in one hole in such a position that the head of one
lies upon the head of the other like a hat. 

	|129.  S'aggiugne~ = ^si congiunge.~ 

	|130.~  Tydeus, one of the seven kings who attacked Thebes,
was mortally wounded by Menalippus, whom he succeeded in killing. 
Before dying, he called for the head of his opponent, and, when
it was brought him by Capaneus, gnawed it fiercely. Cf.
^Thebaid~, VIII, 736 ff. 

	|135.  Per tal convegno~, `on condition.' 

	|137.  Pecca~, `sin.' 

	|118.  Cangi~, `repay.' 

	|139.  Quella~: my tongue.
