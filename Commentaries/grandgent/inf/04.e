	|Proemio.~ A THUNDER clap announces the consummation of the miracle. 
Dante finds himself on the brink of the cliff that surrounds
the
dark abyss.  A 'roar of countless wails' greets his ear.  At
this
sound, Virgil, who later in the journey sternly rebukes Dante
for
his sympathy with the damned, himself turns pale with pity:
while
Reason, face to face with sin, can feel only abhorrence, it
may
well be moved to anguish by contemplation of sin's
consequences.

	The descent of the bank brings the poets to the first
circle of Hell, the Limbus.  The Church fathers defined the
Limbus as an underground place, near Hell and Purgatory, the
abode of the souls of unbaptized children and, until the
Harrowing of Hell, of the virtuous members of the Old Church;
the
only punishment is exile from God's presence; the patriarchs
were
cheered by hope of ultimate rescue.  Salvation can be won only
through faith in Christ: the ancient Hebrews believed in
Christ
to come, Christians believe in Christ already descended and
arisen.  Admission to community with Christ, which redeems man
from original sin, must be sanctified by prescribed rites --
in
Christian times by baptism.

	After the crucifixion Christ went down into Hell, --
breaking the gates, which have ever since remained open, --
and
took from Limbus the souls of the worthy people of the Old
Testament.  The doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell is
foreshadowed
in Messianic tradition.  In the Bible only passing references
to
it are to be found: as in Ephesians iv, 9; 1 Epistle of Peter
iii, 19 and iv, 6; also, according to St. Augustine, in Ps.
cvii
(Vulgate cvi), 14.  It is mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel
of
Peter and described in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus.

	It remained for Dante to place in his Limbus the souls of
virtuous pagans.  These, as they had never believed in Christ,
were not saved, but remained with the unbaptized infants. 
Only
Cato of Utica, who appears in the first canto of the
^Purgatorio~, was apparently released, and is working out his
salvation on the Island of Purgatory; how his entrance into
the
Church is to be effected we are not told.  It is interesting
to
note that in the ^Aeneid~, VI, 426-9, the children are on the
outer edge of the lower world -- 'infantumque animae flentes
in
limine primo.'

	Dante's Limbus is shrouded in darkness and the air
quivers with sighs.  Such is the life of those devoid of true
knowledge of God: their minds are enveloped in ignorance and
their hearts are full of a vague longing forever unsatisfied. 
But those among them who combine wisdom with virtue are
illumined
by mortal intellgence -- a light dim compared with the vision
of
God, but bright beside the obscurity in which their less
gifted
fellows dwell.  The state of the heathen sages of old is
symbolized by the 'nobile castello,' the Palace of Wisdom (or,
as
some understand it of Fame) where the great souls congregate,
'neither happy nor sad,' enjoying the companionship of their
peers and the light of human knowledge.  In the noble castle
are
the 'Magnanimi,' as opposed to the 'Pusillanimi' of the
Antinferno.  Cf. ^Conv.~, I xi 130-151.  Dante's description
of
them is reminiscent of Virgil's Elysian Fields in ^Aen.~, VI,
637 ff.

	J. B. Fletcher sees in the Noble Castle also an allegory
of pagan Rome, destined for the eagle flight but as yet
destitute
of the light of truth; he works out this ingenious conception
in
detail in ^Dante's School of the Eagle~, in ^Romanic Review~,
XXII, 191.

	For a discussion of the Limbus, see M. Scherillo in
^Bull.~, VIII, i; for the palace, A. Fiammazzo, ^Intorno al
"Nobile Castello~ " ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII, 25; for the descent
of
Christ into Hell, M. Dods, ^Forerunners of Dante~, 1903, pp.
83
ff.; W. H. Hulme, ^Harrowing of Hell~, 1907, pp. lxlxx (Early
English Text Society, Extra Series C).

	|2.  Truono~, probably the peal which followed the
lightning of III, 134.  Inasmuch as lines 2 and 3 point to a
sudden noise, this `thunder' can hardly be identical with that
of l. 9.

	|4.  Riposato~, recovered from the dazzling effect of 
the flash. 

	|9.~  In the ^Visio S. Pauli~ there is a `tonitruum' of 
groans and sighs. 

	|11.  Per ficcar~, `however intently I fixed.' 

	|25.  Secondo che~, `as far as one could judge.' 

	|26.  Mai che~, `except.'  ^Mai~, from Latin ^magis~, is 
equivalent to ^pi@u.~ 

	|33.  Andi~ = ^vada.~  Virgil will not have Dante suppose 
for a moment that his companions in Limbus have been evildoers. 

	|38.  Adorar~ = ^adorarono.~ 

	|40.  Rio~, `crime.' 

	|41.  Semo~, equivalent to ^siamo~, was common in early 
Italian. 

	|42.~  In Dante's time the ending -^emo~, in the first 
person plural of verbs of the second and third conjugations,
had not yet been quite supplanted by -^iamo.~ 

	|48.~  As soon as Dante learns that Virgil's soul dwells 
in Limbus, he is eager to receive from this witness
corroboration of the doctrine of the descent of Christ into
Hell. 

	|52.~  Virgil died in the year 19 B.C. 

	|53.~  Christ is never named in the ^Inferno.~ 

	|54.~  Doubtless a cruciform nimbus. 

	|56.  No@e, re, f@e~ (ll. 56, 58, 60) form oxytonic or 
`masculine' rimes, called ^rime tronche.~  Such lines have, as 
printed and as now pronounced, only ten syllables each, instead
of eleven.  It is likely, however, that Dante pronounced
^No@ee, r$ee, f$ee.~ 

	|58.~  Cf. Gen. xvii, 5: `thy name shall be Abraham, for 
a father of many nations have I made thee.' 

	|59.  Isra@el~, Jacob; ^lo padre~, Isaac; ^e suoi nati~, 
his twelve children. 

	|60.~  To win Rachel, Jacob served Laban twice seven 
years: Gen. xxix, 1828. 

	|63.~  Before the descent of Christ all human souls went, 
if bad, to Hell, if good, to Limbus.  Since that time Christian
souls penitent at the moment of death have gone to Purgatory. 

	|64.  Dicessi~ = ^dicesse.~  Early usage hesitated 
between final ^i~ and ^e~ in many verb forms. 

	|68.  Sonno~, the swoon of l. 1.  Some texts have 
^sommo~, the `proda della valle d' abisso' of ll. 7-8. 

	|69.~  A light radiates up in all directions from the 
Castle, forming a hemisphere of brightness over and about it. 
|Vincia~ is generally understood as the imperfect of ^vincere~,
i.e., `overcame'; the ending -^ia~ for -^ea~ or -^eva~ was 
common.  Torraca, however, regards it as the imperfect of 
^vincire~, `to bind,' and makes |emisperio~ the subject: `which
a hemisphere of darkness enclosed.' 

	|72.  Orrevol, orranza~ -- more commonly ^onrevole, 
onranza~ -- are contracted forms of ^onorevole, onoranza.~ 
Note the repetition of ^onore~ and its derivatives in ll. 72,
73, 74, 76, 80, 93, 100.  Cf. the second stanza of ^Ora pot om~
by Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. 

	|76.~  God allows the intelligence, by the good use of 
which they won such renown on earth, to remain with them in the
other world. 

	|79.~  We are not told which of the spirits utters the 
greeting to Virgil. 

	|86.~  Homer is depicted with a sword because he sang of 
arms.  According to ^Vulg. El.~, II, ii, the three best themes 
of poetry are arms, love, and righteousness. 

	|88.~  Dante did not know Homer directly.  The reputation 
of the latter as `sovereign poet' must have survived in school 
tradition.  In the ^Ars Poetica~, 73-4, Horace says: 

     `Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella 
     Quo scribi posset numero, monstravit Homerus.' 

A passage in ^Vita Nuova~, XXV, 88-92, suggests that Dante may 
have formed his impression of Homer, in part, through Horace. 
It is noteworthy that the ancient poets thus grouped in the 
^Inferno~ are cited together in the same chapter of the ^Vita 
Nuova.~  Dante was thoroughly familiar with Virgil, Ovid, and 
Lucan.  Another ancient poet whom he had read much, Statius, 
appears in Purgatory. 

	|89.~  The ^Odes~ and ^Epodes~ were probably unknown to 
Dante.  In the ^Ars Poetica~, 235, Horace speaks of himself as 
a writer of satire. 

	|93.~  They do well to honor in me the name of poet, 
which they all share. 

	|100.  Fenno~ = ^fecero.~ 

	|104.~  Things appropriate to that time and place, but 
not to the present poem. 

	|107.~  The Palace of Wisdom is surrounded by seven walls 
representing the four moral virtues (prudence, temperance, 
fortitude, and justice) and the three intellectual virtues 
(understanding, knowledge, and wisdom).  The stream may well 
stand for eloquence. 

	|110.~  The gates probably symbolize the seven liberal 
arts of the ^trivium~ (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and the 
^quadrivium~ (music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy), which 
afford access to knowledge. 

	|112.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ VI, 63: `E nel mover degli occhi 
onesta e tarda.' 

	|118.~  It has been suggested that ^diritto~ means 
`opposite' rather than `upright.'  ^Giorn. stor.~, LXXVII, 137. 

	|121.~  Electra, daughter of Atlas, and mother of 
Dardanus who was the founder of Troy: ^Aen.~, VIII, 134-5.  Cf.
^Mon.~, II, iii, 68-9: `avia vetustissima, Electra.' 

	|123.~  Caesar, the founder of the Empire, is briefly 
described as `in arms, with hawk-like eyes.'  Nowhere in the
poem do we find a long description or discussion of him.  While
he deserved, by virtue of his great political act, a place in 
history beside that of Christ, he was probably, as a tyrant and
the opponent of Cato, distasteful to Dante. 

	|124.~  Camilla, a warrior maiden: ^Aen.~, XI, 498 ff. 
Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons: ^Aen.~, I, 490 ff. 

	|125.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VII, 45 ff. 

	|127.~  The other Brutus is in the centre of Hell. 
|Tarquino~, for ^Tarquinio~, was regular in early Italian.  Cf.

^Lavina~ for ^Lavinia~ in l. 126. 

	|128.~  Lucretia, wife of Collatinus; Julia, daughter of 
Caesar, wife of Pompey; Marcia, wife of Cato of Utica (cf. 
^Purg.~ I, 79; ^Conv.~, IV, xxviii, 97 ff.); Cornelia, mother
of the Gracchi. 

	|129.~  Saladin, the model of chivalry, was sultan of 
Egypt and Syria in the 12th century.  He is different in race
and religion from those mentioned hitherto. 

	|131.~  Aristotle, whom Dante often calls simply `il 
Filosofo,' and to whom he repeatedly refers in terms of the 
deepest admiration.  Aristotle was known to Dante in two Latin 
translations, one of which had been made by, or for, St.
Thomas.  

	|136.~  Democritus, known to Dante probably through 
Cicero. 

	|137.~  Anaxagoras, cited by Aristotle.  Thales, one of 
the seven wise men of Greece: ^Conv.~, III, xi, 39. 

	|138.~  Empedocles, to whose doctrine reference is made 
in ^Inf.~ XII, 42.  Heraclitus, mentioned by Aristotle.  Zeno, 
stoic philosopher: ^Conv.~, IV, vi, 84. 

	|139.~  Dioscorides wrote a treatise on plants and their 
properties: |quale~ here means `qualities' (of plants). 

	|140.~  Orpheus, considered as a philosopher: ^Conv.~, 
II, i, 25-34. 

	|141.~  Tully, or Cicero, was one of the first 
philosophers that Dante studied: ^Conv.~, II, xiii, 17 ff.; see
also ^Inf.~ X, 22-4.  Livy wrote philosophical works, mentioned
in a letter of Seneca to Lucilius; most texts have Lino, i.e., 
Linus, an imaginary Greek poet.  Seneca the moralist was
thought to be a different person from the dramatist: see P.
Toynbee in ^Giorn. stor.~, XXV, 334; E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~,
XXIII, 33-6; also, however, S. Debenedetti, ^Dante e Seneca
morale~, in ^Studi danteschi~, VI, 5. 

	|142.~  Ptolemy, the great geographer and astronomer of 
Alexandria, who lived in the second century B.C. 

	|143.~  Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen: three famous 
physicians of Greece, Turkestan, and Mysia. 

	|144.~  Averro,es, a Spanish Moor of the 12th century, 
was a celebrated scholar and philosopher.  Having read the
works of Aristotle in ancient Syriac translations, he composed
three commentaries on them; one of these, the `gran commento,'
was followed by St. Thomas.  As he inclined towards pantheism
and materialism, he was regarded in the 14th century as the
master of free-thinkers. -- |Feo~ = ^fece.~ 

	|148.~  The company of six dwindles to two -- Virgil and 
Dante. 

	|150.~  Out of the peaceful atmosphere of the Palace into 
the air that quivers with sighs: cf. ll. 26-7. 

	|151.  Ove non @e che luca~, `where there is nothing 
shining': beyond the brightness of the Palace.
