	|Proemio.~ FOR the reason already mentioned, Dante likes to pass
lightly over the transitions from one step to another.  Thus,
when he awakens from his second swoon, he finds himself once
more
mysteriously transported, this time to the third terrace.
Gluttony, the next of the sins of Incontinence, is essentially
foul and selfish, and so is fitly symbolized by the cold,
slimy
filth which constitutes the punishment of the third circle. 
It
is a sin that robs men of their humanity, making them
unrecognizable to their friends.  Its perfect embodiment is
Cerberus, the tormenting genius of the place.  This beast,
opposing the poets' passage, is offered a double handful of
mud,
which it eagerly devours.  So in the ^Aeneid~, VI, 417-23,
Cerberus is pacified by the Sibyl with a honey-cake:

     'Cerberus haec ingens latratu regna trifauci
     Personat, adverso recubans immanis in antro.
     Cui vates, horrere videns jam colla colubris,
     Melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam
     Objicit: ille fame rabida tria guttura pandens,
     Corripit objectam, atque immania terga resolvit
     Fusus humi, totoque ingens extenditur antro.'

The substitution of dirt for medicated sweets serves still
further to debase greediness.

	With one of the souls here confined Dante holds converse.
This is Ciacco, a Florentine renowned both for his gluttony
and
for his cleverness, who figures also in one of Boccaccio's
tales,
^Decameron~, IX, 8.  It is not certain whether ^Ciacco~ was
his
real name -- perhaps a synonym of Jacopo -- or a nickname
meaning
'pig'; nor is it known whether he is to be identified with a
poet
called Ciacco dell' Anguillaia.  In response to a question by
Dante, this spirit prophesies the approaching victory of the
Whites -- the ^selvaggia~ or 'rustic' party -- over their
opponents, and the ensuing triumph of the Blacks through the
connivance of Boniface VIII.  In Florence, he further
declares,
there are only two just men, and they have no influence.  Who
these two are, we are not told.  A comparison with the close
of
Canzone IX -- in which Dante sends his song 'to the three
least
guilty of our city' -- and with ^Purg.~ XVI 124-6 (where the
only
three good men now left in Lombardy are named), makes it
likely
that the poet had in mind two specific persons; but it is
impossible to guess whom he meant.

	In ll. 35-6 Dante speaks of walking over the empty shades
which look like real people.  Throughout Hell the souls,
though
without weight, are not only visible and audible, but
tangible.
On the lower slopes of the mountain of Purgatory, however,
Dante
cannot touch a shade (^Purg.~ II, 79 ff.), although two
spirits
can still embrace (^Purg.~ VI, 75); and near the summit one
soul
apparently cannot clasp another (^Purg.~ XXI, 130 ff.).  In
^Purg.~ XXV 79 ff. we are informed that after death the
atmosphere collects around the departed spirit, forming an
aerial
body, which reflects all the emotions of the soul itself. 
Although Dante nowhere says so explicitly, it would seem that
he
chose to regard this airy shape as more substantial in
proportion
to its proximity to the centre of gravity of the universe
(which
is also the centre of sin), and more ethereal as it rises
above
the earth's surface.  This conception of the shade appears to
be
Dante's own, although we find that St. Thomas mentions the
power
of angels and devils to assume aerial forms.

	|2.~  Cf. Brunetto Latini, ^Tesoretto~, III, 1-3. 

	|13.  Diversa~, `strange.' 

	|18.  Scuoia~, `flays': some texts have ^ingoia~, 
`swallows.' 

	|21.  Profani~, the impious gluttons, `whose God is their 
belly': Phil. iii, 19. 

	|22.  Vermo~, `worm' or `dragon.'  In ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 108, 
Lucifer is called `il vermo reo.'  In the ^Visio Alberici~, IX,
there is at the entrance of Hell a `vermis infinitae 
magnitudinis' bound with a great chain.  Cf. German ^Wurm.~ 

	|23.  Sanne~, `fangs.'

	|25.  Spanne~, palms and fingers. 

	|28.  Agugna~, `craves.' 

	|30.~  `Strains and struggles.'  The use of the word 
|pugna~ may have been suggested by the heading of a chapter in 
the ^De Animalibus~ of Albertus Magnus: `De ^pugna~ animalium
pro cibo et pullis.' 

	|34.  Adonare~, which recurs in ^Purg.~ XI, 19, was used 
also by G. Villani, always in the sense of `subdue.' 

	|48.  Maggio~ for ^maggiore~ was not uncommon in early 
Italian. -- Dante, who has not yet seen the rest of Hell,
assumes that no punishment can be more disgusting than this. 

	|51.~  To the lost souls the earthly life appears, by 
contrast, clear and beautiful. 

	|54.  Mi fiacco~, `I am broken.' 

	|58.~  Note the similarity of II. 58-9 to V, 116-7, which 
express the same sentiment in different words. 

	|65.  Verranno al sangue~, a biblical phrase: I Sam. xxv, 
26, `prohibuit ne venires in sanguinem,' i.e., `hath withholden

thee from coming to shed blood.' -- After long strife between
the adherents of the Donati, representing the old aristocracy,
and the followers of the Cerchi, who had come to Florence from
the country and enriched themselves by commerce, blood was shed
in an encounter on May 1, 1300.  In June, 1301, the leaders of
the Black or Donati party conspired against their opponents,
and in consequence were exiled. -- G.  Villani says that the
Cerchi were `di bizzarra salvatichezza,' or `curiously rustic.' 

	|67.~  The Blacks having gained the upper hand through 
the cunning of Boniface VIII and his pretended `peace-maker,' 
Charles of Valois, banished, between January 1 and October 1, 
1302, some 600 Whites.  Dante was sentenced on January 27, and 
again on March 10. -- |Tre soli~ means three solar years, 
beginning January 1; the Florentine year began on March 25. 

	|69.  Tal~ is Boniface.  ^Piaggiare~ meant `to temporize'
(perhaps originally `to hug the shore') and also `to go to law'
(cf. Proven$cal ^plach~ and Italian ^piato~, `law-suit'):
either meaning would fit here, as the Pope in 1300 was acting 
ambiguously and was also engaged in litigation with Florence. 

	|72.  Adonti~, `be shamed.'  According to M. Porena, in 
^La Rassegna~, 1924, p. 148, the two verbs refer to the 
^appresso~, being prophetic of retribution to come. 

	|77.  Vo'~ = ^voglio.~ 

	|78.  Facci~ = ^faccia.~ 

	|79.~  In early Italian the combination -^aio~ or -^oio~ 
often counted as one syllable. 

	|84.  Addolcia~, `sweetens'; ^attosca~, `envenoms.' 

	|85.~  Farinata degli Uberti is among the heretics, X, 
32; Tegghiaio Aldobrandi and Jacopo Rusticucci are with the 
sodomites, XVI, 41, 44; Mosca dei Lamberti is one of the sowers
of discord, XXVIII, 106.  Arrigo, who cannot be identified with
certainty, is not mentioned again. 

	|93.  Con essa~, i.e., head and all. 

	|96.  Nimica~, `hostile' to sin.  ^Pod@esta~ = 
^potest@a~, Christ; cf. John v, 27: `And [the Father] hath
given him authority (^potestatem~) to execute judgment also,
because he is the Son of man.'  On the Day of Judgment, at the
sound of the last trumpet, all souls in Heaven and Hell will
return to earth, resume their bodies, gather in the Valley of
Jehoshaphat, and listen to their eternal sentence; after which
they will go back to their respective places. 

	|103.  Esti~ = ^questi.~ 

	|105.  Fier~ = ^fiano~ = ^saranno.~ 

	|106.  Tua scienza~, philosophy.  Tor. cites from Fra 
Giordano: `Dicono i santi e' savi che 'l corpo nostro non @e
uomo per s@e, n@e l' anima non @e uomo per s@e; n@e ha l'uno
natura perfetta per s@e solo, ma l' anima e il corpo congiunti
insieme fanno uomo, sono una natura compiuta e perfetta.'  Tor.
quotes also from St. Thomas: `The soul separated from the body
is, in a way, imperfect, like any part existing outside of its
whole, since the soul is naturally a part of human nature. 
Man, then, cannot attain the utmost felicity until it is
reunited to the body.'  If the bodiless soul cannot attain the
utmost happiness, we may infer that it cannot attain the utmost
misery.  It follows that the pains of Hell will be severer
after the Judgment, because, although the word `perfection'
cannot be fitly applied to `these accursed people,' they expect
to be more complete after the Great Day than before it, 

	|114.  Dove si digrada~, `where the descent is.' 

	|115.  Pluto~, Plutus, the god of wealth, who was not 
always distinguished even by the ancients, from Pluto.
