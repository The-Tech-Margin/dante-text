	|Proemio.~ OPENING in mock heroic continuation of the gross theme
immediately preceding, this canto goes on to describe the ways
of
grafters -- who, it would seem, are especially rife in remote
dependencies.  It relates the capture of one of them by the
infernal sleuth-hounds and his clever escape from the
domineering
Barbariccia, the suspicious Cagnazzo, the over-confident
Alichino, the quarrelsome Calcabrina, and their fierce
comrades.
