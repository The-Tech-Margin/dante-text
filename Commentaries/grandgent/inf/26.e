	|Proemio.~ ONCE more a respite is afforded from the
oppressiveness of Malebolge.  Ulysses tells of
his last journey, and his sea-story breaks in upon the grim
nightmare like a whiff of fresh breeze.  This 'mad flight' of
the
Ithacan out into the great waters seems to be essentially an
invention of our poet.  Although Solinus records an old
tradition
that Ulysses sailed into the Atlantic and founded Lisbon and
Claudian mentions a voyage to a land of shades in that part of
Gaul which projects furthest into the ocean, their tales have
almost nothing in common with his.  Dante's imagination must
have
been stirred by the adventures of St. Brendan in his search
for
the Isles of the Blest, and by other yarns of wondrous voyages
and expeditions to the Earthly Paradise; but he imitates none
of
them in this narrative.  Homer he had not read.

	Ulysses is found in the eighth ^bolgia~, among evil
counsellors, those who applied their burning eloquence to the
concealment of their real mind.  They are completely enveloped
in
tongues of fire, which 'steal' them from sight, just as in
life
their flaming speech cunningly hid their thought.  Fire, the
symbol of divine anger, is an appropriate punishment, because
their sin consists in the misuse of superior mental power, the
direct gift of God, who breathes into men at birth the
intellective soul endowed witb greater or less keenness of
intelligence according to his grace.  Dante, one of the most
favored in this respect, manifests particular interest in the
fate of his intellectual compeers, and warns himself against
falling into the error that wrought their destruction.

	See M. Porena, ^Il Canto d'Ulisse~ in ^Rivista
d'Italia~, Sept. 1902; I. Sanesi, ^L'ultima navigazione
d'Ulisse~, 1919; ^Stud. dant.~, VI, 18 (Seneca in an epistle
raises
the question whether Ulysses traveled beyond the known world);
A.
H. Gilbert, ^Dante's Conception of Justice~, 1925, p. 103
(expresses the opinion that the sinners of this canto are
tricksters rather than evil counselors; but see XXVII, 116).

	|7.~  It was an ancient and popular belief that dreams 
occurring just before dawn would come true: cf. ^Purg.~ IX~, 16-
18.  The poet seems to regard the present time of depravity as a
dark night, to be followed ere long (as he repeatedly attests) by
a better day.  His prophecy is conceived just as the new morrow
is about to dawn.  According to Parodi the new light is to dawn
with Henry VII. 

	|8.  Di qua da picciol tempo~, `within a short time.' 

	|9.  Prato~ is a little town near Florence: thou shalt feel
the grief which even thy nearest neighbors wish thee, not to
mention thine enemies.  Parodi thinks the reference must be to a
recent event: on April 6, 1309, Prato expelled the Neri, and,
shortly after, was punished for it.  See ^Dante e Prato~, 1922,
especially the article ^Dante e il cardinal Niccol@o da Prato~,
by V. Biagi, on p. 77. 

	|10.  Per tempo~, `too early.' 

	|11.  Cos@i foss' ei~, `would it were so,' i.e., would 
that the blow had already fallen! 

	|12.~  The poet's mood changes from vindictiveness to 
tenderness. 

	|13.~  The `stairs' lead from the bank to the top of the 
ridge; they consist of `bourns,' or rocky projections.  Having 
climbed the ridge, the travelers pursue their way over the 8th 
arch. 

	|15.  Mee~ = ^me.~ 

	|17.  Rocchi~, `crags': cf. XX, 25. 

	|18.  Si spedia~, `proceeded.' 

	|22.~  That it (my genius) may not run without the 
guidance of virtue.' 

	|23.~  The `something better' is divine grace. 

	|24.~  The |che~ in this line is superfluous.  |Invidi~, 
`begrudge,' i.e., deprive myself of it by misuse, as these souls
have done. 

	|25.  Quante~ modifies ^lucciole~ in l. 29.  In this pretty
simile of the fireflies, the season which is indicated (ll. 26-7)
is the summer solstice, the hour (l. 28) is dusk. 

	|26.  Colui~: the sun, whose `face' is `least hidden' at the
time when the nights are shortest. 

	|33.  `Ve~ = ^ove~: as soon as I was high enough on the
bridge to see the bottom of the ditch. 

	|34.  Colui~: Elisha (2 Kings ii, 23-4).  |Qual~ modifies 
^carro~ in l. 35. 

	|35.  Elia~, `Elijah': 2 Kings ii, 9-12. 

	|36.  Levorsi~ = ^si levarono.~ 

	|39.  Nuvoletta~: cf. ^V. N.~, XXIII, 52, 187. 

	|40.  Ciascuna~, sc., ^fiamma~: cf. l. 31.  

	|42.  Invola~, `steals': Dante conceives of these flames as
stealing, i.e., secreting, the sinners contained within them. 

	|43.  Surto~ = ^sorto~, `erect.' 

	|44.  Ronchion~: cf. XXIV, 28. 

	|45.  Urto~ = ^urtato.~ 

	|48.  Che~ is loosely used for ^onde~ or ^da cui.~ 

	|50.  M' era avviso~, `it seemed to me.' 

	|54.~  Eteocles and Polynices, the rival sons of 
Oedipus, contending for the possession of Thebes, killed each 
other.  When their bodies were burned on the same pyre, the 
flames divided into two peaks.  ^Theb.~, XII, 420 f.  Cf. 
^Phars.~, I, 551-2: 

     `Scinditur in partes, geminoque cacumine surgit, 
     Thebanos imitata rogos.' 

	|57.~  Ulysses and Diomed, two of the leading heroes of 
the Trojan war, go together in their punishment, as they went 
together to expose themselves to divine wrath. 

	|58.  Si geme~, `they moan for.' 

	|59.~  `The ambush of the horse': the wooden horse full of
Greek warriors, which the Trojans were persuaded to take into the
city.  By this means Troy was destroyed, and Aeneas and his
followers, who afterwards founded the Roman stock, had to flee: 
^Aen.~, II, 13 ff.  In Virgil's account, Diomed has no share in
this enterprise. 

	|61.  Entro~ is an adverb, `inside.'  Thetis, to save her 
son Achilles from the war, disguised him as a girl and entrusted
him to King Lycomedes of Scyros; there he won the love of the 
king's daughter Deidamia, and promised that he would be true to 
her.  Discovered by Ulysses and Diomed, he departed with them to
the war, and forgot his promise.  ^Deidamia~ now mourns in the 
Limbus: ^Purg.~ XXII, 114.  The story is related by Statius in
the ^Achilleid~, II, 15 ff. 

	|63.~  Ulysses and Diomed stole the Palladium, an image of
Pallas, on which the fate of Troy depended: ^Aen.~, II, 162 ff. 

	|67.  Facci~ = ^faccia.~ -- |Niego~, `denial': of waiting 
for the `horned flame.' 

	|72.  Si sostegna~ = ^sostenga~, `restrain itself.' 

	|73.  Concetto~, `guessed.' 

	|74.  Schivi~, `shy': of thy speech.  From these lines and
XXVII, 33, it may be inferred that Virgil thought himself less
remote than Dante from the ancient Greeks, and more likely to
influence them.  Moreover, Dante thought of himself as by remote
descent a Trojan, while Virgil came from a city of Greek origin. 

	|78.  Audivi~ = ^udii.~ 

	|80.~  Virgil assumes that he has immortalized Ulysses 
and Diomed in his ^Aeneid.~ 

	|84.  Per lui...gissi~ (^si g@i~) = ^egli and@o~: for this 
curious construction, see I, 126. 

	|91.~  Circe, daughter of the sun, was a sorceress who 
turned men into beasts: ^Aen.~, VII, 10 ff.  Ulysses visited her
and compelled her to restore her victims to human form: ^Met.~, 
XIV, 245 ff. 

	|92.~  Aeneas named the place in memory of his nurse Caieta,
who had died there: ^Aen.~, VII, 1 ff.; ^Met.~, XIV, 441 ff. 

	|94.  Pieta~, `duty': to my `old father.' 

	|99.  Valore~,' goodness. 

	|103.~  Ulysses explores both shores of the 
Mediterranean, and its islands. 

	|108.~  `Where Hercules set up his marks': the pillars of 
Hercules, on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. 

	|109.  Pi@u oltre non: ne plus ultra.~ 

	|110.  Sibilia~: Seville. 

	|111.  Setta~: Ceuta. 

	|112.~  Cf. the speech of Aeneas beginning `O soci': 
^Aen.~, I, 198 ff.  |Milia~ = ^mila.~ 

	|115.  Ch' @e del rimanente~, `which is left.' 

	|117.  Diretro al sol~, `following the sun': sailing into 
the west.  `The world without men' is the Hemisphere of Water. 

	|121.  Aguti~, `keen.' 

	|124.~  They turn their stern to the morning and sail forth,
constantly gaining on the left; that is, their course is not due
west, but southwest. 

	|128.  Vedea la notte~ may mean `night beheld' or `I beheld
at night.'  |Il nostro~: our northern pole; when they pass the
equator, the North Star sinks below the `sea level.' 

	|130.  Casso~, `quenched.'  They have sailed five months. 

	|131.~  `The light beneath the moon' may mean the moonlight
on the water or the light which is on the under side of the moon
(i.e., the side turned toward the earth). 

	|133.~  Doubtless the mountain of Purgatory, directly 
opposite Jerusalem, in the middle of the Hemisphere of Water: cf.
^Purg.~ III, 15; ^Par.~ XXVI, 139.  |Bruna~, `murky.' 

	|137.  Turbo~ = ^turbine~, `whirlwind.' 

	|138.  Il primo canto~, `the front end,' i.e., the prow. 

	|139.  Con tutte l' acque~, `together with the waters': 
cf. XXII, 147. 

	|140.~  With |levar~ (and with ^ire~ in l. 141) supply
^f@e~, i.e., ^fece.~  For the description of the shipwreck, cf. 
^Aen.~, I, 113-7: 

     `Unam, quae Lycios fidumque vehebat Orontem, 
     Ipsius ante oculos ingens a vertice pontus 
     In puppim ferit; excutitur pronusque magister 
     Volvitur in caput; ast illam ter fluctus ibidem 
     Torquet agens circum, et rapidus vorat aequore vortex.'
