	|Proemio.~ THE third and innermost ring of the seventh circle
consists of a sandy plain upon which falls a rain of fire.  It
stands for the experience of those who directly and wittingly
defy God and live in his wrath, of which fire is the symbol.
'Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
and fire from the Lord out of heaven,' says Gen. xix, 24.  And
in
Ezekiel xxxviii, 22, we read: 'I will rain upon him, and upon
his
bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an
overflowing
rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.'  The
blasphemers, who did violence to God himself, lie prostrate;
the
sodomites, sinners against God's minister, Nature, run
incessantly; the usurers, outragers of human industry, the
child
of Nature, sit crouching.  Of these classes, the second is
largest.

	Rather curiously, the first class is represented by a
pagan, the tall Capaneus, who, 'scornful and twisted,'
maintains
his arrogant pose and 'seems not to be ripened by the rain.' 
His
futile pride is more shocking to Reason than any offence yet
encountered; his own rage is his worst punishment.  St. Thomas
says, in his commentary on Aristotle (quoted in Flamini, I,
143):
'Est aliquis qui non est vere audax, sed videtur: scilicet
superbus, quoniam fingit se esse fortem; unde, sicut fortis
vel
audax se habet circa terribilia, ita superbus quaerit
apparere.'  The story of Capaneus is told by Statius in the
^Thebaid~, X, 870-939: he was one of the seven kings who
attacked
Thebes; scaling the walls, whence his gigantic shadow
frightened
the city, he mocked at the gods and challenged Jove, who
thereupon slew him with a thunderbolt.

     'Ille jacet lacerae complexus fragmina turris,
     Torvus adhuc visu.' -- ^Thebaid~, XI, 9-10.

So he lies in Hell, taunting Jove with his labors at the
battle
against the giants.  Statius, too, recalls this conflict,
saying
that at the downfall of Capaneus the other gods rejoiced with
Jupiter, 'as if he were wearily toiling in the fight at
Phlegra.'

	Traversing the plain, from the wood to the great
precipice, is a raised channel built like a dike, through
which
runs a torrent of boiling blood.  This brook issues from the
river of the first ring and falls over the cliff into the
circle
below.  All the rivers of Hell in fact, are connected, forming
a
single stream, which assumes different shapes in the various
circles.  Its source is now described.  In the island of
Crete,
midway between the old world and the new is the figure of an
aged
man, fashioned like the 'great image' in the dream of
Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel ii, 32-3: 'This image's head was of
fine
gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his
thighs
of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of
clay.'  Daniel interprets the image as a prophecy of four
kingdoms.  But Dante's statue evidently represents humanity in
its successive ages as they are depicted, for instance, in
Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~, I, 89 ff.  The clay foot signifies the weak
and
unstable condition of man.  Ever since the Golden Age (the
state
of Adam and Eve before the fall) mankind has been imperfect;
therefore all the statue except the head is split by a crack,
St.
Thomas's 'vulneratio naturae.'  From this fissure flow the
tears
of the sinful generations of men; descending into Hell, they
make
the infernal streams.  The torments of the human soul, in
whatsoever form they appear, really consist in sorrow over its
own imperfections.  It should be remembered that Crete is a
half-way station between the Old World and the New. Aeneas
stopped there, on his way from Troy to Latium; St. Paul, lost
in
a storm, stopped there, going from Jerusalem to Rome.  But
Aeneas, representing Empire, and St. Paul representing the
Cross, did not come together.  Therefore Humanity is still
imperfect, the conjunction of Eagle and Cross being needed for
its redemption.  The Old Man looks forward to their union in
Rome.

	The bed of the connecting brook is all of stone, bottom
and sides; and so are the high, flat, narrow banks on either
hand.  On one of these -- the nearer, right-hand one -- the
poets
mount to pursue their way across the desert; for no fire falls
upon the duct.  With great solemnity Virgil directs his
disciple's attention to the stream, 'which deadens all the
flamelets above it.'  Nothing so noteworthy has been seen, he
declares, since they entered the open gate of Hades.  The
unclosed door seems to figure our predisposition to sin.  Does
the quenching of the fire by boiling blood signify the
appeasing
of God's anger by human suffering?  A symbol of atonement is
manifestly out of place in the literal Hell; but allegorically
Dante's lower world stands for the sinful life of man. 
Christian
tradition had come to derive the four rivers of Paradise from
the
tears of Christ, and one branch of the story traced to the
same
source even the rivers of the lower world.

	|8.  tanda~, `plain.' 

	|12.  A randa a randa~, `at the very edge.' 

	|13.  Spazzo~ (= ^spazio~), `floor.' 

	|15.~  Cato led the remnants of Pompey's army across the 
Libyan desert in 47 B.C.  Cf. Lucan, ^Pharsalia~, IX, 371 ff., 
particularly 378 and 394-6: 

     `Atque ingressurus steriles, sic fatur, arenas: 
     ... ... ... ... 
     ... ...Dum primus arenas 
     Ingrediar, primusque gradus in pulvere ponam, 
     Me calor aethereus feriat.' 

	|16.  Dei~ = ^devi.~ 

	|30.~  Dante repeatedly uses |alpe~ for mountains in 
general, sometimes for Apennines. 

	|31.~  Dante apparently got this story from Albertus 
Magnus.  It is a fusion of two episodes from the so-called 
Epistle of Alexander to Aristotle, where we find a heavy fall
of snow, trampled down by the soldiers, and later a rain of
fire. 

	|35.  Acci@o che~, `inasmuch as.' -- |Vapore~, `flame.' 

	|36.  Mei~ = ^meglio.~ 

	|45.  Uscinci~ = ^ci uscirono.~ 

	|52.  Se~, `though'; so in l. 55.  Even though Jove 
should labor as he did in the battle against the giants, in the
valley of Phlegra in Thessaly, he could not subdue the spirit
of Capaneus. 

	|55.  Li altri~: the cyclops, assistants of Vulcan. -- ^A 
muta a muta~, `in relays'; Statius, ^Thebaid~, II, 599-600, has
the phrase ^mutata~...^fulmina.~ 

	|56.  Mongibello~ is a Sicilian name for Aetna. 

	|67.  Labbia~, `countenance.' 

	|68.  Regi~ = ^re.~ 

	|73.  Metti~ = ^metta.~ 

	|79.  Bulicame~: a hot spring near Viterbo, frequented as 
a bath.  The stream isuing from it was divided into separate 
baths for prostitutes, who were compelled to stay apart from
the others. 

	|84.  tici~ = ^l@i.~ 

	|87.  Sogliare~ = ^soglia~, `threshold.'  The gate is the 
entrance to Hell. 

	|90.  Ammorta~ = ^ammorza~ (l. 63), `quenches.' 

	|94.  Guasto~, `waste.' 

	|96.~  In the golden age, under Saturn. 

	|99.  Vieta~, `aged.' 

	|100.~  Rhea, wife of Saturn, to save the infant Jupiter 
from his father, who devoured his sons, entrusted him to the 
Curetes, or Corybantes, in Crete; and when he cried, she had
them drown the sound with noise.  Cf. Virgil, ^Georgics~, IV,
150-2; Ovid, ^Fasti~, IV, 197-210. 

	|104.~  Damietta, an important city on the Egyptian 
shore, represents the East, the ancient, pagan world; Rome
stands for the modern, Christian world. 

	|105.  Speglio~ = ^specchio.~ 

	|109.  Eletto~, `choice.' 

	|115.  Si diroccia~, `precipitates itself.' 

	|116.~  Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and Cocytus all belong 
to the classic undcrworld.  The ^Visio Sancti Pauli~ gives the 
four rivers as `Cochiton, Styx, Acheron, Flegeton.' 

	|117.  Doccia~, `duct.' 

	|119.~  The frozen Cocytus forms the bottom of Dante's 
Hell, beyond which 'there is no descending,' because it is at
the earth's centre. 

	|123.~  `Why do we see it only at this edge?': that is, 
why have we not crossed it in our spiral descent? Virgil
replies that they have not made the whole circuit of the
circumference of Hell. 

	|129.  De'~ = ^deve.~ 

	|132.  Piova~ = ^pioggia~, the rain of tears that forms 
the stream -- |D@i~ = ^dici.~ 

	|135.  Faci~ = ^fai.~  The heat of this stream proves 
that it is Phlegethon; see ^Aen.~, VI, 550-1: 

     `Quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis 
     Tartareus Phlegethon,' 

and Statius, ^Thebaid~, IV, 523: 

     `Fumidus atra vadis Phlegethon incendia volvit.' 

	|136.~  Lethe is in the lower world of the ancients; but 
Dante puts it in the Garden of Eden, at the top of the mountain
of Purgatory.  See E. Ciafardini ^L'Idrografia dell' rnferno e 
del Purgatorio dantesco~, in ^Studii in onore di Francesco~ 
^Torraca~, 1922, p. 260. 

	|138.  Pentuta~ = ^Pentita.~ 

	|140.  Vegne~ = ^venga.~
