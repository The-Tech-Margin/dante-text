	|Proemio.~ THE sight of the sowers of discord exercises a curious
fascination on the beholder, who gazes on their 'strange
wounds'
with 'drunken eyes' until he is brought to his senses by a
reproof from Virgil.  In other words, Dante, who was himself
prone to strife, in his contemplation of this sin is beginning
to
feel more satisfaction than abhorrence, and needs to be warned
by
Reason that he is not meditating in the proper spirit.  A
similar
lapse is described at the end of the next canto.  Dante
attempts
to justify his eagerness by the statement that he was
searching
for the shade of Geri del Bello, a first cousin of his father,
who is punished in this ditch.  The early commentators give
Geri
a black character; but we really know little of him except
that
his house was damaged by the Ghibellines in 1260, that he
received compensation for it from the Guelfs in 1269, and that
he
was killed by one of the Sacchetti.  The resulting feud
between
the families was ended by a reconciliation in 1342.  In 1300
his
death, to Dante's shame, was still unavenged.  Vengeance for a
relative's murder was regarded, in spite of Christian
teaching,
as a part of a gentleman's duty.  This doctrine is explicitly
laid down by Brunetto Latini in his ^Tesoretto~, XVIII.  Dante
himself wrote, in Canzone XII, 83:

     'Ch@e bell' onor s' acquista in far vendetta.'

Forese Donati, in his third sonnet to Dante, derisively said
to
him:

     'Ben so che fosti figliuol d' Allaghieri,
     E accorgomene pur alla vendetta
     Che facesti di lui s@i bella e netta.'

	The tenth valley -- the last of Malebolge -- contains
falsifiers of all kinds.  Those described fall into four
classes:
falsifiers of metals, or alchemists; falsifiers of persons, or
impersonators; falsifiers of coin, or counterfeiters;
falsifiers
of words, or liars.  It is to be noted that the alchemists
here
confined are damned as cheats, not as disturbers of God's
creation.  The sin of all these culprits is symbolized by
devastating disease, which alters their appearance: as they
tried
to change the aspect of things, so are they transformed by
loathsome maladies.

	See I. Del Lungo, ^Dal secolo e dal poema di Dante~,
1898, p. 65 (^Una vendetta in Firenze~).

	|1.  Diverse~, `strange': cf. XXII, 10; XXIV, 83. 

	|2.  Luci~, `eyes.' 

	|3.  Vaghe~, `eager.' 

	|4.  Che pur guate~, `why dost thou naught but stare?'  Cf.
V, 19. 

	|5.  Si soffolge~, `rests.'  A mysterious verb. 

	|6.  Smozzicate~, `mutilated.' 

	|8.  Annoverar~, `count.' 

	|9.~  We learn from XXX, 86, that the 10th and last ^bolgia~
is eleven miles in circumference.  These figures do not afford a
clue for any further computations; they give, however, an
impression of exactness, and they indicate a near approach to the
centre of the earth; furthermore, they suggest by contrast the
vast dimensions of the upper circles.  The number 22 was one that
would naturally occur to Dante in speaking of a circle, because
the relation of circumference to diameter was expressed by the
ratio of 22 to 7. 

	|10.~  The moon being under their feet, the sun must be 
over their heads: it is about noon in Jerusalem. 

	|15.  Dimesso~, `granted.' 

	|16.  Parte~, `while.'  The |e~ is untranslatable: cf. XIX,
3.  The construction is: ^Parte se ne g@ia lo duca, (e) io retro
gli andava, gi@a faccendo~, etc. 

	|19.  A posta~, `fixed.' 

	|22.~  `Let not thy thought shatter itself upon him,' like
a missile hurled violently at something hard. 

	|28.  Impedito~, `absorbed.'  ^Altaforte~, or Hautefort 
(Proven$cal ^Autafort~), was the castle of Bertran de Born. 

	|30.  In l@a~, `that way.'  |S@i~, `until': cf. XIX, 44. 

	|33.  Consorte~, `partner': by any of his relatives. 

	|36.~  The thought of Geri's just grievance against him 
makes Dante more compassionate. 

	|38.  De lo~ = ^dallo.~ -- |L' altra valle~: the 10th 
^bolgia.~ 

	|39.~  `(And) if there were more light, (would reveal it) 
quite to the bottom.' 

	|40.  Chiostra~ means `enclosure' and also `cloister'; 
the latter sense suggests the `lay brothers' (^conversi~) of l. 
41. 

	|43.  Diversi~: cf. l. 1. 

	|44.  Ferrati~, `headed,' `pointed.'  |Strali~, `shafts.' 

	|46.~  The |qual~ is correlative with ^tal~ in l. 50.  The
swampy Valdichiana and Maremma (in eastern and western Tuscany)
and the fens of Sardinia were noted haunts of malaria in the hot
season. 

	|48.  Mali~, `diseases.' 

	|49.  Insembre~ = ^insieme.~ 

	|50.  Tal~, sc., ^dolor.~ 

	|51.  De le~ = ^dalle.~ -- |Membre~ = ^membra.~  Cf. 
^calcagne~ in ^Purg.~ XII, 21, and ^vestige~ in ^Purg.~ XXXI, 81.

	|52.  Riva~: the further, inner bank of the 10th and last 
^bolgia.~  The poets climb down, on the left, from the ridge to 
the bank itself; they do not mount the ridge again. 

	|55.  'Ve~ = ^ove.~ 

	|57.  Qui~: on earth. 

	|58.~  Construe: ^Non credo che il popolo tutto infermo 
in Egina fosse maggior tristizia~ (`sadder') ^a veder~...The 
second member of the comparison begins with ^che~ in l. 65.  A 
pest sent by Juno carried off the inhabitants and even the 
animals that occupied the island of Aegina; afterwards, at the
prayer of Aeacus, the sole survivor, Jupiter restored the 
population by turning ants into men: ^Met.~, VII, 518 ff.  Cf. 
^Conv.~, IV, xxvii, 160-8. 

	|66.  Biche~, `stacks': cf. IX, 78. 

	|74.  Tegghia~, `pan.' 

	|75.  Schianze~, `scabs.' 

	|76.  Stregghia~ = ^striglia~, `currycomb.' 

	|77.  Ragazzo~, `stable-boy.'  |Signorso~ = ^signor suo.~ 

	|78.  Vegghia~, `stays awake': one who is in a hurry to 
get to bed. 

	|79.  Morso~, `bite,' i.e., edge. 

	|81.  Pizzicor~, `itching.' 

	|83.  Scardova~, `bream.' 

	|85.  Dismaglie~, `dismailest': cf. V, 19. 

	|88.  Latino~: cf. XXII, 65. 

	|89.  Se l' unghia~, etc.: evidently this constitutes a 
formula of adjuration: cf. X, 82. 

	|95.  Balzo~, `ledge.' 

	|96.  Intendo~, `I am busied.' 

	|97.  Rincalzo~, `support,' of the two invalids who are 
propped against each other, like pans. 

	|99.  Di rimbalzo~, `on the rebound': who caught the words
that were directed at the two lepers. 

	|100.  S' accolse~, `drew close.' 

	|101.  Vuoli~ = ^vuoi.~ 

	|102.  Volse~ = ^volle.~ 

	|103.  S' imboli~ `steal away.'  Ll. 103, 105 contain the 
same construction as l. 89. 

	|109.~  Most of the early commentators give the name of 
the speaker as Griffolino; a `Maestro Griffolino da Arezzo' is 
attested in Bologna in 1259.  See ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIV, 20; 
^Nuovo Giornale dantesco~, II, 29.  Albero da Siena belonged to
a rich and noble family, and was alive as late as 1294; nothing 
more is known of him. 

	|111.~  One of the early commentators, Jacopo della Lana, 
says that Griffolino was burned for heresy.  But what brings him
here is alchemy. 

	|114.  Vaghezza~, `curiosity.' 

	|116.~  Because I did not teach him to fly like Daedalus. 
Cf. XVII, 109. 

	|117.  A tal~, `by a certain man': the early commentators 
say it was the bishop of Siena.  The latter part of the line 
probably means: `who loved him (Albero) as a son.' 

	|120.  Lece~, `it is permitted.' 

	|122.  Vana~ `silly.'  The foolishness of the Sienese was 
a standing joke in the rival city of Florence.  A headless nail 
is there called a ^chiodo senese.~ 

	|124.~  We learn in l. 136 that `the other leper' is 
Capocchio.  |Intese~, `heard.' 

	|125.  Tra' mene~, `except': evidently ironical. 
|Stricca~: probably Giovanni Stricca de' Salimbeni, mayor of 
Bologna in 1276 and 1286. 

	|127.  Niccol@o~, said to be a brother of Stricca. 
Capocchio calls him the inventor of the `costly fashion of the 
clove,' that is, apparently, the one who introduced into Siena 
the use of cloves as a spice.  Cloves, which were imported from 
the East, paid a heavy duty. 

	|129.~  `The garden where such seed takes root' is Siena, 
where a foolish custom, once started, is bound to thrive. 

	|130.~  Excepting also the ^brigata spendereccia~, or 
Spendthrifts' Club, recorded from 1260 to 1275, a group of young
men who vied with one another in extravagance.  |Disperse~, 
`squandered.' 

	|131.  Caccia d' Ascian~ is perhaps the poet known as 
Caccia da Siena.  |Vigna~, `vineyards.'  |Fronda~, `forests.' 

	|132.  L' Abbagliato~: a nickname of Bartolommeo 
Folcacchieri, a brother of the poet Folcacchiero.  He held 
important offices, and lived as late as 1300.  |Proferse~, 
`displayed.'  This line may be ironical, as it is generally 
taken, or it may be that Bartolommeo vainly tried to suppress the
Club: see ^Giorn. dant.~, XXII, 65. 

	|136.~  Capocchio was burned alive in Siena in 1293. 

	|138.  Se ben t' adocchio~, `if I descry thee aright': if 
thou art really the man I think. 

	|139.  Scimia~ = ^scimmia~, `ape.'
