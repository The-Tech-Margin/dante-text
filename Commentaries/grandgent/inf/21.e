	|Proemio.~ IN nearly all mediaeval portrayals of the lower
world the grotesque runs riot.  Dante, while not discarding
this element, has brought it within narrow bounds.  In
the fifth ^bolgia~, however, he gives free rein to
the comic spirit, which dominates this canto and the
next.  Here, too, he reflects, as nowhere else, the popular
Christian conception of Hell.  As in the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~,
a
devil arrives carrying a lost soul, -- although the damned,
according to Dante's regular plan, should sink unaided to
their
proper place by the weight of their own sin.  The guardians of
this ditch are the roguish fiends of folklore; they are more
or
less individualized, receiving fantastic names.  Their generic
designation is ^Malebranche~, 'Badpaws'; ^Alichino~ is perhaps
the French ^Hallequin~, leader of the Wild Hunt; ^Farfarello~
seems to be a traditional demon-name; ^Barbariccia~,
^Cagnazzo~,
^Graffiacane~, ^Malacoda~, ^Rubicante~ mean respectively
'Curlybeard,' 'Mean Dog,' 'Dogscratcher,' 'Badtail,'
'Rubicund.' 
Some of the appellations appear to be ludicrous distortions of
the names of real people: there was a prominent Malabranca
family
in Rome; the Raffacani were numerous in Florence; a Pietro di
Malacoda is attested; and Torraca cites, among others,
Canasso,
Scaldabrina, Ciriolo, Dragonetto, Biccicocco, Sc@ormiglio,
which
are not unlike ^Cagnazzo~, ^Calcabrina~, ^Ciriatto~,
^Draghignazzo~,
^Libicocco~, ^Scarmiglione.~  The whole humorous interlude,
characterized by coarseness of incident and language, serves
both
to express contempt for the sinners and their earthly judges,
and
to afford a relief from the horrors that precede and follow.

	The peculiarity of swindlers is that they do dirty work
in the dark; and unless they remain under cover, they are
seized
by the officers of the law.  So Dante's barrators, or
grafters,
pursue their eternal career beneath the surface of a ditch
full
of boiling pitch, and demons stand ready to snatch them with
hooks if they attempt to 'air themselves.'  Cunning as they
were
on earth, they still incessantly scheme to cheat and elude
their
watchers; and these, just as tricky and far more vile and
mischievous, are as eager to catch the innocent as the guilty. 
Dante himself barely evades their wiles, even Reason being
temporarily deceived, though human instinct is apprehensive. 
The
poet here introduces a bit of autobiography.  It will be
remembered that in 1302 he was accused (as a pretext for
reprisal) of several crimes, among them barratry committed
when
he was prior, in 1300; and was condemned to death by fire if
taken in Florentine territory.  In reality, then, as in the
^Comedy~, he had a narrow escape from infernal machinations. 
The
mention of the pitch leads to a lifelike description of the
great
arsenal, or shipyard, in Venice, famous during and after the
Middle Ages where the sailors, as is the habit of seafaring
folk
the world over, utilize the enforced idleness of winter to
repair
their damaged craft.

	To entrap Dante and his too confiding guide, the leader
of the Malebranche informs them that though the nearest bridge
over the following valley is broken, the next ridge will
afford
them a safe passage.  This arch was shattered, he says, when
Christ descended into Hell, 1266 years ago yesterday, and five
hours later in the day.  Now Dante, in ^Conv.~, IV, xxiii,
92-110,
after expressing the opinion that the age of thirty-five is
the culminating point of the perfect human life, continues: 'E
movemi questa ragione, che ottimamente naturato fue il nostro
Salvadore Cristo, il quale volle morire nel trentaquattresimo
anno della sua etade; ch@e non era convenevole la Divinit@a
stare
cos@i in discrescere.  N@e da credere @e ch'Egli non volesse
dimorare in questa nostra vita al sommo, poich@e stato c'era
nel
basso stato della puerizia.  E ci@o ne manifesta l'ora del
giorno della sua morte, ch@e volle quella consomigliare colla
vita sua; onde dice Luca che era quasi ora sesta quando
mor@io,
che @e a dire lo colmo del d@i.  Onde si pu@o comprendere per
quello quasi che al trentacinquesimo anno di Cristo era il
colmo
della sua et@a.'  Not only is this argument curiously lame,
but
its very foundation is false, for Luke does not state that
'era
quasi ora sesta' when Christ died.  What he does say (xxiii,
44-5),
after recording the conversation between Jesus and the thief,
is: 'And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
over all the earth until the ninth hour.  And the sun was
darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.' 
Matthew (xxvii 45,46,51) and Mark (xv 33, 34, 38) agree in
putting the crucifixion and the beginning of the darkness at
the
sixth hour (noon), the death and the rending of the veil of
the
temple at the ninth (3 P.M.); and there is nothing in Luke's
vaguer statement that is inconsistent with this.  If Dante
when
he wrote Canto XXI, still adhered to the opinion set forth in
the
^Convivio~, the colloquy between Virgil and the fiend occurred
at
7 A.M., five hours before noon; if, on the other hand, he had
rejected this untenable view, the hour was 10 A.M.  It was, in
any case, the morning of Saturday, April 9, the day following
Good Friday, in the year 1300, counting from the Conception --
1266 years after the death of Christ, who expired, according
to
Dante's belief, at the age of thirty-three, just thirty-four
years after the Conception.  For the devils' names, see
E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, XXIII, 25 ff.

	|41.  Fuor che Bonturo~ is ironical: Bonturo Dati, boss of
Lucca, was the worst grafter of all; in 1300 he was at the height
of his power.  In 1308 he was leader of a triumvirate that
controlled Lucca.  That is the year in which a document in Lucca
was witnessed by `Johannes filius Dantis Alagherii de Florentia.'
Possibly Dante was there that year under the protection of 
Moroello Malaspina.  Of this `Johannes' nothing more is known.
