	|1-3.  Osanna, sanctus Deus~... |malac@oth~: "`Hail, holy
God of hosts, doubly illumining with thy brightness the happy
fires of these kingdoms.'  The blessed souls -- `happy fires' of
the heavens -- are illumined first by their own intelligence and
secondly by God's grace.  -- Of the three Hebrew words mixed with
the Latin, |osanna~ and |saba@oth~ are used in the Bible, and
|malac@oth~ (a mistake for ^mamlacoth~) occurs in St. Jerome's
preface to the Vulgate called ^Prologus Galeatus~, where it is
said to be equivalent to ^regnorum~, `of kingdoms'" (Gr).

	|5.  fu viso a me~ = ^fu visto da me.~  Cf. the Latin
^visum est mihi.~  |essa sustanza~: Justinian.

	|6.  doppio lume~: Dante is probably referring here to
the double light of natural intelligence and illuminating grace. 
There are, however, several other interpretations of the meaning,
such as "the light of his beatitude doubled by that of his joy in
enlightening Dante" (Norton).  See ^Par.~ V, 131-137. 
|s'addua~: "Is twinned."  For this unusual type of verb, invented
by Dante, cf. ^s'incinqua~ (^Par.~ IX, 40) and ^s'intrea~
(^Par.~ XIII, 57).

	|7.  ed essa e l'altre mossero a sua danza~: The lights
now join in one dance.  |sua~ = ^loro.~

	|9.  mi si velar di s@ubita distanza~: The souls return to
the Empyrean, their abode.  |velar~ = ^velarono.~

	|10-12.  Io dubitava~... |stille~: Another question has
now arisen in Dante's mind, and he addresses himself in his own
thoughts.  |Dille~ ("tell her") is used repeatedly to convey the
urgency Dante feels within himself to have his thirst quenched by
his lady (Beatrice), who does this, time and again, with the
"sweet drops" of the truth.

	|14.  per Be e per  ice~: "Be is the name of the letter
^b~, ^ice~ is the rest of the name Bice, the shortened form of
^Beatrice.~  Dante is filled with reverence at the thought of the
mere earthly Beatrice, and the name by which she was called: how
much more reverent must he be in the presence of the heavenly
Beatrice, whose full name occurs two lines below!  The usual
Tuscan name of ^b~ is ^bi~; ^be~, however, is Aretine" (Gr).

	|16.  Poco sofferse me cotal Beatrice~: "Beatrice allowed
me to remain thus [with bowed head] but a little while."  |Me
cotal~ reflects a Latin construction.

	|18.  faria~ = ^farebbe.~

	|19-21.  Secondo mio infallibile~... |miso~: No reader
will forget that Beatrice can always read Dante's thoughts, which
she now proceeds to do, stating that in this she is infallible. 
For the problem that has arisen with Dante, cf. ^Par.~ VI,
88-93.  |miso~ = ^messo.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI, 54.

	|24.  sentenza~: "Doctrine."  |presente~: "Gift."

	|25.  Per non soffrire~: "Because he would not endure." 
|la virt@u che vole~: The will.

	|26.  freno~: The object of "soffrire."  |a suo prode~:
"For his own profit."  |quell'uom che non nacque~: Adam.  Dante
delights in naming Adam by circumlocution.  Cf. ^Par.~ XIII,
37-39; XXVI, 91-92.

	|27.  dannando s$e, dann@o tutta sua prole~: Thus was the
burden of original sin transmitted to all mankind.  This is
well-established doctrine, of course, as is that expressed in the
following tercet.

	|28-33.  onde l'umana specie~... |amore~:  The statement 
of this standard doctrine continues.  Adam's sin left all his progeny 
"wounded" (|inferma~) in intellect and in will.  Fallen man is 
wounded in these two faculties of his immortal soul.  See n. to 
^Inf.~ I, 30.

	|29.  gi@u per secoli molti~: |Gi@u~ bears the suggestion
that man was abandoned, left "below," by God, ^sibi relictus~ as
the theologians commonly phrase it.  We learn later (^Par.~
XXVI, 118-123), from Adam himself, that 5,232 years passed
between the creation of Adam and the Crucifixion, which means
that man lay below in error for more than fifty centuries before
the Incarnation.

	|30.  Verbo di Dio~: Christ.  Cf. Ioan. 1:1.

	|31.  u'~ = ^ove~, "where," i.e., to mankind.  |natura~:
The object of ^un@i~ (vs. 32).

	|32-33.  s'era allungata~: This stresses the force of
|gi@u~ (see n. to vs. 29).   |un@i a s$e in persona~: The divine
Christ assumed human nature, uniting it to Himself in the mystery
of the Incarnation.  And this was an act of pure love.  See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 32, a. 1, resp., where
one is reminded that "conceptionem corporis Christi tota Trinitas
est operata.  Attribuitur tamen hoc Spiritui sancto."  ("The
whole Trinity effected the conception of Christ's body:
nevertheless, this is attributed to the Holy Ghost.")  And the
Holy Ghost is eternal Love.  See also ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 32,
a. 4, ad 1:

     Illa conceptio tria privilegia habuit: scilicet quod esset
     sine peccato originali; quod esset non puri hominis, sed Dei
     et hominis; item quod esset conceptio virginis: et haec
     tria habuit a Spiritu sancto.  Et ideo dicit Damascenus
     quantum ad primum, quod Spiritus sanctus supervenit Virgini
     purgans ipsam, idest, praeservans, ne cum peccato originali
     conciperet.

     This conception had three privileges -- namely, that it was
     without original sin; that it was not that of a man only,
     but of God and man; and that it was a virginal conception.
     And all three were effected by the Holy Ghost.  Therefore
     Damascene says, as to the first, that the Holy Ghost ^came~
     ^upon the Virgin, purifying her~ -- that is, preserving her
     from conceiving with original sin.

	|35-36.  questa natura~... |buona~: Human nature as it
was in Adam before the Fall, "united to its Creator," was pure
and good.

	|37-39.  ma per s$e~... |paradiso~: Adam sinned by an act
of his own free will, and the consequence thereof was his (and
Eve's) banishment from Eden (|paradiso~ here is used in the sense
of the earthly Paradise).  |per@o che~ = ^perci@o che.~  |si
torse~... |vita~: Original sin turned human nature from the way
of truth and from a perfect life in Eden.

	|40-42.  La pena~... |morse~: Christ assumed human nature
in order to purge it, or heal it, by that assumption.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 31, a. 1, resp.:

     Christus humanam naturam assumpsit, ut eam a corruptione
     purgaret.  Non autem purgatione indigebat natura humana nisi
     secundum quod infecta erat per originem vitiatam, qua ex
     Adam descendebat.  Et ideo conveniens fuit ut carnem sumeret
     ex materia ab Adam derivata, ut ipsa natura per assumptionem
     curaretur.

     Christ assumed human nature in order to cleanse it of
     corruption.  But human nature did not need to be cleansed
     save in as far as it was soiled in its tainted origin
     whereby it was descended from Adam.  Therefore it was
     becoming that He should assume flesh of matter derived from
     Adam, that the nature itself might be healed by the
     assumption.

Christ's death on the Cross therefore ^justly~ atoned for
original sin in Adam.  Nothing was ever so just.

	|43-45.  e cos@i nulla~... |natura~: Christ on earth was
God, second person of the Trinity, who had assumed corrupt human
nature.  But He remained God, hence the Jews nailed God to the
Cross.  And they are responsible.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ III, q. 46, a. 12, ad 3, where Aquinas is quoting a
sermon of the Council of Ephesus:

     Sicut subditur ibidem, ^non purum hominem crucifixerunt~
     ^Iudaei, sed Deo intulerunt praesumptiones.  Pone enim~
     ^principem loqui per verbum, et hoc formari per litteras~
     ^in charta aliqua, et dirigi civitatibus, et aliquis~
     ^inobediens chartam disrumpat; ad mortis sententiam~
     ^deducetur, non tamquam chartam disrumpens, sed tamquam~
     ^verbum imperiale disrumpens.  Non ergo securus sit~
     ^Iudaeus, tamquam purum hominem crucifigens; quod enim~
     ^videbat, quasi charta erat; quod autem in ea celabatur~,
     ^imperiale Verbum erat, natum ex natura, non prolatum per~
     ^linguam.~

     As the passage quoted goes on to say: ^The Jews did not~
     ^crucify one who was simply a man; they inflicted their~
     ^presumptions upon God.  For suppose a prince to speak by~
     ^word of mouth, and that his words are committed to writing~
     ^on a parchment and sent out to the cities, and that some~
     ^rebel tears up the document, he will be led forth to~
     ^endure the death sentence, not for merely tearing up a~
     ^document, but as destroying the imperial message.  Let not~
     ^the Jew, then, stand in security, as crucifying a mere~
     ^man; since what he saw was as the parchment, but what was~
     ^hidden under it was the imperial Word, the Son by nature~,
     ^not the mere utterance of a tongue.~

Thus, says Dante, "considering the [divine] person who suffered
crucifixion at their hands, never was there a greater outrage."

	|46-47.  Per@o~... |morte~: The second verse explains the
first.  It pleased God that Christ should die on the Cross (a
point which Beatrice will now explain), and it also pleased the
Jews that he should die thus.  But even though the Crucifixion of
Christ was part of God's plan, the Jews are nonetheless
accountable for their terrible deed.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ III, q. 47, a. 5, resp.:

     Apud Iudaeos quidam erant maiores, et quidem minores.
     ^Maiores~ quidem ^qui eorum principes dicebantur~, ut
     dicitur in lib. QQ. veteris et novi Testam. (quaest. 66, a
     med., inter op. Aug.), ^sicut et daemones cognoverunt eum~
     ^esse Christum promissum in lege: omnia enim signa videbant~
     ^in eo quae dixerunt futura Prophetae; mysterium autem~
     ^divinitatis eius ignorabant.~  Et ideo Apostolus dicit quod
     ^si cognovissent, nunquam Dominum gloriae crucifixissent.~ 
     Sciendum tamen quod eorum ignorantia non eos excusabat a
     crimine, quia erat quodammodo ignorantia affectata: videbant
     enim evidentia signa divinitatis ipsius, sed ex odio, et
     invidia Christi ea pervertebant; et verbis eius, quibus se Dei
     Filium fatebatur, credere noluerunt.  Unde ipse de eis dicit
     Ioan. 15, 22: ^Si non venissem, et locutus eis non~
     ^fuissem, peccatum non haberent; nunc autem excusationem~
     ^non habent de peccato suo.~  Et postea subdit: ^Si opera~
     ^non fecissem in eis, quae nemo alius fecit, peccatum non~
     ^haberent.~  Et sic ex persona eorum accipi potest quod
     dicitur Iob 21, 14: ^Dixerunt Deo: Recede a nobis~,
     ^scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus.~  Minores vero, idest
     populares qui mysteria scripturae non noverant, non plene
     cognoverunt ipsum esse nec Christum, nec Filium Dei.  Licet
     enim aliqui eorum in eum crediderint, multitudo tamen non
     credidit; et si aliquando dubitaverunt an ipse esset
     Christus, propter signorum multitudinem et efficaciam
     doctrinae, ut habetur Ioan. 7, tamen postea decepti fuerunt
     a suis principibus, ut eum non crederent neque Filium Dei,
     neque Christum.  Unde et Petrus eis dixit: ^Scio quia per~
     ^ignorantiam fecistis, sicut et principes vestri~, quia
     scilicet principes seducti erant.

     Among the Jews some were elders, and others of lesser
     degree.  Now according to the author of ^De Qq. Nov. et~
     ^Vet. Test.~, ^qu.~ lxvi, the elders, who were called
     ^rulers~, ^knew~, as did also the devils, ^that He was the~
     ^Christ promised in the Law: for they saw all the signs in~
     ^Him which the prophets said would come to pass: but they~
     ^did not know the mystery of His Godhead.~  Consequently the
     Apostle says: ^If they had known it, they would never have~
     ^crucified the Lord of glory.~  It must, however, be
     understood that their ignorance did not excuse them from
     crime, because it was, as it were, affected ignorance.  For
     they saw manifest signs of His Godhead; yet they perverted
     them out of hatred and envy of Christ; neither would they
     believe His words, whereby He avowed that He was the Son of
     God.  Hence He Himself says of them (Jo. xv. 22): ^If I had~
     ^not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin~;
     ^but now they have no excuse for their sin.~  And afterwards He
     adds (24): ^If I had not done among them the works that no
     ^other man hath done, they would not have sin.~  And so the
     expression employed by Job (xxi, 14) can be accepted on
     their behalf: (^Who~) ^said to God: depart from us, we~
     ^desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.~

       But those of lesser degree -- namely, the common folk -- who
     had not grasped the mysteries of the Scriptures, did not
     fully comprehend that He was the Christ or the Son of God. 
     For although some of them believed in Him, yet the multitude
     did not; and if they doubted sometimes whether He was the
     Christ, on account of the manifold signs and force of His
     teaching, as is stated Jo. vii, 31, 41, nevertheless they
     were deceived afterwards by their rulers, so that they did
     not believe Him to be the Son of God or the Christ.  Hence
     Peter said to them: ^I know that you did it through~
     ^ignorance, as did also your rulers~ -- namely, because
     they were seduced by the rulers.

	|48.  trem@o la terra~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 41.  The
reference is to the earthquake that shook the earth when Christ
died on the Cross (Matt. 27:51).  |e 'l ciel s'aperse~: See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 49, a. 5, resp.:

     Clausio ianuae est obstaculum quoddam prohibens homines ab
     ingressu.  Prohibebantur autem homines ab ingressu regni
     caelestis propter peccatum, quia, sicut dicitur Isa. 35, 8,
     ^Via illa sancta vocabitur, et non transibit per eam~
     ^pollutus.~  Est autem duplex peccatum impediens ab ingressu
     regni caelestis.  Unum quidem commune totius humanae
     naturae, quod est peccatum primi parentis; et per hoc
     peccatum praecludebatur homini aditus regni caelestis.  Unde
     legitur Gen. 3, 24, quod post peccatum primi parentis
     ^collocavit Deus Cherubim et flammeum gladium atque~
     ^versatilem, ad custodiendam viam ligni vitae.~  Aliud autem
     est peccatum speciale uniuscuiusque personae, quod per
     proprium actum committitur uniuscuiusque hominis.  Per
     passionem autem Christi liberati sumus, non solum a peccato
     communi totius humanae naturae, et quantum ad culpam, et
     quantum ad reatum poenae, ipso solvente pretium pro nobis,
     sed etiam a peccatis propriis singulorum, qui communicant
     eius passioni per fidem, et charitatem, et fidei sacramenta. 
     Et ideo per passionem Christi aperta est nobis ianua regni
     caelestis.

     The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders men
     from entering in.  But it is on account of sin that men were
     prevented from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since,
     according to Isa. xxxv, 8: ^It shall be called the holy~
     ^way, and the unclean shall not pass over it.~  Now there
     is a twofold sin which prevents men from entering into the
     kingdom of heaven.  The first is common to the whole race,
     for it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's
     entrance is closed to man.  Hence we read in Gen. iii, 24
     that after our first parents' sin God ^placed~... ^cherubim~
     ^and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of~
     ^the tree of life.~  The other is the personal sin of each one
     of us, committed by our personal act.
       Now by Christ's Passion we have been delivered not only from
     the common sin of the whole human race, both as to its guilt
     and as to the debt of punishment, for which He paid the
     penalty on our behalf; but, furthermore, from the personal
     sins of individuals, who share in His Passion by faith and
     charity and the sacraments of faith.  Consequently, then,
     the gate of heaven's kingdom is thrown open to us through
     Christ's Passion.

	|49.  forte~: "Hard" to understand.

	|50-51.  quando si dice~... |corte~: See vss. 20-21 and
^Par.~ VI, 92-93.  |da giusta corte~: By Titus, i.e., by the
legitimate Roman tribunal, bearing the sign of the imperial
eagle.

	|52-57.  Ma io veggi'~... |modo~: Beatrice, reading
Dante's thoughts, knows that another question, and a knotty one,
has arisen in his mind: Why did God choose ^this~ way, as set
forth above, for the redemption of mankind?  For the theologian's
typical answer, one may continue to turn to Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ III, perhaps choosing q. 46, a. 3, where Aquinas
considers whether there was a more suitable way of delivering the
human race than by Christ's Passion.  In his answer, Aquinas
says:

     Tanto aliquis modus convenientior est ad assequendum finem,
     quanto per ipsum plura concurrunt quae sunt expedientia
     fini.  Per hoc autem quod homo per Christi passionem est
     liberatus, multa concurrerunt ad salutem hominis pertinentia
     praeter liberationem a peccato.  Primo enim per hoc homo
     cognoscit quantum Deus hominem diligat, et per hoc
     provocatur ad eum diligendum, in quo perfectio humanae
     salutis consistit: unde Apostolus dicit Rom. 5, 8:
     ^Commendat suam charitatem Deus in nobis: quoniam cum~
     ^inimici essemus, Christus pro nobis mortuus est.~ 
     Secundo, quia per hoc dedit nobis exemplum obedientiae,
     humilitatis, constantiae, iustitiae et caeterarum virtutum
     in passione Christi ostensarum, quae sunt necessariae ad
     humanam salutem: unde dicitur I Pet. 2, 21: ^Christus~
     ^passus est pro nobis, vobis relinquens exemplum, ut~
     ^sequamini vestigia eius.~  Tertio, quia Christus per
     passionem suam non solum hominem a peccato liberavit, sed etiam
     gratiam iustificantem et gloriam beatitudinis ei promeruit,
     ut infra dicetur, quaest. 48.  Quarto, quia per hoc est
     homini inducta major necessitas se immunem a peccato
     conservandi... secundum illud I Corinth. 6, 20: ^Empti enim~
     ^estis pretio magno: glorificate et portate Deum in corpore~
     ^vestro.~  Quinto, quia hoc ad majorem dignitatem hominis
     cessit, ut sicut homo victus fuerat et deceptus a diabolo,
     ita etiam homo esset qui diabolum vinceret; et sicut homo
     mortem meruit, ita homo moriendo mortem superaret.  Unde
     dicitur 1 ad Corinth. 15, 57: ^Deo gratias, qui dedit~
     ^nobis victoriam per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum.~  Et
     ideo convenientius fuit quod per passionem Christi
     liberaremur quam per solam Dei voluntatem.

     Among means to an end that one is the more suitable whereby
     the various concurring means employed are themselves helpful
     to such end.  But in this that man was delivered by Christ's
     Passion, many other things besides deliverance from sin
     concurred for man's salvation.  In the first place, man
     knows thereby how much God loves him, and is thereby stirred
     to love Him in return, and herein lies the perfection of
     human salvation; hence the Apostle says (Rom. V, 8 [9]):
     ^God commendeth His charity towards us; for when as yet we~
     ^were sinners~...  ^Christ died for us.~  Secondly, because
     thereby He set us an example of obedience, humility,
     constancy, justice, and the other virtues displayed in the
     Passion, which are requisite for man's salvation.  Hence it
     is written (I Pet. ii, 21): ^Christ also suffered for us~,
     ^leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps.~ 
     Thirdly, because Christ by His Passion not only delivered
     man from sin, but also merited justifying grace for him and
     the glory of bliss, as shall be shown later (q. 48, a. 1; q.
     49, aa. 1, 5).  Fourthly, because by this man is all the
     more bound to refrain from sin, according to I Cor. vi, 20:
     ^You are bought with a great price: glorify and bear God~
     ^in your body.~  Fifthly, because it redounded to man's
     greater dignity, that as man was overcome and deceived by
     the devil, so also it should be a man that should overthrow
     the devil; and as man deserved death, so a man by dying
     should vanquish death.  Hence it is written (I Cor. xv, 57):
     ^Thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through~
     ^our Lord Jesus Christ.~  It was accordingly more fitting
     that we should be delivered by Christ's Passion than simply
     by God's good-will.

	|58.  frate~: The reader will note the admonitory tone of
this word.  Cf. ^Purg.~ IV, 127; XI, 82; ^Par.~ III, 70.

	|60.  adulto~: "`Full-grown' in the flame of love.  Only
an infinitely loving mind can comprehend the boundless love which
impelled God to sacrifice himself for man" (Gr).

	|61.  Veramente~: "However."  |segno~: "Target," i.e.,
this problem.

	|63.  perch$e tal modo fu pi@u degno~: Thus the argument is
now couched in terms of ^suitability~, even as Thomas Aquinas
frames it in ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 46, a. 3.

	|64-66.  La divina bont@a~... |etterne~: "Divine Goodness,
in its exuberant love, brings forth men and angels, just as a
blazing fire sends out sparks.  Thus it `reveals its eternal
beauties,' by giving them a visible, objective form in the
created world.  Cf. ^Cons.~ III, Metr. ix, ll. 4-6 (Boethius is
addressing the Creator):

     Quem non externae pepulerunt fingere causae
     Materiae fluitantis opus, verum insita summi
     Forma boni, livore carens.

     (No external causes impelled You to make this work from
     chaotic matter.  Rather it was the form of the highest good,
     existing within You without envy.)"  (Gr).

On the matter of the resemblance of God's creatures to Himself,
E. G. Gardner (1913, pp. 106-107) notes that Dionysius and
Aquinas echo Plato's ^Timaeus~ (XXIX).

	|67.  sanza mezzo~: "Immediately," "without intermediary
or secondary causes."  |distilla~: "Derives."

	|70-72.  Ci@o che da essa~... |nove~: The meaning of
|libero @e tutto~ is explained by the clause that follows.  That
which is created directly by God is not subject to the power or
influence of more recent things, of the heavens and their
"secondary" causality -- it is not subject to nature, in short. 
The heavens are "recent" compared to their Creator.  |piove~:
|Piove~ repeats the idea of ^distilla~ (vs. 67), both verbs
suggesting a descent of power from above, from God.

	|73.  Pi@u l'@e conforme, e per@o pi@u le piace~: The created
thing is more like God and hence more pleasing to Him.

	|74-75.  ch$e l'ardor santo~... |vivace~: God's love
shines in all things (cf. ^Par.~ I, 1-3), but it is most
resplendent in those creatures (angels and men) which are more
like Himself.

	|76.  dote~: Plural of ^dota~, meaning "gifts,"
"endowments," in this case immortality and liberty, which make
the human creature more like God. |s'avvantaggia~: "Has the
advantage" over lesser things.  And this advantage is man's
"nobility," as it is termed in vs. 78.

	|77-78.  s'una manca~... |caggia~: The human creature
needs must fall from its nobility (freedom), if it loses any one
of its "advantages" or special endowments.  |caggia~ = ^cada.~

	|79.  Solo il peccato @e quel che la disfranca~: Sin alone
"disfranchises," i.e., takes away the God-given privilege.

	|80.  falla~ = ^la fa.~  |dissim@ile al sommo bene~: When
the special "gift" (liberty) is lost, the human creature is less
like God.  This special gift includes reason, of course, which
beasts do not have.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II,
q. 64, a. 2, ad 3: "Homo peccando ab ordine rationis recedit; et
ideo decidit a dignitate humana, prout scilicet homo est
naturaliter liber, et propter seipsum existens; et incidit
quodammodo in servitutem bestiarum."  ("By sinning man departs
from the order of reason, and consequently falls away from the
dignity of his manhood, in so far as he is naturally free, and
exists for himself, and he falls into the slavish state of the
beasts.")

	|81.  per che~: "Wherefore."  |del lume suo poco
s'imbianca~: This obviously returns to the metaphor of light with
which Beatrice's discourse on this problem began (vss. 64-66).

	|82-84.  e in sua dignit@a~... |pene~: The argument
continues in terms of a "dignity" that is lost through sin, which
"disfranchises."  As is already clear -- and will become clearer
-- Beatrice is speaking of the sin of Adam and Eve and its
consequences for human nature.  Thus, in vs. 87 "paradiso" is
used to mean the earthly Paradise.  The burden of expiation for
sin is man's.  Justice would require that he make amends, by
"refilling where he had emptied," by suffering penalties equal to
the sin (^mal dilettar~).

	|85-87.  Vostra natura~... |suo~: It is important to note
that the matter is kept in terms of human nature sinning when
Adam, our seed, sinned.  We were all in Adam (as in our seed)
when Adam sinned, we all sinned when Adam sinned, that is, human
nature sinned when Adam sinned.  It is in this context that
theology speaks of natural justice as the perfect condition lost
when Adam sinned.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 222-253,
especially pp. 230-231.  |tota~ = ^tutta.~  |Tota~ is a Latinism. 
|da queste dignitadi~... |remota~: The condition of original
justice was lost, human nature was removed from that condition,
even as it was in our first parents when they were driven from
the earthly Paradise.

	|88-90.  n$e ricovrar potiensi~... |guadi~: The dignities
lost by Adam's sin could not be regained except by (one or the
other of) two ways (literally, "fords").  Beatrice's logic is
very strict here.

	|91-93.  o che Dio solo~... |avesse~: One way or "ford"
was this: God, through His mercy (|cortesia~), might simply have
forgiven the sin of Adam.  |dimesso~: "Forgiven."  |Dimesso~ is
from the Latin ^dimittere~, used here in the sense it has in the
Bible.  |per s$e isso~: From the Latin ^per se ipsum~, "by
himself."  |O che l'uom~... |follia~: The other way would have
been for man to make satisfaction for his sin.

	|94-95.  mo~ = ^ora.~  |l'abisso de l'etterno consiglio~:
The infinite depths of God's eternal counsel (wisdom).  Cf.
^Purg.~ VI, 121-122.  Beatrice will now solve the dilemma,
knowing God's ways, for she sees very deeply into that abyss,
being herself Wisdom (in allegory).

	|96.  distrettamente~ = ^ben strettamente.~

	|97-100.  Non potea l'uomo~... |sodisfar~: The argument
proceeds by looking first at the possibility of man's making
amends himself for his sin, a possibility that was nil, for the
reason now to be stated.  |per non potere~... |suso~: Beatrice
now goes on to explain that man himself could not atone for his
sin because he was unable to descend in humility to the extent
that he had once aspired to rise.  Adam's sin is thus put
essentially in terms of his and Eve's aspiration to be as gods,
according to the serpent's promise, if they should eat of the
forbidden fruit.  See Gen. 3:4-5: "Dixit autem serpens ad
mulierem: Nequaquam morte moriemini; scit enim Deus quod in
quocumque die comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi vestri, et
eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum."  ("But the serpent
said to the woman, `No, you shall not die; for God knows that
when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like
God, knowing good and evil.'")  Adam's sin was one of
disobedience and pride, an aspiration to rise up and be like God. 
Beatrice, with |ir suso~ and with |disobediendo~, puts the matter
in these terms.  |con umiltate~: The needful compensatory descent
is a descent to humility, which is the opposite of the prideful
aspiration of our first parents.  |quanto disobediendo intese ir
suso~: Adam and Eve could not actually have risen up to be like
God, as the serpent had promised.  But their sin is measured by
the degree (|quanto~) of their intention or aspiration in this
regard (hence, |intese~).  Note that the statement is made in
terms of man in general (rather than of Adam the individual),
which keeps it in terms of human nature.  Man could not, by his
own powers, make satisfaction for original sin.

	|102.  dischiuso~ = ^escluso.~

	|103-104.  Dunque a Dio~... |vita~: "Man cannot,
therefore God must" is the turn the argument now takes.  |con le
vie sue~: God's two ways are mercy and justice.  Cf. Ps. 24
[25]:10: "Universae viae Domini misericordia et veritas
requirentibus testamentum eius et testimonia eius."  ("All the
paths of the Lord are [mercy and justice] toward those who keep
his covenant and his decrees.")  |riparar l'omo a sua intera
vita~: Restore man to the rectitude he had in Eden and lost
through sin.

	|105.  dico con l'una, o ver con amendue~: Either God
could have excused man for original sin or He could have found
some other way.  |con l'una~: That is, ^via~, i.e., either with
mercy or with justice.  |o ver con amendue~: Or with both mercy
and justice.

	|106-107.  ovra~ = ^opera.~  |@e pi@u gradita da
l'operante~: "Is the more pleasing to the one who performs it." 
|appresenta~: "Demonstrates," "manifests."

	|111.  a rilevarvi~: Continuing in the figure of "up and
down," Beatrice means mankind by the pronoun -|vi.~  This will
come to mean, as she continues, that in this way God made it
possible for man to "raise himself" (vs. 116).

	|112.  ultima notte~: Judgment.  |primo die~: The
Creation (cf. Matt. 24:21).  The inverted order is a minor
example of the figure of ^hysteron proteron~ (see ^Par.~ II,
23-24, and the corresponding note).  Here Beatrice's words survey
the whole of the divine economy from the end, as it were.

	|113.  processo~ = ^procedimento.~

	|114.  o per l'una o per l'altra~: I.e., ^via.~  |fie~ =
^sar@a.~

	|115.  pi@u largo fu Dio~: The goodness of God in choosing
this way (vs. 108) continues to be the central point.  Cf. vs.
91: ^cortesia.~  |a dar s$e stesso~: The Father giving the Son,
second person of the Trinity, who in His sacrifice obeyed the
Father.

	|116.  per far l'uom sufficiente a rilevarsi~: The
possibility for an individual man to "raise himself" to salvation
was thus established through Christ's sacrifice.  This stress on
the possibility of man's cooperation should be noted.

	|117.  che s'elli avesse sol da s$e dimesso~: This was the
other way or "ford" (vss. 90-93), the one which God did not
choose.  |elli~ = ^egli.~

	|118-119.  e tutti~... |giustizia~: Justice remains the
keynote, though mercy (God's other way) is not obscured by this.

	|120.  non fosse umiliato ad incarnarsi~: Christ's very
Incarnation is viewed as a humiliation, God becoming man being
the great descent that opened the way to heaven, by making it
possible for man to descend low enough.  But the greatest
humiliation was death on the Cross.  Cf. Phil. 2:8, where it
is said that Christ, appearing as a man, "humiliavit semetipsum
factus obediens usque ad mortem, mortem autem crucis" ("humbled
himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross").

     At this point, the reader should pause to consider that
descent before ascent, a master pattern of Christian thought, is
the basic conceptual necessity of the whole journey through Hell,
up to the girding-on of the rush of humility when the wayfaring
Dante reaches the shore of Mount Purgatory.  On this pattern,
generally overlooked in Dante studies, see C. S. Singleton
(1966), pp. 75-79.

	|122.  in alcun loco~: This "certain place" is the
distinction be tween direct creation by God and formation through
intermediary or secondary causes (vss. 67-72).

	|123.  veggi~ = ^vegga, veda.~

	|124-125.  Tu dici~... |terra~: Beatrice thus names the
four elements that make up the sublunar world.  |e tutte lor
misture~: All that which is formed by the various combinations of
these elements.

	|126.  venire a corruzione, e durar poco~: This ^seems~
to contradict what Beatrice has said previously (vss. 67-72), but
she will now explain.

	|127.  e queste cose pur furon creature~: The tense of
the verb, in the past abolute, is significant, suggesting that
God might have created the elements and their mixtures in His
original creation.  In that case they should be incorruptible
(vs. 129).

	|129.  dovrien~ = ^dovrebbero.~

	|130-132.  Li angeli~... |intero~: A typical use of
|frate~ may be noted here (see n. to ^Par.~ III, 70).  Dante is
now being admonished to correct his thinking, for he ought to
know that God in His original creation made the angels and the
heavens or heavenly spheres, the "country" in which Dante now
finds himself (cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 32-33, 35-36).  And these were
created entire, i.e., in their complete being, without further
change or modification (|in loro essere intero~).

	|133-141.  ma li alimenti~... |sante~: As stated in vss.
136-138 brute matter (|la materia ch'elli hanno~) and the
informing virtue which the heavenly spheres shed on the sublunar
world were also created in God's first creation (cf. ^Par.~
XXIX, 22-24).  But the four elements named and their "mixtures"
(vss. 124-125) are formed indirectly by operation of the
informing virtues of the spheres, the planets, and the stars,
over which the angelic Intelligences preside (see ^Par.~ II,
112-138).  These things, therefore, are not created directly by
God, and this is the main point (see vss. 67-72).  "The ^prima
materia~ is ^informed~ (i.e. so combined with a `form' or ideal
and essential principle as to pass from the possibility of being
^anything~ to the actuality of being ^something~) not direct by
God, but by created powers, i.e. angels or heavenly influences. 
The transforming and vivifying power of the sun (and in lesser
degree the moon) was supposed to have its analogies in equally
real but less obvious influences of the other heavenly bodies,
especially the planets.  It is these heavenly influences
collectively that draw the `soul' or ^life~ of plant (nutritive
and reproductive) or animal (sensitive and locomotive) from the
stage of potentiality in the germinal material into that of
actuality in the living things itself" (TC).  |L'anima d'ogne
bruto e de le piante~: For the conception of the souls which
animals and plants have (the sensitive and the vegetative
respectively), see ^Purg.~ XV, 52-60, and the corresponding
notes.  |complession potenziata~: The terminology continues to be
primarily Aristotelian as in so many other passages in the
^Paradiso.~

	|142-144.  ma vostra vita~... |disira~: Compare ^Purg.~
XXV, especially vss. 70-75, where it is explained that God
breathes the immortal soul into the fully formed fetus.  Thus
each human soul is created directly by God.  Moreover, this
loving God inspires each soul with a love and desire for Himself
(natural love).

	|145-148.  E quinci~... |fensi~: "I.e. `from the
distinctions now drawn'; for the bodies both of Adam and Eve were
made immediately by God, and when the work of redemption is
finally consummated (after the last judgment) man's body will be
restored to the dignity which it lost only by sin.  The argument
is Anselm's.  He meets the obvious objection that it does not
cover the case of the `resurrection unto wrath,' by urging that
if the saved rejoice both in body and soul, it is but fitting
that the lost should suffer in both" (TC).

	|145.  quinci~: "Hence."

	|147.  fessi~ = ^si fece.~

	|148.  fensi~ = ^si fecero.~
