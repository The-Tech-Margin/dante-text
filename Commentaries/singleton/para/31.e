	|1.  candida~: See ^Par.~ XXX, 129, the ^convento de le
bianche stole.~  The adjective can also suggest the noun
^candore~, which in itself connotes a "glowing."  Cf. ^Par.~
XIV, 37-39, and "candente" in ^Par.~ XIV, 77.  |candida rosa~:
"The figure of the rose seems to be Dante's own, although
Paradise is sometimes represented in roselike form in early
Italian art.  The rose, too, was sometimes used as a symbol of
the Passion.  On the fourth Sunday of Lent, the Pope blesses a
gold rose (`rosa aurea mixta cum balsamo et musco'), with a
ceremonial that indicates an association of this flower with
Christ and Heaven: see G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l'ordine del
`Paradiso' dantesco~, I, 1911, 233-238.  The Old French ^Roman de
la Rose~, the great literary success of the 13th century, made
all western Europe familiar with the rose as a symbol of earthly
love; Dante's white flower is the rose of Heavenly love.  It may
be that a sight of the Roman Coliseum influenced his conception
of the great amphitheater of Paradise (cf. Busnelli, I, 239-242). 
The figure of the rose is also an homage to Mary, who presides in
the assembly.  See Albertus Magnus, ^De laud. b. Mariae
Virginis~, XII, iv, 33: `Et nota, quod Christus rosa, Maria rosa,
Ecclesia rosa, fidelis anima rosa'.  [`And note that Christ is a
rose, Mary is a rose, the Church is a rose, the faithful soul is
a rose.']" (Gr).

	|2.  la milizia santa~: Cf. ^Par.~ XXX, 43.

	|3.  nel suo sangue Cristo fece sposa~: Cf. Actus, 20:28:
"Attendite vobis et universo gregi in quo vos Spiritus Sanctus
posuit episcopos regere ecclesiam Dei, quam acquisivit sanguine
suo."  ("Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock in which
the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops, to rule the Church of
God, which he has purchased with his own blood.")

	|4.  l'altra~: I.e., the ^milizia~ {v.2}, the angels.

	|5.  la gloria di colui che la `nnamora~: Love is
stressed here, as it is in the verses that recount the creation
of the angels (see ^Par.~ XXIX, 18).  But the ^seeing~ which
precedes love is indicated by the ^vede~ of the preceding
verse.  See ^Par.~ XXVIII, 109-111.

	|6.  la fece cotanta~: See ^Par.~ XXIX, 59-60.

	|7.  ape~ = ^api.~  |Ape~ is from the Latin ^apes.~ 
|s'infiora~: "Enflowers itself," dips into flowers.  The simile
of bees and flowers is first suggested as part of the ^umbriferi
prefazi~ (^Par.~ XXX, 78) seen by Dante in this last heaven (see
^Par.~ XXX, 64-65).

	|8.  e una~: I.e., ^e un'altra volta.~  |si ritorna~:
Chimenz notes that this is the pleonastic reflexive, as indeed it
is, in its distancing function.


	|9.  l@a~: To the hive.  |s'insapora~: "Turns savory," the
nectar being changed to honey.

	|11-12.  foglie~: "Petals," i.e., the blessed in their
thrones in the great amphitheater.  |quindi~: "From there," i.e.,
from the rose.  |quindi risaliva~... |soggiorna~: The angels'
love is God, who so far in all this scene of the heavenly
Paradise remains above and beyond any direct vision of Him on the
part of Dante or the reader.  Direct vision of Him will only be
given at the end; here we still see by reflected light.

	|13.  Le facce tutte avean di fiamma viva~: Cf. Ezech. 1:13:
"Aspectus eorum quasi carbonum ignis ardentium."  ("Their
appearance was like that of burning coals of fire.")

	|14-15.  e l'ali d'oro~: Ruby red and gold were colors in
the first "prefatory" vision (cf. ^Par.~ XXX, 66).  |e l'altro
tanto bianco~... |arriva~: Cf. Dan. 7:9: "Vestimentum eius
candidum quasi nix."  ("His garment was white as snow.")  See
also Matt. 28:3; Apoc. 10:1.  This is the robe which angels
wear, apparently, corresponding to the white "stole" (^Par.~
XXX, 129) of human souls.  The reader will recall a scene in
Purgatory where angels descended wearing robes of a tender green
color (^Purg.~ VIII, 28-30), but there that color was a symbol
of hope, whereas the angel that piloted the boat bringing souls
to Purgatory had a white robe, but also white wings (^Purg.~ II,
22-26).  The angels who stand at the exits of the terraces in
that second realm are robed in white (see, for example, ^Purg.~
XII, 89).

	|16.  Quando scendean~... ^fianco~ {v.18}: It now appears
that this simile of bees bearing nectar is actually the reverse
of the normal activity of bees in nature, which is to bear from
the flower to the hive.  Here the "bees" bear their "nectar" from
the hive (God) to the flower.  For other inverted similes, see
^Par.~ XXVII, 71 and 118-119, and see nn. to ^Par.~ XXVII,
67-72 and 118-119.  |di banco in banco~: "From tier to tier." 
Cf. ^soglie~, ^Par.~ XXX, 113.

	|17.  porgevan de la pace e de l'ardore~: Peace and ardor
(love) are the "honey" which the angels bear to the petals of the
great flower.  This is in addition to the "honey" (to keep the
metaphor) which each human soul receives by gazing directly upon
God, through the light of glory.  In connection with such a
multiplication of love in Heaven the reader may recall a lesson
on this subject in ^Purg.~ XV, 55-57.

	|18.  ventilando il fianco~: "By fanning their sides,"
i.e., by the action of their wings as they fly upward.  One
should also visualize the fluttering robes of the angels as well,
even as in ^Purg.~ VIII, 29-30.

	|19-21.  N$e l'interporsi~... |splendore~: These verses
are clearly concerned to remove a doubt in the reader's mind:
Would not the host of angels in their fluttering robes obstruct
the vision of God which the human souls enjoy in their eternal
beatitude?  The |splendore~ is the descending light of glory
which makes such vision possible.  |'l disopra~: God, who is
gazed upon in direct vision, face to face, by the souls, but not
yet by Dante the pilgrim.

	|22-24.  ch$e la luce~... |ostante~: The opening verses of
the ^Paradiso~ are an excellent gloss to these verses, as are
those of ^Par.~ II, 112-148.  |essere ostante~: "Be an
obstacle."  See ^Conv.~ III, vii, 5, where Dante tells us that
angels are diaphanous.

	|26.  frequente~: "Abounding."  |Frequente~ is a
Latinism, from ^frequens.~  |in gente antica e in novella~:
Members of the old (Hebrew) and the new (Christian) church.  We
are to see the distinction strikingly observed in the seating
arrangement in the amphitheater.

	|27-28.  viso e amore~: The two terms correspond
respectively to the activity of the intellect and that of the
will.  |tutto~: The adjective is here used adverbially:
"entirely."  |ad un segno~: God, who is the goal of all.  By now,
it will be noted, the Deity is definitely located as a point
above (still not seen by reader or wayfarer), as is further
brought out by the words |unica stella~ in the following verse. 
It will be remembered that there was a time, in the total picture
of all existence, when God was a circumference, not a center or a
point.  See n. to ^Par.~ XXVIII, 41-42.  |Oh trina luce che `n
unica stella~: The verse clearly indicates God in His tri-unity.

	|29.  scintillando a lor vista, s@i li appaga~: By giving
of His light, the light of glory (see ^Par.~ XXX, 100), which
makes it possible for the creature to gaze upon Him, God gives
that creature the only peace that can ever completely satisfy
(^appagare~).  |appaga~: It seems best to understand this as the
third-person form of the verb.  See E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 398.

	|30.  guarda qua giuso a la nostra procella~: The "storm"
referred to is that which is agitating all mankind in life on
earth -- and the reader knows well from the poem by now how great
it is, in the poet's view.  The exhortation, turned earthwards in
its focus, anticipates that of vss. 37-39.

	|31-34.  Se i barbari~... ^sopra~ {v.36}: Perhaps the
"barbarians" who served in the Roman army, or came for whatever
reason to the city before it was destroyed by them, are meant,
for then the Lateran and many another building in Rome (|l'ardua
sua opra~) were truly splendid and amazing to behold.  |tal
plaga~... |figlio~: "The `zone' that is always `covered by
Helice' is the North.  The nymph Helice or Callisto was
transformed into the constellation of the Great Bear, and her son
Arcas or Bo,otes into the Little Bear: ^Met.~ II, 496-530,
especially 515-517; cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 131.  The Bears, or
Dippers, are close to the North Star" (Gr).  |ond'ella @e vaga~:
"Whom she loves" (Gr).  |l'ardua sua opra~: "Her lofty
buildings."

	|35.  stupefaciensi~ = ^si stupefacevano.~  |Laterano~:
Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 86.  The Lateran was the old papal palace in
Rome, first the residence of emperors, then of popes down into
Dante's time.  According to tradition it was given to Pope
Sylvester by the Emperor Constantine and thus became the seat of
Christian dominion.  The present palace, dating from ca. 1586,
was built on the ruins of the original structure, which was
destroyed by fire in 1308 and was said to have belonged
originally to the Laterani family.

	|36.  a le cose mortali and@o di sopra~: "Surpassed all
other mortal things," i.e., man-made edifices.

	|37.  ,io, che al divino da l'umano~: On this verse and
others in the present canto, Grandgent observes: "The verses of
the present canto offer an unusual abundance of examples of
hiatus and diaeresis, which would seem to indicate a slow,
thoughtful, impressive delivery.  In such cases as ^cominci@o~ /
^elli~ and ^far@a~ / ^ogni~ (where a final vowel is stressed)
hiatus is the rule in our poet.  Also, in words like ^ard,ua~,
^f,iata~, ^gaud,ioso~ (contrasted with ^gaudio~), ^glor,ise~,
^or,iental~, ^reg,ion~, ^r,iaccesa~, ^s,uadi~ -- mostly Latinisms
-- diaeresis is rather to be expected in the ^Commedia~; although
the number of such forms is uncommonly large in this canto.  Very
rare indeed, on the other hand, are lines comparable to 37, 47,
and 53:

     ,i/o, che/ al divino da l'umano
     menava / ,i/o li occhi per li gradi,
     gi@a tutta m,i/o sguardo avea compresa."

On vs. 39 Grandgent also notes: "This phrase, the climax of the
tiercet, is Dante's last and bitterest fling at Florence."

	|40.  compiuto~: "Filled."

	|41.  tra esso e 'l gaudio~: "It [my amazement] and my
joy together" (dual subject of the verb |facea~).

	|42.  libito~: "Pleasing."  Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 56.  |non
udire~: This refers to Beatrice's silence.

	|43-45.  E quasi~... |stea~: It will be recalled that the
journey was termed a pilgrimage (that is, the wayfarers were
termed pilgrims) only after Dante's arrival in Purgatory (see
^Purg.~ II, 63), where positive ascent began.  The reader will
remark how frequently, now at the end of the long upward way, the
pilgrim simile and metaphor come into the poem, and often, as
here, in a notably strategic way, for the very notion of
pilgrimage raises the question of "whereto" and of "return home." 
(See, for example, the opening verses of ^Purg.~ VIII.)  A
pilgrim may finally, in his outward journey away from home, reach
"the temple of his vow," as here implied, and then make his way
back home, where he hopes to tell of all the wonderful things he
saw.  This, applied to Dante the wayfarer at this high terminal
point, projects, by clear implication, his "return home" -- and
his poem is the telling of it all to those "back home."  In
short, the poem here, at the end, is using the pilgrim image so
as to point to a return to earth which must necessarily be that
of the living man who then writes the poem.  |si ricrea~:
"Refreshes himself," "restores himself" after the hardships of
the way.  |tempio del suo voto~: The shrine which he has vowed to
visit.  |ridir~: To tell the people at home.  |ello~: The
^tempio.~  |stea~ = ^stia.~

	|46-48.  su per la viva luce~... |recirculando~: The
pilgrim scans the whole amphitheater from where he stands,
"walking" with his eyes over the whole, an "eye tour," as it
were.  The |viva luce~, it should be remembered, is still
^reflected~ light (^Par.~ XXX, 106-108).

	|49.  Vedea~ = ^vedevo.~  |s,uadi~: From the Latin
^suadus~, meaning "conducive to" or "persuasive" in its commonest
usage.  In the present context, however, it seems best to take
the meaning to be passive rather than active, thus "persuaded" to
charity, i.e., "centered on" love, "all given to" love.

	|50.  d'altrui lume~: God's light.  |fregiati e di suo
riso~: "Radiant with their own smiles."  This is |riso~ expressed
as a radiance.  Cf. ^Par.~ IX, 70-71.

	|51.  atti~: "Demeanor."  |onestadi~: "Decorum."

	|52-59.  La forma general~... |Beatrice~: It will be
noted that the verbs in these verses are all in the past
descriptive, thus building up to the dramatic shift to the
narrative past absolute at the surprise moment, |vidi~ (vs. 59). 
And it is a moment when the reader is bound to recall another,
when Dante had taken in, as it were, the whole procession at the
top of Purgatory, including finally Beatrice at her appearance on
the chariot, and turned, as he thought, to confide in Virgil,
only to find that Virgil was no longer with him (^Purg.~ XXX,
40-54).  |Uno intendea, e altro mi rispuose~: "I expected one
thing, but another presented itself to me."  |rispuose~: I.e.,
^corrispose.~  |sene~: "Elder," from the Latin ^senex.~  The
Latinism confers greater dignity on the figure and suggests much
reverence toward him on the part of the poet.  The term is
repeated in vs. 94, modified with ^santo.~  This proves to be
Bernard of Clairvaux, but identification is withheld until vs.
102, and full attention now centers on Beatrice and the "goodbye"
to her.  For particulars regarding Bernard, see n. to vs. 102.

	|60.  vestito con~: "Clad like," i.e., dressed in the
white "stole," as are all the other blessed (^Par.~ XXX, 129). 
|gloriose~: The adjective conveys the notion of ^gloria~ in its
full theological sense: those who now enjoy eternal beatitude,
with a vision of God made possible through the light of glory. 
For an earlier use of the word in this sense, see ^Vita nuova~,
II, 1, where Dante refers to Beatrice (dead and already in
Paradise) as ^la gloriosa donna de la mia mente~ ("the glorious
lady of my mind").

	|61.  gene~: "Cheeks," from the Latin ^genae.~  Again a
Latinism contributes to the dignity and reverence of the figure.

	|62.  pio~: Given the context, the primary meaning of the
word is "loving."

	|64.  Ov'@e ella~?  With this the poet has impressively
dramatized the immediate and most anxious concern of the pilgrim
for his Beatrice, no longer by his side, an over-riding anxiety
which admits of no curiosity in regard to the identity of the
"elder" who has replaced her.

	|65.  A terminar lo tuo disiro~: The desire is, of
course, the innate desire of natural love, common to every human
creature, to attain to God and to the vision of Him face to face. 
Cf. ^Purg.~ XVII, 127-129.  The fact that this ^sene~ {v.59},
who proves to be St. Bernard, has been sent by Beatrice to bring
about this ^terminus~ of all "unquiet hearts" says much about
Beatrice's limits as guide in the journey.  On this point, see C.
S. Singleton (1958), pp. 23-31, and on Bernard's specific role as
Beatrice's replacement, see pp. 20-23.

	|66.  mosse~: Cf. ^Par.~ XXVI, 118.

	|67-68.  e se riguardi~... |rivedrai~: "Beatrice's own
seat is `in the third row from the top tier.'  The 1st row is
that of Mary, the 2nd that of Eve, the 3rd that of Rachel, beside
whom Beatrice sits: see ^Inf.~ II, 102; ^Par.~ XXXII, 8-9. 
Contemplation and Revelation sit side by side.  The number 3 (as
well as the number 9) has always been mysteriously associated
with Beatrice: see ^V.N.~ XXIX" (Gr).  See Fig. 5, p. 534 {a
"map" of the celestial rose}.

	|69.  che suoi merti le sortiro~: Despite the symbolism
of the number three (see preceding note), this phrase concerning
Beatrice's merits focuses on her primarily as the particular
human individual and soul that she was, for she now, like all the
other particular souls in the great amphitheater, has her seat
according to the original endowment of grace given to her by God
when He "breathed" her immortal soul into existence.  See
^Purg.~ XXV, 67-75; ^Par.~ XXXII, 61-66.  Such a focus upon
Beatrice leads to the striking change of address to her, a change
from ^voi~ to ^tu~ (see n. to vs. 80).  |sortiro~ = ^sortirono.~ 
For this use of ^sortire~, see ^Par.~ XVIII, 105.

	|72.  reflettendo da s$e li etterni rai~: Beatrice, who
had guided by reflected light, is now seen (as is the whole rose)
by that same kind of light.  The wayfarer does not attempt, as
yet, to see God directly, by the light of glory, this experience
being reserved for the last canto and the very end.

	|73-75.  Da quella region~... ^vista~ {v.76}: An "eye" at
the very bottom of the sea "is not so far away" from the top of
the earth's atmosphere -- the "region that thunders highest up"
(cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 43-57; XXXII, 111).  |qualunque~: I.e.,
^qualunque occhio mortale.~

	|76.  vista~: Eyes, or post of observation.

	|77.  effige~: "Image."

	|78.  per mezzo mista~: I.e., "blurred by anything
between."  Here in this spiritual heaven, there is no air or
atmosphere to impede vision.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXX, 122-123.

	|79.  O donna~... ^potestate~ {v.87}: The verses which
now follow, in this final address to Beatrice, constitute not
only a prayer, but a kind of paean in an original sense of the
word: a hymn of praise, which serves, from this terminal point,
to look back over the whole journey, from the first two cantos of
the ^Inferno.~  The reader will note that the poem begins to come
full circle, so to speak, at several such points here near the
end.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXXII, 133-138.  |vige~: "Is strong."

	|80.  soffristi~: Dante has addressed Beatrice, without
exception up to now, with the respectful second person plural
(^voi~); but now with this verb in the second person singular
(and then the confirming adjectives and subject pronoun ^tu~), it
is clear that in these final words to her he shifts to the more
familiar second person singular.  The reader who may be following
the translation, which does not use ^thou~ or ^thee~, will do
well to take note of this shift, which should strike every reader
with surprise and leave him wondering as to the reason for it. 
Would Dante the pilgrim become less respectful to Beatrice at
such a point and in such a context?  This is hardly conceivable. 
The shift clearly signals something else, namely the fact that
Beatrice is no longer ^the guide~ (with a burden of allegorical
meaning) but that, as she has taken her seat among the blessed,
she is now seen as the individual historical personage, or the
immortal individual soul, as she sits in eternal beatitude.

	It will be noted, in the next canto, that Dante addresses
St. Bernard with the familiar form and for the same reason
(^Par.~ XXII, 100-102) even when he begins to speak with the
words ^O santo padre.~  This is in sharp contrast with, for
example, Dante's shift from ^tu~ to ^voi~ in Purgatory (^Purg.~
XIX, 95 and 131) when he realizes that he is speaking to the soul
of Pope Adrian V.  Surely Dante would not show ^less~ respect to
St. Bernard!  But he addresses him immediately with the familiar
form.  Thus, insofar as Bernard can be viewed as the third guide
in the journey, the reader may see, as he remembers the forms of
address to the three guides as such, the pattern of ^tu~ with
Virgil, ^voi~ with Beatrice (as long as she guides), and ^tu~
with Bernard.

	It should be noted that Bernard cannot be a "light" in
the sense that Virgil and Beatrice are such, as guides, for the
third light is the light of glory, which is God's very own light. 
See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 20-23.

	|81.  in inferno lasciar le tue vestige~: That is, in
Limbo (^Inf.~ II, 52-108).  With this turn of phrase the reader
gets a glimpse of the analogy Beatrice-Christ, for it was to
Limbo only that Christ descended in the harrowing of Hell
(^Inf.~ IV, 52-63).  For a strong reinforcement of this analogy,
see ^Purg.~ XXIX-XXXI and the pertinent notes, on the advent of
Beatrice in the procession at the top of Mt. Purgatory.  See
especially ^Purg.~ XXX, 139-141.  |vestige~: Cf. the form
^vestigge~ in ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 108.

	|82.  di tante cose quant'i' ho vedute~: The whole phrase
depends on ^grazia~ and ^virtute~ in vs. 84.

	|83-84.  dal tuo podere~... |virtute~: "I owe the grace
and efficacy... to thy power and goodness" (Gr).  For the meaning
of |virt@u~ here in the sense of "power," and of a power which
Beatrice specifically has, see Virgil's words of recognition of
her in Limbo, ^Inf.~ II, 76-78.  Also see C. S. Singleton
(1956).  |riconosco~: Cf. ^Par.~ XXII, 113; XXIX, 59.

	|85.  Tu~: The expressed subject pronoun is emphatic. 
|m'hai di servo tratto a libertate~: Cf. Rom. 6:22.  In ^Summa
theol.~ II-II, q. 183, a. 4, resp., Thomas Aquinas writes:

     Invenitur autem in rebus spiritualibus duplex servitus et
     duplex libertas: una quidem est servitus peccati; altera
     vero est servitus iustitiae.  Similiter etiam est duplex
     libertas; una quidem a peccato; alia vero a iustitia, ut
     patet per Apostolum; qui dicit ad Rom. 6, 20: ^Cum servi~
     ^essetis peccati, liberi fuistis iustitiae; nunc vero~
     ^liberati a peccato, servi estis facti Deo.~

     Est autem servitus peccati vel iustitiae, cum aliquis vel ex
     habitu peccati ad malum inclinatur, vel ex habitu iustitiae
     inclinatur ad bonum; similiter etiam libertas a peccato est,
     dum aliquis ab inclinatione peccati non superatur: libertas
     autem a iustitia est, cum aliquis propter amorem iustitiae
     non retardatur a malo.  Verumtamen quia homo secundum
     naturalem rationem ad iustitiam inclinatur, peccatum autem
     est contra naturalem rationem, consequens est quod libertas
     a peccato sit vera libertas quae coniungitur servituti
     iustitiae; quia per utrumque tendit homo in id quod est
     conveniens sibi: et similiter vera servitus est servitus
     peccati; cui coniungitur libertas a iustitia, quia scilicet
     per hoc homo impeditur ab eo quod est proprium sibi.

     Hoc autem quod homo efficiatur servus iustitiae vel peccati,
     contingit per humanum studium, sicut Apostolus dicit ibidem:
     ^Cui exhibetis vos servos ad obediendum, servi eius estis~,
     ^cui obedistis, sive peccati ad mortem, sive obeditionis ad~
     ^iustitiam.~

     Now in spiritual things there is a twofold servitude and a
     twofold freedom: for there is the servitude of sin and the
     servitude of justice; and there is likewise a twofold
     freedom, from sin, and from justice, as appears from the
     words of the Apostle (Rom. vi. 20, 22), ^When you were the~
     ^servants of sin, you were free men to justice;... but now~
     ^being made free from sin~, you are... ^become servants to~
     ^God.~

     Now the servitude of sin or justice consists in being
     inclined to evil by a habit of sin, or inclined to good by a
     habit of justice: and in like manner freedom from sin is not
     to be overcome by the inclination to sin, and freedom from
     justice is not to be held back from evil for the love of
     justice.  Nevertheless, since man, by his natural reason, is
     inclined to justice, while sin is contrary to natural
     reason, it follows that freedom from sin is true freedom
     which is united to the servitude of justice, since they both
     incline man to that which is becoming to him.  In like
     manner true servitude is the servitude of sin, which is
     connected with freedom from justice, because man is thereby
     hindered from attaining that which is proper to him.  That a
     man become the servant of justice or sin results from his
     efforts, as the Apostle declares (^ibid.~, verse 16): ^To~
     ^whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants~
     ^you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or~
     ^of obedience unto justice.~

In this light the whole ^Divine Comedy~ might be said to have as
its central theme the attainment of liberty, which is complete
subjection to God's will.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XVI, 80, and the
corresponding note.

	|87.  che~ = ^per cui.~  |avei~ = ^avevi.~

	|88.  magnificenza~: "Magnificence~ in mediaeval writings
is often to be interpreted by the use of ^magnificentia~ in the
Latin Aristotle.  It is the translation of
%mu%epsilon%gamma%alpha%lambda%o%pi%rho%$epsilon%pi%epsilon%iota%alpha
which means ^munificence~, i.e. liberality or generosity, but on
a grand scale" (TC).  Cf. Ps. 70 [71]:21: "Multiplicasti
magnificentiam tuam."  ("Renew your benefits toward me.") 
|custodi~: "Preserve intact."

	|89-90.  s@i che~... |disnodi~: Dante's last words to
Beatrice touch on the state of his soul at death, the overriding
consideration in the matter of salvation, as all readers know by
now.  Virgil, in his dismissal of Dante, declared his will to be
^santo~ (^Purg.~ XXVII, 140).  Now the "prayer" concerns the
entire soul, and the same adjective is used.  The reader is
surely expected to think that Dante's prayer is to be answered. 
Beatrice's smile down at him would seem to be the full assurance
that it will be so.

	|91.  Cos@i orai~: Thus the paean is explicitly termed a
prayer, as it clearly is.  |s@i lontana~: Cf. vss. 73-76.

	|92.  parea~ = ^appariva.~  |sorrise e riguardommi~:
Beatrice's smile, as she looks down reassuringly to the man whom
she has brought to spiritual freedom, provides an unforgettable
last glimpse of her, the bearer of beatitude who first appeared
to the poet when he was but nine years old (as recounted in the
^Vita nuova~).

	|93.  poi si torn@o a l'etterna fontana~: No reader can
fail to feel the import of Beatrice's last gesture, which serves
to pass on to God above the full praise which belongs to Him and
not to her or any other creature.  In fact, Dante's paean to her
was under some sense of tension for the Christian reader in this
regard, for his praise seemed to end with her and not to refer
beyond her and above, to the true and only Power (and eternal
source of power) capable of leading Dante to this high
destination.

	|94.  assommi~: "Complete."

	|96.  a che priego e amor santo mandommi~: Bernard now
resumes his role as guide, sent by Beatrice.  (Cf. vss. 65-66.) 
The perfect completion is, of course, the vision of God face to
face at the end.  But that time has not yet come, and Bernard's
words, as they continue, speak in terms of a further preparation
of the pilgrim for that culminating experience, a "preparation"
which has already begun (see ^Par.~ XXX, 52-54).  See vss. 98-99.

	|99.  montar per lo raggio divino~: These words
anticipate the terminal event in ^Par.~ XXXIII.  But the reader
will note that the pilgrim has not yet entered into any such
event and that he continues to see by reflected light of the
divine radiance, or the light of glory, as he enters upon the
"eye tour" of the rose, which now begins with Mary, who is a rose
herself (see n. to vs. 1).

	|100-101.  E la regina del cielo~... ^Bernardo~ {v.102}:
"Bernard's devotion to the Virgin Mary is expressed in his four
homilies, ^`De laudibus Virginis matris'~, and his nine sermons
for the feasts of her ^Purification~, ^Assumption~, ^Nativity~,
etc., as well as incidentally in other works.  It is noteworthy
that he opposed the celebration of her Immaculate Conception.  His
contemporary, Peter Cellensis, says of him: `He was the most
intimate fosterling of Our Lady, to whom he dedicated not only
one monastery, but the monasteries of the whole Cistercian
order'" (TC).  |ne far@a~ = ^ci far@a.~

	|102.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |Bernardo~: Only now is the
replacement for Beatrice named.  There has been some suspense in
this regard, which now is resolved.  St. Bernard, the great abbot
of Clairvaux and preacher of the disastrous second Crusade, was
born of noble parents in the village of Fontaines, near Dijon in
Burgundy, in 1091.  After studying in Paris, in 1113, at the age
of twenty-two, he joined the newly founded Benedictine monastery
of Citeaux, at the head of which was Stephen Harding, an
Englishman.  Two years later, in 1115, Bernard was selected by
Harding to be the head of one of the branches that the increasing
fame of Citeaux made it necessary to establish.  He set out with
a small band of devoted followers, journeying north until he came
to a spot in the diocese of Langres in Champagne, where he made a
clearing and founded his famous abbey of Clairvaux.

	Bernard's influence soon spread beyond the limits of his
monastery, and from this time until his death he was one of the
most prominent figures in the history of his time.  After the
death of Honorius II in 1130 his championship secured the triumph
of Innocent II over his rival Anacletus; and in 1140 at the
Council of Sens he secured the condemnation of Peter Abelard. 
The news of the capture of Edessa by the infidels in 1144 led
Bernard, with the approval of the pope, to preach a new Crusade,
which resulted in the disastrous expedition of Louis VII and
Conrad III (1147-1149).  The failure of the Crusade was a
crushing blow to Bernard, from which he never recovered, and
though he continued to take an active part in public affairs, he
gradually failed and died on August 20, 1153.  He was canonized
by Pope Alexander III in 1173.

	Bernard's numerous writings consist of epistles, sermons,
and theological treatises, which are conspicuous for his devotion
to the Virgin Mary, whence on his canonization he was described
as "alumnus familiarissimus Dominae Nostrae."  One of his most
important works is the ^De consideratione~ (referred to by Dante
in ^Epist.~ XIII, 80), written in the last year of his life and
addressed to his disciple, Pope Eugenius III.  It is precisely a
work on contemplation which is the allegorical basis for the
whole upward ascent to the culminating experience that Dante the
wayfarer is now to have, with Bernard praying for it and then
standing by.

	|103.  Qual @e colui che forse di Croazia~: Readers of
Petrarch might well remember here his famous sonnet (^Rime~, XVI)
beginning: "Movesi il vecchierel canuto e bianco."  ("The old
man, white and pallid, sets out.")  Thus here yet another simile
of pilgrimage, with continuing stress on this fact (see n. to
vss. 43-45).  |forse~: This touch allows that the pilgrim might
come from any distant land, but "let it be Croatia."


	|104.  Veronica~: The Veronica is the true image (^vera
icona~) of the Saviour, left on a kerchief which a holy woman had
handed him, on his way to Calvary, to wipe the sweat from his
face.  It was shown at St. Peter's in Rome on certain days. 
Hosts of pilgrims went from afar to see it, as Dante tells us in
^Vita nuova~, XL, 1-7.

	|105.  che per l'antica fame non sen sazia~: "`Who,
having craved it for so long, cannot look enough.'  -- Some would
read ^fama~ for |fame~" (Gr).  See M. Barbi (1934), pp. 253-254.

	|106.  fin che si mostra~: "As long as it is exhibited."

	|108.  or fu s@i fatta la sembianza vostra~?  "Was your
semblance really so!"  |Or~ is an exclamatory "now" with the
overtone of "really."  It should be noted that the second person
plural is used in this case, whereas the Deity is addressed with
the second person singular (cf. the Lord's Prayer of ^Purg.~ XI,
1-24).

	|109-111.  la vivace carit@a~: Love is stressed, with
Bernard, who has already spoken in terms of love and lover (vss.
100-101).  |che `n questo mondo~... |pace~: Bernard's two
principal qualifications to serve as final guide in the journey
stem from his special devotion to the Virgin Mary and from his
fame as one dedicated to mystical contemplation with special
emphasis on the affective movement of the mind as it rises to
God, an emphasis which later Franciscan thought and devotion
adopted and stressed.  It was believed that Bernard, in such
meditation, had a foretaste of the peace of Heaven.  In the
^Meditationes piissimae~ (XIV, 36-37), ascribed to Bernard, there
is a rhapsody on the joys of contemplation.  See also Bernard,
^Sermones in Cantica Canticorum~, XXIII, 15-16.  As noted above,
Dante in his ^Letter to Can Grande~ (^Epist.~ XIII, 80) refers
the reader of his ^Paradiso~ to Bernard's work ^De
contemplatione.~  |contemplando, gust@o di quella pace~: |Gust@o~
and |pace~ stress precisely the affective aspect of the
experience, the peace attained by the will, rather than the
vision attained by the intellect.  See preceding note.

	|112.  quest'esser giocondo~: This happy existence, the
condition of the blessed, which, for the human creature, is of
course the happiest that can be conceived.  Bernard's words thus
initiate the invitation to begin the "eye tour" of the great
amphitheater where the blessed sit, a tour that will occupy most
of the next canto and is a preparation of the wayfarer for the
supreme experience described in the final canto, as is stated in
vss. 97-99.

	|114.  tenendo li occhi pur qua gi@u al fondo~: Dante has
already looked up almost to the rim of the amphitheater, to see
Beatrice.  Bernard now refers to the fact that Dante is looking
at him and not upwards.


	|115-117.  ma guarda~... |devoto~: Bernard's first
exhortation to the wayfarer, as the "eye tour" begins, is that he
should look first at Mary, truly the queen of heaven as he states
it.  Any other beginning for the tour would have been most
unseemly on the part of Bernard, Mary's great lover.  But
Bernard's exhortation also follows a hierarchical principle
requiring that one begin at the summit, which a medieval poet
would hardly fail to observe in any case.  And the reader may
pause to consider that with this focus on the Virgin Mary, here
so near the end, the action of the poem is, in a sense, coming
full circle, for it was due to Mary's direct intervention in
Heaven that the wayfarer was rescued from the dark slope at the
beginning through that relay of grace that ended with Virgil's
coming to the man who was being pushed back into the darkness
(^Inf.~ I-II).  Of course, ineffably higher than Mary but not
directly seen as yet is the triune God whose ^duro giudicio~ was
swayed by Mary (^Inf.~ II, 96) and with whom the descent of
grace originates.  Mary was serving her familiar role as our
advocate in heaven.  The reader is soon to see that the focus
returns to Mary with the prayer that opens the last canto of the
poem, a prayer for another descent of grace here at the end, a
prayer that the wayfarer may truly complete his journey.  For the
seating arrangement of Mary and many others to be named in the
next canto, see Fig. 5, p. 534.  |veggi~ = ^veda~ or ^vegga.~

	|118.  Io levai li occhi~... ^scemo~ {v.126}: Two similes
now make it clear that Mary's seat is on the highest rim of the
amphitheater and in the best place on that rim, that being the
eastern point (as if there were ^directions~ here in this
spiritual heaven!).  But the reader knows that the emphatic
suggestion (through simile) that her place is indeed in the east
puts Mary's throne at the point where, on earth, we see the sun
rise, and on the horizon of that east whither we turn to pray and
according to which all medieval cathedrals were oriented.  Cf.
^Purg.~ IV, 53-54; XXIX, 12; and the notes to these verses.  On
medieval world maps east, rather than north, is "up."  It will be
remembered that Beatrice appeared finally in her procession at
the top of Purgatory in the figure of a rising sun (^Purg.~ XXX,
22-27).

	|120.  soverchia~: "Surpasses" in brightness.

	|121-122.  quasi di valle~... |occhi~: The phrase |di
valle~... |a monte~, obvious in its meaning, is an established
one, yet to use it here, thus bringing in |monte~ in the context
of looking up to Mary there, would seem clearly to call to mind
Ps. 120 [121]:1: "Levavi oculos meos in montes, unde veniet
auxilium mihi."  ("I lift up my eyes toward the mountains, whence
help shall come to me.")  And this too suggests the completion of
a circle in the action of the poem, for this is what the pilgrim
Dante did at the very outset of the journey (^Inf.~ I, 16-18). 
|parte ne lo stremo~: "A part of the highest edge" or "rim."

	|123.  l'altra fronte~: "The rest of the rim."

	|124-125.  E come quivi~... |s'infiamma~: The adverb
|quivi~ functions here, with its modifying phrase, as a noun,
subject of |s'infiamma~: "And as on earth the point of the
horizon where the chariot pole of the sun is expected." 
|Fetonte~: For Pha@ethon and his unhappy attempt to drive the
chariot of the Sun, see ^Inf.~ XVII, 106-108; ^Purg.~ XXIX,
118-120; ^Par.~ XVII, 3.

	|126.  e quinci e quindi~: "On either side."

	|127.  quella pacifica oriafiamma~: "The Oriflamme
(^aurea fiamma~) was the standard given by the Angel Gabriel to
the ancient kings of France, representing a flame on a golden
ground.  No one who fought under it could be conquered" (TC). 
|oriafiamma~ = ^orifiamma~ (French ^orifiamme~).

	|128.  nel mezzo~: There where Mary will be seen with the
thousand and more angels paying homage to her.  Thus, through the
total figure, Mary is seen to be throughout eternity as a rising
sun on the horizon of this amphitheater.

	|130.  con le penne sparte~: This is clearly a posture of
devotion and of angelic obeisance to the mother of the Son of
Man.  And it will be remembered that Mary is a human creature,
and that man was created lesser than the angels.  See ^Par.~ IX,
137-138.

	|132-133.  ciascun distinto di fulgore e d'arte~:
According to established angelology, each angel constitutes in
itself a distinct species.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 136-138 and n. to
^Par.~ XXIX, 137.  |arte~: "Ministry," in this instance the
|giochi~ and |canti~ of the following verse.  For |arte~ in this
sense, as applied to the angels, cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 52.

	|135.  li altri santi~: The rest of the blessed (human
souls).  The phrase focuses on Mary as a human creature, like the
rest.  It should be remembered that she, like her Son, is here in
her glorified body already and is the only purely human soul to
have that radiant body before the Last Judgment (cf. ^Par.~ XV,
127-128).

	|136.  divizia~: "Wealth."  This is the modern Italian
^dovizia.~

	|137.  imaginar~: It should be remembered that the
faculty known as the ^imaginativa~ is primarily an
image-receiving faculty (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 13, and n. to
^Purg.~ XVII, 13-18), and the verb in its meaning corresponds to
that of the noun.  However, in this context, since this is the
voice of the poet speaking, it has the added meaning of "recovery
in memory" of that which had been experienced in the receptive
^imaginativa.~  In this sense the verb takes on a less passive
meaning.

	|140-141.  nel caldo suo caler~: Warmth or heat expresses
love, |affetto~, and |caldo~ with |caler~ stresses this, with
|affetto~ following in the next verse.  Bernard is the great
lover of Mary, as noted above.  Petrocchi has preferred the
variant |caler~ to "calor," which other editors have, for
persuasive reasons, terming it a Latinism, the verb ^calere~ in
Latin meaning either "to grow warm" or "to feel warm."  Here it
is the infinitive used as a noun, in the objective focus, much as
^disio~ can refer to the object of desire (cf. ^Purg.~ XXXI, 54,
and see "disiri," ^Purg.~ XXXI, 22).  In objective reference,
accordingly, |caler~ is Mary, the object of Bernard's "calore." 
See the use of ^piacere~ which immediately follows in the opening
of the next canto (^Par.~ XXXII, 1).

	|142.  rimirar~: Dante had turned to Bernard and now
turns again to gaze on Mary.
