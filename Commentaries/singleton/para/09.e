	|1.  Clemenza~: The Clemence whom the poet apostrophizes
here may be either the wife or the daughter of Charles Martel of
Hungary, and there is considerable doubt among commentators as to
which Clemence the poet is addressing.  Charles' wife, Clemence
of Habsburg, daughter of the Emperor Rudolf I, died in 1295, in
the same epidemic that claimed her royal husband's life when he
was only twenty-four years of age.  Therefore, in the fictional
time of the poem, Charles and Clemence had both died five years
before.  Would the poet address in this fashion a Clemence,
spouse of Charles, who was already dead? Some commentators have
held this to be unlikely, and have therefore argued that Charles'
daughter is intended, Clemence of Anjou, who was born of Charles
and Clemence of Habsburg at Naples in 1293, and who was married
to King Louis X of France in 1315, and lived until 1328.  Thus,
in addressing the daughter, the poet would be addressing a living
Clemence.

	The arguments for and against the one identification and
the other are many.  Any reader interested in exploring them will
find them expounded in the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~ under the
entries "Clemenza d'Asburgo" and "Clemenza d'Angi@o."  All things
considered, and despite some serious objections to be reckoned
with, Clemence of Habsburg, spouse of Charles, would seem the
more likely candidate.  A strong argument in favor of this choice
is the address "|tuo~," which is more properly said to a ^wife~
than to a ^daughter~, and "^vostri~" (vs. 6) likewise seems to
point to husband and wife, rather than to father and daughter. 
However, no conclusive proof is available.

	|3.  la sua semenza~: His son, Charles Robert (Carobert),
who was king of Hungary from 1308 to 1342.  Born in 1288, he was
the son of Charles Martel and Clemence of Habsburg.  Un the death
of Otto of Bavaria (in 1308) he succeeded to the throne of
Hungary, of which his father had been titular king (1292-1295),
and on the death (in 1309) of his grandfather, Charles II, he
claimed the throne of Naples also; his claim, however, was
disputed by his uncle Robert (eldest surviving son of Charles
II), who appealed in person to Pope Clement V and, obtaining a
decision in his favor, was crowned king of Naples at Avignon,
June 1309 (Villani, VIII, 112), his nephew being at the same time
recognized by Clement as king of Hungary.  Dante is referring, in
vss. 2-3, to the fact that Charles Robert was deprived of his
right of succession to the throne of Naples.

	|4.  muover~: Other editors have "volger" instead.  See
Petrocchi's justification of |muover~ in his vol. I, ^Introduzione~,
pp. 231-232.

	|5-6.  pianto giusto~: "A just punishment," literally
"just lamentation."  |ai vostri danni~: Readers of the translation
should note the plural |vostri~ here.

	|7.  la vita~: The soul.  Cf. ^Par.~ XII, 127.

	|8.  al Sol~: To God.

	|9.  tanto~: "Sufficient."

	|10.  fatture~: "Creatures," "men."  Cf. ^Purg.~ XVII,
102.

	|11.  s@i fatto ben~: God, as referred to in the verses
immediately preceding.

	|12.  le vostre tempie~: "Your faces " "your eyes"
(literally, "brows").

	|14-15.  'l suo voler piacermi~: The object of
|significava~ in the following verse.

	|18.  fermi~ = ^mi fecero.~

	|19-21.  Deh, metti al mio voler~... |penso~: Dante begs
the unknown soul to answer without waiting to be questioned.

	|22.  nova~: Unknown.

	|23.  cantava~: Cf. ^Par.~ VIII, 28-30.

	|24.  seguette~ = ^segu@i.~  |a cui~ = ^colui al quale.~

	|25-27.  la terra prava italica~: All Italy is judged by
these words.  |che siede tra Rialto~... |Piava~: The March of
Treviso, in the northeast corner of Italy, lies between Venice
(indicated here by the Rialto, the largest of the islands on
which the city is built) and the Alps, where the rivers Brenta
and Piave have their source.  |Brenta~: See n. to ^Inf.~ XV, 7. 
|Piava~: The Piave, a river of northern Italy, which rises in the
Carnic Alps and flowing south and southeast through Venetia falls
into the Gulf of Venice some twenty miles from Venice.

	|28.  colle~: The hill of Romano whereon the castle of
the Ezzelino family stood.

	|29-30.  una facella~... |assalto~: The "torch" or
scourge of mankind is Ezzelino (or Azzolino) III da Romano, the
most infamous and bloodthirsty of the petty tyrants of medieval
Italy (cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 110).  He was born in 1194, in the little
hill town of Romano, and died in 1259.  Ezzelino extended his
cruel rule beyond the March of Treviso and over much of the
Venetian territory, as far as Mantua and Trent.

	|31.  D'una radice~: Of the same parents.  |ella~: The
^facella~ {v.29} (Ezzelino).

	|32.  Cunizza~: A sister of the Ghibelline Ezzelino III
da Romano and youngest daughter of Ezzelino II and Adelaide di
Mangona, Cunizza was born ca. 1198 and in 1222 was married, for
political reasons, to the Guelph captain Count Riccardo di San
Bonifazio of Verona.  Shortly after her marriage she became
enamored of the troubadour Sordello, by whom (ca. 1226), with the
connivance of her brother, she was abducted from Verona and
conveyed back to Ezzelino's court.  Her intrigue with Sordello
did not last long (although it appears to have been renewed later
at Treviso), and she then went to the court of her brother
Alberico at Treviso, where she abandoned herself to a knight
named Bonio, with whom, according to the old chronicler Rolandino
(^Cronica~, I, 3, p. 18) she wandered about the world, leading a
life of pleasure.

After the death of Bonio, who was slain while defending
Treviso on behalf of Alberico against his brother Ezzelino,
Cunizza was married by the latter to Aimerio, count of
Breganze; after his death, he having fallen a victim to a
quarrel with Ezzelino, she married a gentleman of Verona;
and subsequently she married a fourth husband in the person
of Salione Buzzacarini of Padua, Ezzelino's astrologer.  In
or about 1260, both Ezzelino and Alberico being dead, and
the fortunes of her house being at a low ebb, Cunizza went
to reside in Florence, where in 1265, in the house of
Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, the father of Dante's friend
Guido, she executed a deed granting their freedom to her
father's and brothers' slaves, with the exception of those
who had been concerned in the betrayal of Alberico.  In
1279, being then about eighty, she made her will, whereby
she bequeathed her possessions to the sons of Count
Alessandro degli Alberti of Mangona, her mother's family.
She probably died not long after this date, no further
mention of her having been preserved.

	|33.  esta stella~: Venus.

	|34-36.  ma lietamente~... |vulgo~: I condone the fact
that I was so much under the influence of the planet Venus,
indeed it pains me not at all (|e non mi noia~), which fact would
be hard (|forte~) for men on earth to understand.

	|37-39.  Di questa luculenta~... |rimase~: The reference
will soon be clear, for the light to whom she refers will be the
next to speak.

	|40.  questo centesimo anno ancor s'incinqua~: "This
centennial year shall yet be fived," shall return five times,
i.e., five centuries shall pass.  The year is 1300.

	|42.  altra vita~: |Altra vita~ (a life of fame on earth)
is the object of |relinqua~ ("shall leave").  Cf. ^Par.~ XVII,
98, 119-120.

	|43-44.  la turba presente~... |richiude~: The March of
Treviso is designated by the two rivers which bound it on east
and west respectively, the Tagliamento and the Adige.

	|46-48.  ma tosto fia~... |crude~: Padua is a city of
Venezia Euganea in northeast Italy, on the Bacchiglione (which
joins the Brenta a few miles south of Padua), west of Venice and
southeast of Vicenza.  It claims to be the oldest city in Italy
and to have been founded shortly after the fall of Troy by the
Trojan Antenor.  On February 12, 1237 Ezzelino IV da Romano, with
the help of Frederick II and the Ghibellines, obtained possession
of the city, but, on the proclamation of the crusade against him
by Pope Alexander IV in 1256, he was expelled by the Paduan
Guelphs and the Venetians.  After the death of Ezzelino in 1259,
the Guelphs of Padua asserted their independence and conquered
Vicenza (1265), whence, however, they were driven out, in 1314,
by Can Grande della Scala, who was at that time imperial vicar in
Vicenza.  |Vicenza~: Vicenza is a town in northern Italy, in
Venetia, on the Bacchiglione, northeast of Verona and northwest
of Padua.  The water that bathes it is the Bacchiglione, which
actually forms swamps around the city.  |per essere al dover le
genti crude~: "Because the people are stubborn against duty"
which is owed to the imperial authority.

	|49.  dove Sile e Cagnan s'accompagna~: The Sile and the
Cagnano (which is now known as the Botteniga) are two small
rivers in upper Italy in Venetia.  They unite at Treviso.

	|50-51.  tal signoreggia~... |ragna~: The reference is to
Rizzardo da Camino, son of Gherardo da Camino (see ^Purg.~ XVI,
124), whom he succeeded in the lordship of Treviso in 1306,
having shared the office with his father from 1300 on; he married
Giovanna, daughter of Nino Visconti of Pisa, and was (according
to the most trustworthy accounts) murdered in 1312 by a
half-witted servitor, while playing at chess in his own palace
with Alteniero degli Azzoni, who had planned the assassination in
order to avenge the honor of his wife, whom Rizzardo had seduced.

	|52-54.  Pianger@a Feltro~... |Malta~: The main facts of
the incident referred to appear to be as follows.  In 1314, while
Alessandro Novello of Treviso was bishop of Feltre (1298-1320),
certain Ferrarese Ghibellines of the house of Fontana, having
failed in a conspiracy against Pino della Tosa, King Robert's
vicar in Ferrara, took refuge in Feltre and placed themselves
under the protection of the bishop.  The latter, however, on the
requisition of Pino, delivered them up (in July of that year),
and they were taken back to Ferrara and publicly executed with
their confederates (thirty in all).  By this act of treachery the
bishop incurred such great odium that he was forced to quit
Feltre and retire into a monastery, where he died in 1320. 
|Malta~: Malta is the name of several different prisons.  On an
island in Lake Bolsena was a dungeon of that name, for guilty
prelates.  See the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~ under the entry
|Malta.~  See also M. Antonelli (1921).

	|55.  bigoncia~: "Vat."

	|59.  parte~: "Party" (Guelph).

	|61.  Troni~: The Thrones are the angels that direct the
seventh sphere, the heaven of Saturn.

	|62.  onde refulge a noi Dio giudicante~: These angels
are executors of God's judgments.  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 108, a. 6, resp.) notes: "^Throni~ dicuntur
secundum Gregorium... ^per quos Deus sua iudicia exercet.~" 
("The ^Thrones~, according to Gregory... are so called ^because
through them God accomplishes His judgments.~")  See Gregory,
^Homil.~ XXXIV, 10.

	|63.  s@i che questi parlar ne paion buoni~: "We see
mirrored in the Thrones the punishment that God has in store for
the sinners, and therefore we can speak with satisfaction of
their misdeeds" (Gr).

	|65.  rota~: The round dance of bright souls.

	|67.  letizia~: The happy spirit mentioned in vs. 37.

	|69.  balasso~: A kind of ruby that took its name from
the region in Asia from which it was imported, Arabic ^balaksh~,
the modern Persian province of Badakhshan.  |percuota~: The
subjunctive form expresses the hypothetical.

	|70.  Per letiziar l@a s@u fulgor s'acquista~: Cf. ^Par.~
V, 126.

	|71.  qui~: On earth.  |gi@u~: In Hell.  Some
commentators, however, take |gi@u~ to refer also to those on
earth.

	|73.  s'inluia~: A word made up by Dante, from the
pronoun ^lui~, meaning "hims itself," i.e., identifies itself
with him.  Cf. vs. 81 for other similar forms.

	|74-75.  nulla voglia~... |fuia~: "No wish can be a thief
of itself [can steal or secrete itself] from you," i.e., you can
see my wish in God.  For another example of |fuia~ in this sense,
cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 90.

	|77.  fuochi~: The Seraphim, ministers of divine love.

	|78.  sei ali~: For the six wings of the Seraphim, see
Isa. 6:2, and for the six wings of the fallen seraph, Satan,
see ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 46.  |coculla~: The gown and hood of a monk,
the whole outer garment.

	|81.  s'io m'intuassi, come tu t'inmii~: "If I could
^thou~ me, as thou ^meest~ thee."  The verbs are constructed, in
the same fashion as that in vs. 73, from |tu~ and |mi.~

	|82.  La maggior valle~: The Mediterranean, which was
thought to extend from west to east 90{degrees} or a quarter of the
earth's circumference.

	|84.  quel mar che la terra inghirlanda~: The great ocean
which was thought to surround all the land.

	|85.  discordanti~: "Inharmonious," varied.  |contra 'l
sole~: "As the opening of the sea is at the west end, it is
thought of as stretching from west to east" (Gr).

	|86-87.  che fa meridiano~... |suole~: "The meridian of any
place is a great circle passing through its zenith and nadir and the
two celestial poles.  The horizon of a place is a great heavenly circle
midway between its zenith and its nadir, the plane of the circle being
at right angles to that of the meridian.  The two circles are, then,
90+o~ apart.  When the water enters the Mediterranean, at the
Strait, its zenith is that of Gibraltar and its horizon traverses the
zenith of Jerusalem: but when it reaches the eastern end of the sea,
its meridian is that of Jerusalem and its horizon passes through the
zenith of Gibraltar" (Gr).

	|88.  litorano~: "Shore-dweller."

	|89-90.  tra Ebro e Macra~... |Toscano~: Between the
Spanish river Ebro and the Italian Magra or Macra.  Cf. ^Inf.~
XXIV, 145; ^Purg.~ VIII, 116.  The Magra, which under the Roman
Empire, from the time of Augustus, formed the boundary between
Liguria and Etruria, in Dante's day divided the Genoese territory
from Tuscany for a relatively short distance (|per cammin
corto~).

	|92.  Buggea~: Bougie, a town in North Africa, in
Algeria, on the gulf of the same name.  In the Middle Ages it was
a very important commercial port, its chief article of export
being wax and wax candles, whence the latter came to be known as
"bougies."  Bougie is situated about 115 miles east of Algiers
and is on almost the same meridian as Marseilles.  |la terra~:
The city, Marseilles.

	|93.  che f$e del sangue suo gi@a caldo il porto~: In 49
B.C. there was a fierce naval battle in the harbor of Marseilles
between Caesar's fleet and the local supporters of Pompey.  See
^Purg.~ XVIII, 101-102.  Also see ^Phars.~ III, 572-573, where
Lucan writes: "Cruor altus in unda / Spumat, et obducti concreto
sanguine fluctus."  ("Their blood foamed deep upon the wave, and
a crust of gore covered the sea.")

	|94.  folco~: Folquet de Marseille, famous Proven$cal
troubadour who flourished as a poet from 1180 to 1195, was born
ca. 1160 and died in 1231.  According to the old Proven$cal
biography, he was the son of a rich merchant of Genoa, who
bequeathed him a large fortune.  Devoting himself to a life of
pleasure, Folquet became a frequenter of courts, his special
patrons being Richard Coeur de Lion, Alfonso VIII of Castile,
Raymond V, count of Toulouse, and Barral de Baux, viscount of
Marseilles and lord of the city (1188-1192).  He attached himself
and paid court to the wife of the last, composing songs in her
honor, but she appears to have rejected his addresses.  After her
death and the deaths of the princes whose favor he had enjoyed,
Folquet retired from the world and became (ca. 1195) a Cistercian
monk; he persuaded his wife to enter a convent with their two
sons.  In 1201 he became an abbot in the diocese of Toulon and in
1205 was appointed bishop of Toulouse.  In the latter capacity he
was deeply implicated in the sanguinary persecution of the
Albigensian heretics (1208-1229).

	|96.  imprenta~: Cf. ^Par.~ VII, 69.  |com' io fe' di
lui~: "As I did [i.e., was stamped] with it."

	|97.  la figlia di Belo~: Dido.  See n. to ^Inf.~ V,
61-62.

	|98.  noiando e a Sicheo e a Creusa~: Dido, by her
passion for Aeneas, wronged her dead husband, Sichaeus, and
Aeneas' dead wife, Creusa.

	|99.  di me, infin che si convenne al pelo~: "Than I did,
as long as it befitted my hair," i.e., until I turned gray.

	|100-102.  n$e quella Rodopea~... |Demofoonte~: The
Thracian princess Phyllis, thinking herself forsaken by her lover
Demopho,on, son of Theseus, hanged herself.  Cf. Ovid ^Heroides~,
IX, 147-148.  |Rodopea~: Pronounced ^Rodop$ea.~  Rhodope is the
name of a mountain range on the edge of Thrace near which Phyllis
lived.  |n$e Alcide~... |rinchiusa~: Alcides was Hercules, grandson
of Alcaeus and son of Jupiter and Alcmene.  He lost his life as a
result of his infatuation for the Thessalian princess Iole.  See
Ovid, ^Heroides~, IX.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 67-68.

	|103-105.  Non per@o~... |provide~: "The memory of sin is
removed by Lethe, although the souls, seeing all things in God,
have an objective knowledge of their past wickedness, and
recognize the eternal fitness of the dispositions originally
given them by the stars" (Gr).  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 87; Augustine, ^De civ. Dei~, XXII, xxx,
4.  See also E. G. Gardner (1913), p. 73.  |per@o~ = ^perci@o.~ 
|valor~: Divine power.

	|106-107.  cotanto affetto~: The subject of |addorna~ of
which |l'arte~ is the object.  |discernesi~ = ^si discerne.~  |'l
bene~: The divine goodness.

	|108.  per che 'l mondo di s@u quel di gi@u torna~: "By
reason of which the world below [mankind] again becomes the world
above."  A difficult and much discussed line.  It should be
noted, in favor of this interpretation, that the verb (|torna~)
in rhyme must not have the same meaning in the two verses in
which it appears (a rule not to be violated).  The reference is
to the "harvest out of time" which comes about through the
turning of the spheres and their influence on human creatures,
and this is a result of God's love (|affetto~); for He, loving
Creator that He is, wishes every soul that He creates to return
to Him.  His providence works through the operation of the
spheres on the world below, whence the elect return to Him.

	|109.  piene~: "Entirely satisfied."

	|112.  lumera~: "Light."

	|114.  mera~ = ^pure.~

	|115-117.  Or sappi che~... |Raab~: "The story of Rahab
is related in Joshua ii.  When Joshua was trying to take Jericho,
he sent to the city two spies, who lodged in the house of `an
harlot named Rahab'.  Their presence becoming known to the enemy,
their hostess saved them by sending the pursuers on a false clue,
hiding her guests on the roof of the house, and, when the coast
was clear, letting them `down by a cord through the window, for
her house was upon the town wall.'  In return, they promised
safety for her and her relatives when Jericho should fall; as a
token, she was to `bind' a `line of scarlet thread in the
window.'  Her service resulted in the victory of the Children of
Israel; and when the city was cursed, Joshua proclaimed (vi, 17):
'Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her
in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.' 
Thus, too, she won salvation, and, according to Dante, was the
first soul `assumed' by the heaven of Venus, when the Hebrew
spirits were liberated from Limbus.  `Likewise also was not Rahab
the harlot justified by works,' says James, ii, 25, `when she
had received the messengers and had sent them out another way?' 
And in Hebrews, xi, 31, we read: `By faith the harlot Rahab
perished not with them that believed not.'  In the allegorical
exposition of the Scriptures, Joshua often figures as a symbol of
Christ, while Rahab is sometimes interpreted as the Church, which
he saved by the `scarlet thread' of his blood" (Gr).  |e a
nostr' ordine~... |si sigilla~: "`And, she being united to our
order, it (the order) is sealed with her in the highest degree.' 
Rahab is the supreme representative of our order of beatitude"
(Gr).

	|118-120.  Da questo cielo~... |face~: "The earth's
conical shadow reaches the sphere of Venus and touches the planet
when Venus is at its least, but not when it is at its greatest,
distance from our globe: cf. ^Conv.~ II, vi, 10.  The shadow,
according to Ptolemy and Alfraganus, is 871,000 miles long" (Gr). 
See P. Toynbee (1902), pp. 76-77; E. Moore (1903), p. 30.  The
shadow reaches no farther than Venus, hence it falls only over
the first three heavens, wherein are seen spirits who were too
much influenced by mundane inclinations.  |pria ch'altr'alma~...
|assunta~: The triumph of Christ here referred to is His
harrowing of Hell (cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 46-63), when (as we now learn)
Rahab was among those who were taken to Heaven by Christ, indeed,
was the first to be chosen for such a triumph.

	|121-123.  Ben si convenne~... |cielo~: "It was indeed
fitting to leave her, in some heaven."  This is to be understood
symbolically, of course, for Rahab dwells in the Empyrean with
all the blessed, but was "left in" (i.e., "assigned to") the
heaven of Venus (cf. ^Par.~ IV, 28-48) and accordingly has
descended with the other souls influenced by this planet to meet
the pilgrim on his upward way.  |l'alta vittoria~... |palma~:
Christ's great victory over Hell by the Crucifixion, when His
hands (^palme~) were nailed to the Cross.

	|124-125.  favor@o~ = ^favor@i.~  |la prima gloria~...
|Terra Santa~: Joshua was the successor of Moses and conqueror of
the land of Canaan.

	|126.  che poco tocca al papa la memoria~: Which (the
Holy Land) is well-nigh forgotten by the pope.  This judgment is
then repeated in vs. 137.

	|127-129.  La tua citt@a~... |pianta~: Florence is a
"plant" of the devil.  |che pria~... |pianta~: Satan was the
first creature to turn away from God, and in his fallen and evil
condition he envied Adam and Eve, causing them to sin -- with
such lamentable consequences for humankind.  |e di cui @e la
'nvidia tanto pianta~: See Sapien. 2:24: "Invidia autem
diaboli mors introivit in orbem terrarum."  ("But by the envy of
the devil, death entered the world.")  Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 111.

	|130.  il maladetto fiore~: The florin, coined by
Florence, which was imprinted on one side with the lily.

	|131.  le pecore e li agni~: The Christian flock.

	|132.  per@o che~ = ^perci@o che.~  |fatto ha lupo del
pastore~: Avidity for riches has turned the pope and
ecclesiastics generally into greedy wolves, and they thus set an
example for their flock.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 46-48; ^Purg.~ XVI,
100-102.

	|133-135.  Per questo~: Because of this greed for riches. 
|Per questo~... |studia~: The decretals are the papal decrees or
epistles, usually written in reply to some question of general
ecclesiastical law.  They form the groundwork of a large part of
the law of the Church.  A compilation of them, with additions of
his own, was issued by Pope Gregory IX in 1234 and, with further
additions, by Pope Boniface VIII in 1298 and again, in 1314, by
Pope Clement V.  Previously, sometime before 1150, Gratian of
Bologna had published his ^Decretum~, a general collection of
canons, papal epistles, and sentences of fathers, in imitation of
the ^Pandectae.~  This work appears to have been the chief
authority on the canon law in the Middle Ages.  The code of the
papal decretals was promulgated as the great statute law of
Christendom, superior in its authority to all secular laws.  The
book of Gregory's decretals was issued as the authorized text to
be used in all courts and schools of law.

	The dative |ai Decretali~ is used with |si studia~, as
with the Latin ^studere~, i.e., "men busy themselves about."  The
decretals are studied for financial profit.  Cf. Dante, ^Epist.~
XI, 16; ^De mon.~ III, iii, 9-11.  |s@i che pare a' lor vivagni~:
As is evident from their margins, full of notes and much worn.

	|136.  intende~: The verb in the singular serves a double
subject.

	|137-138.  Nazarette~... |l'ali~: Nazareth, in the Holy
Land, scene of the Annunciation, where Gabriel "opened his wings"
before Mary, in an attitude of homage which many painters have
represented.

	|139.  Vaticano~: The Vatican hill at Rome, on the right
bank of the Tiber, where St. Peter's basilica (San Pietro in
Vaticano) and the Vatican palace are located.  The latter has
been the usual residence of the popes ever since the return from
Avignon in the latter part of the fourteenth century, the papal
residence in Dante's time having been the Lateran palace.  The
Vatican hill, as having been the reputed scene of the martyrdom
of Peter and of numbers of the early Christians, is held to be
the most sacred quarter of all Rome.  |l'altre parti elette~: The
holy places of Rome, where the followers of Peter were tortured,
slain, and buried.

	|142.  avoltero~ = ^adult@ero, adulterio.~  Cf. ^Inf.~
XIX, 1-4; ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 37-45.
