	|1.  si parte~: "Is over."  ^Partire~ is used here in the
sense of "end," "break up."  Cf. Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ III, 1
(vol. I, p. 187, ll. 31-32): "Ma poi, partito il lor
ragionamento, cominci@o Masetto a pensare che via dovesse
tenere."  ("But then, when their conversation was ended, Masetto
began to think how he should set about the matter.")  |il gioco
de la zara~: L. Zdekauer (1886, pp. 24-25) has the following
account of this game of dice:

     I due gruppi principali del giuoco di fortuna nel medio evo
     sono adunque il giuoco de' dadi, e quello delle tavole.  Il
     tipo del primo @e il giuoco a zara.  Molto si @e detto su
     questa parola, senza arrivare ad una conclusione
     soddisfacente.  Dagli statuti pertanto risulta questo,
     ch'esso si giocava con 3 dadi, e generalmente senza
     tavoliero, sopra un banco od un piano qualunque, liscio,
     ("^discum pollitum,~" Firenze, St. d. 1285; v. Docum IV.
     Padova l. c. 785, ed altrove); e che, durante il giuoco,
     secondo certe combinazioni, la parola "azar" veniva
     proferita dai giuocatori stessi.  Quali fossero queste
     combinazioni, lo dice Iacopo della Lana, nel Commento di
     Dante, Purgat. VI, 1: cio@e tre e quattro, i numeri pi@u
     bassi, e 17 e 18, i pi@u alti.  Il particolare di questi
     tratti si @e, che essi non valgono; essi non vengono contati
     come numeri ("non sono computati"), ma soltanto come "zari"
     ("sono computati zari").  Di fronte a questi numeri peggiori
     stanno quelli, che hanno maggior probabilit@a, come i
     migliori.  "Quello numero" dice l'Ottimo nel commento al passo
     sopracitato del Purg., "che in pi@u modi pu@o venire, @e
     detta migliore volta di ragione."  Risulta dunque, che qui
     non si tratta di vincere col numero pi@u grande, essendo
     peggiori i numeri colla minima probabilit@a, anche se
     fossero alti ed invece migliori quelli, che possono venire
     in pi@u modi.  -- Ma oltre di questo @e certo, che non
     soltanto nel caso della "zara," ma ad ogni trar di dado
     proferivano un numero.  "Se io non avessi chiamato XI," dice
     il perditore nel commento di Iacopo della Lana "non avrei
     perduto."  E poi: "Io chiamavo cotal numero, che era
     ragionevole a dovere venir."  -- Ora il computo della
     probabilit@a ci dice, che i numeri colla massima
     probabilit@a fra le combinazioni di tre dadi, segnati ognuno
     dal No. 1 fino al No. 4 sono i numeri 10 e 11; 3 e 4, 17 e 18
     invece sono le combinazioni, che hanno la minima
     probabilit@a, a venire.  Atteso dunque, che il numero da
     farsi venne gridato prima di gettare i dadi, e che il
     miglior numero fosse quello che aveva la maggior
     probabilit@a a venire, concludiamo che la zara sia un giuoco
     di dadi, in cui vinceva colui, che facesse il numero gi@a
     proclamato ad alta voce da lui stesso, prima di gettare i
     dadi.  La particolarit@a sta in questo, che i numeri della
     minore probabilit@a sono chiamati e contati zeri.  Cos@i si
     spiega, come la parola "zara" potette acquistare il
     significato della combinazione sfavorevole, e del danno in
     generale.

     The two main forms of gambling in the Middle Ages were the
     game of dice and the game of ^tavole.~  The first takes the
     form of the game ^a zara.~  Much has been said about this
     word, but no satisfactory conclusion has been reached.  From
     the statutes, we learn that it was played with three dice,
     generally without a board, on a bench or on any smooth
     surface ("discum pollitum," Florence, St. d. 1285; cf.
     Docum. IV, Padua, l. c. 785, and elsewhere).  In the course
     of the game the players would say the word ^azar~ whenever
     certain combinations came out.  Jacopo della Lana, in his
     commentary on Dante (^Purg.~ VI, 1) tells us what these
     combinations were: three and four, the lowest numbers, and
     seventeen and eighteen, the highest.  The important thing
     about these throws is that they do not count.  They are not
     counted as numbers ("not computed") but only as ^zari~
     ("computed ^zari~").  These are the worst numbers; then
     there are the best, which are the numbers of highest
     probability.  The ^Ottimo~, in the commentary to the
     passage in ^Purgatory~ cited earlier, says: "The number that
     can come in many ways is said to be the best number."
     Clearly, then, the object is not to win with the highest
     number, since the worst are those with the minimum
     probability, even if they are high.  And the best are those
     that can come in several ways.  Furthermore, it is certain
     that they called a number at every throw of the dice, not
     only in the case of ^zara.~  "If I had not called eleven,"
     says the loser in the commentary of Jacopo della Lana, "I
     should not have lost."  And later: "I called that number
     because it was due to come up."  Now, according to the laws
     of probability, the numbers that have the best chance of
     being thrown by the three dice, each marked from one to
     four, are ten and eleven; on the other hand, three and four,
     and seventeen and eighteen have the minimum probability of
     turning up.  Since the number the thrower hoped would turn
     up was announced before throwing the dice, and since the
     best number was the one that had the highest probability of
     coming out, we conclude that ^zara~ was a game of dice in
     which the winner was the one who made the number which he
     had called aloud before throwing the dice.  There is this
     special feature: that the numbers of least probability are
     called and counted zero.  That explains why the word ^zara~
     could acquire the meaning of an unfavorable combination, and
     of harm in general.

N. Tamassia (1893, p. 456) calls attention to the following
passage in Odofredo, Bolognese doctor in jurisprudence, who died
in 1265: "Item sicut videmus in lusoribus ad taxillas vel similem
ludum, nam multi stare solent ad videndum ludum, et quando unus
lusorum obtinet in ludo, illi instantes solent petere aliquid
sibi dari de lucro illo in ludo habito, et illi lusores dare
solent."  ("Likewise we observe that, when people are playing
games of chance such as with dice, there will be a group standing
to watch the game, and when one of the players wins, they will
ask for a share of his profits and the players will always give
it to them.")

	|2.  colui che perde~: This figure of the loser, though
serving to make the whole scene more graphic, finds no
correspondence in the second term of the simile.  |si riman~: The
socalled pleonastic reflexive once more, in its usual function of
setting off the subject.

	|3.  repetendo le volte~: "Repeating the throws" to see how he
might have come out if he had had another chance.  Lana imagines the
loser saying: "Se io non avessi chiamato XI, non avrei perduto."  ("If
I had not called eleven, I should not have lost.")  See the quotation
from L. Zdekauer in n. to vs. 1.  |e tristo impara~: But learns all
too late.

	|4.  con l'altro~: With the winner.  |tutta la gente~:
All the onlookers.

	|6.  li si reca a mente~: Calls himself to his attention.
Cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 106.  |li~ = ^gli.~

	|7.  el~: The winner.  |intende~: "Gives heed to."  Vs.
11, in the second term of the simile, makes this clear.

	|8.  a cui~: A relative pronoun -- ^colui~ or ^quello~--
is understood: "quello a cui porge la man, pi@u non fa pressa."

	|11.  volgendo a loro, e qua e l@a, la faccia~: Dante is
obeying Virgil's previous order of ^Purg.~ V, 45: "per@o pur va,
e in andando ascolta."

	|12.  promettendo~: I.e., that he will ask their loved
ones among the living to pray for their speedier advance to
Purgatory Proper.

	|13-14.  l'Aretin... morte~: This is a reference to
Benincasa da Laterina (Laterina is in the upper Val d'Arno), a
judge who, according to the early commentators, while acting as
assessor for the ^podest@a~ of Siena, sentenced to death a
brother (or uncle) of Ghino di Tacco.  In revenge Ghino murdered
him while he was sitting in the papal audit office at Rome.  The
murder probably took place around 1297.

	|14.  Ghin di Tacco~: Famous highwayman.  Although the
date of his death is uncertain, he is thought to have died ^ca.~
1303.  See P. Toynbee (1968), pp. 313-14.  Boccaccio, who tells a
story of him in the ^Decameron~ (X, 2), calls Ghino "per la sua
fierezza e per le sue ruberie uomo assai famoso" ("a man very
famous on account of his fierceness and his thefts") in ^Decam.~
X, 2 (vol. 2, p. 241, ll. 8-9).

	|15.  e l'altro ch'anneg@o correndo in caccia~: This soul
is identified by the early commentators as Guccio de' Tarlati of
the Tarlati of Pietramala in the territory of Arezzo, in which
city they were the chiefs of the Ghibelline party.  According to
Benvenuto, he was the uncle of the celebrated Guido Tarlati,
bishop of Arezzo, and was drowned in the Arno, his horse having
run away with him, while he was in pursuit of some of the
Bostoli, Guelph exiles from Arezzo.  Other accounts, however,
state that he was drowned while trying to escape from the Bostoli
(after the battle of Campaldino, say some).  The phrase "in
caccia," in fact, lends itself to either interpretation, "in
flight" or "in pursuit"; see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 222, and the
phrase as used by Dino Compagni in his ^Cronica~ (I, 10): " [Gli
Aretini] furono messi in caccia, uccidendoli."  ("[The Aretines]
were pursued and killed.")

	|17.  Federigo Novello~: One of the Conti Guidi, son of
Guido Novello (hence he is Frederick junior of Guido junior).  He
is said to have been killed near Bibbiena in 1289 or 1291 by one
of the Guelph Bostoli of Arezzo, while helping the Tarlati of
Pietramala against the latter.  |quel da Pisa~: The son of
Messer Marzucco (see n. to vs. 18).

	|18.  Marzucco~: This personage was of an ancient noble
family originally from Scorno, and like his father, Scornigiano,
he held the title of judge and was charged with many delicate
offices within and without the city of Pisa (for more details,
see P. Toynbee, 1968, pp. 434-35).  In 1258 he married (for the
second time), and in April 1286 he declared himself a novice in
the Franciscan convent of Pisa, from which he seems to have
passed to the convent of Santa Croce in Florence.  In Florence he
served as a witness to documents dated October 10, 1291, August
17, 1293, September 1, 1295, and July 26, 1298, always with the
name ^Frater Marzuccus de Pisis~ or ^teste Fratre Marzucho
pisano.~  Marzucco thus appears to have lived his last years in
Florence at a time when Dante could have known him.  His wife
also entered a religious order, as is witnessed by a document of
October 28, 1301, in which she appears as "uxor olim domini
fratris Marzucci Scornigiani," which clearly witnesses the fact
that Marzucco was no longer living at that date.

	The commentators differ as to the details of the
circumstance alluded to by Dante; they are, however, for the most
part agreed upon one point, viz. that Marzucco had a son who was
murdered, and that he showed his fortitude in forgiving, instead
of avenging, the murder.

	The true facts of the incident referred to, in which "the
good Marzucco showed himself strong," are not available.  Strong
evidence points to the murder, in 1287, of one Gano Scornigiani
by Nino, known as "il Brigata" (see ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 89), grandson
of Count Ugolino, and by certain others who joined in with Nino
della Gherardesca.  However, the documents do not mention any son
of Marzucco by the name of Gano; they mention only a son named
Gallo by his first wife.  In any event, Gano was slain in 1287,
and Marzucco was already a novice in the Franciscan order in
1286.  Did Marzucco as a Friar Minor "show himself strong"? The
extant documents give no answer.

	|19.  conte Orso~: Orso degli Alberti della Cerbaia, son
of Count Napoleone degli Alberti.  According to Benvenuto he was
killed by his cousin Alberto, son of Count Alessandro degli
Alberti: "Iste comes Ursus fuit filius comitis Neapoleonis de
Acerbaia, qui acerbe fuit interfectus velut ursus tractatu
comitis Alberti de Mangona consobrini."  ("This Count Orso, the
son of Count Napoleone of Cerbaia, was viciously murdered by the
'bear mauling' of his cousin Alberto da Mangona.")  Pietro di
Dante gives a similar account, but without specifying the name of
the murderer: "Comes Ursus occisus proditorie a suis consortibus
et propinquis, fuit de Comitibus Albertis."  ("Count Orso, foully
murdered by his friends and relatives, was one of the Alberti.")
The murder of Count Orso by his cousin Alberto took place before
1286 and was doubtless, as Casini-Barbi suggests, a continuance
of the blood-feud which had existed between the fathers of the
two cousins, Napoleone and Alessandro, who killed each other.
See ^Inf.~ XXXII, 55-58, and n. to ^Inf.~ XXXII, 57.

	|20.  inveggia~ = ^invidia.~  The form is probably a
Proven$calism, from ^enveia.~  See E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 227.

	|21.  com' e' dicea~: A soul in Purgatory would tell the
truth, of course.  |commisa~ = ^commessa~: Cf. "miso" for
^messo~ in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 54.

	|22.  Pier da la Broccia~: Although according to
tradition Pierre de la Brosse was a surgeon of low birth, he was
actually a gentleman of Touraine of honorable extraction, who was
chamberlain and, for a time, favorite of Philip III of France.
He had already held the office of chamberlain to Philip's father,
Louis IX.  On the sudden death in 1276 of the heir to the throne
(Louis, Philip's son by his first wife, Isabella of Aragon), an
accusation was brought against the queen, Marie of Brabant, of
having poisoned Louis in order to secure the succession of her
own son.  Among her accusers was Pierre de la Brosse.

	In 1278 Pierre was suddenly arrested by order of the
king, and was hanged in that year.  The suddenness and ignominy
of his execution appear to have caused great wonder and
consternation, especially as the charge on which he was condemned
was not made known.  According to the popular account he had been
accused by the queen of an attempt upon her chastity.  The truth
seems to be that he was hanged on a charge of treasonable
correspondence with Alfonso X, King of Castile, with whom Philip
was at war, the intercepted letters on which the charge was based
having, it is alleged, been forged at the instance of the queen.
It is at any rate certain that Pierre was an object of envy and
hatred to the great nobles of Philip's court, and it is likely
enough that they made common cause with the queen in bringing
about his fall.  |qui~: Here on earth, among the
living.  |proveggia~ = ^proveda.~

	|23.  Brabante~: Brabant, ancient duchy of the
Netherlands, covering the territory of what is now the southern
Netherlands and central and northern Belgium; now the name of a
province in central Belgium.  Dante thus urges Marie (see n. to
vs. 22) to repent of having caused Pierre's death while she yet
has time (vss. 22-24).  She died in 1321, in the same year as
Dante, and thus could have read this warning.

	|24.  s@i che per@o non sia di peggior greggia~: That she
not find herself in a far worse flock (i.e., among the damned of
Hell) than this in which Pierre is, in Purgatory.  Clearly Marie,
should she die unrepentant of this sin and accordingly be
sentenced by Minos, might well find herself in company with
Potiphar's wife, in the tenth ditch of Malebolge (^Inf.~ XXX,
97).  |per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~

	|26.  pregar~ = ^pregarono.~  |pur~: "Only," i.e., for nothing
else.  Cf. vs. 31.  |altri~: A singular pronoun that is, in
the context, plural in meaning.  |prieghi~: Present
subjunctive of ^pregare.~

	|27.  s@i che s'avacci lor divenir sante~: "Lor divenir
sante" is the subject of the verb.  They pray that their becoming
blessed (in Paradise) may be hastened.  For another example of
^avacciare~, see ^Purg.~ IV, 116.

	|28.  El~: An impersonal subject pronoun, sometimes
called pleonastic.

	|28-30.  El par che tu... pieghi~: The reference is to
Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 337-83, where Aeneas encounters the shade of
Palinurus, who prays, as one whose body has not received burial,
to be taken across the Stygian waves that he may find a quiet
resting-place.  The Sibyl (termed "vates" in vs. 372) answers
(^Aen.~ VI, 373-76):

     ...unde haec, o Palinure, tibi tam dira cupido?  
     tu Stygias inhumatus aquas amnemque severum 
     Eumenidum aspicies ripamve iniussus adibis?  
     desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.

     Whence, O Palinurus, this wild longing of thine?  Shalt thou,
     unburied, view the Stygian waters and the Furies' stern
     river, and unbidden draw near the bank?  Cease to dream that
     heaven's decrees may be turned aside by prayer.

	|29.  o luce mia~: Later in this canto Beatrice is called
a "lume" (vs. 45).  |in alcun testo~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 113:
"in alcun loco"; ^Purg.~ IV, 80: "in alcun' arte."

	|30.  che decreto del cielo orazion pieghi~: "Decreto del
ciel" is the object of the verb, "orazion" is the subject.

	|31.  pur~: Cf. vs. 26.

	|32.  sarebbe dunque loro speme vana~: The hope of these
souls is expressed in vss. 26-27.

	|34.  La mia scrittura @e piana~: For ^piano~ in this
sense, see ^Purg.~ XVIII, 85.

	|35.  non falla~: "Is not fallacious."

	|37.  ch$e cima di giudicio non s'avvalla~: Grandgent
translates this "the summit of justice (^apex iuris~) is not
overturned" and recalls Shakespeare, ^Measure for Measure~, Act
II, sc. ii, ll. 75-77:

     ...  How would you be
     If he which is the top of judgment should
     But judge you as you are? ...

^s'avvalla~: Virgil's verb is "flecti" (see quotation in n. to
vss. 28-30); Dante phrases it as "pieghi" (vs. 30).

	|38.  perch$e foco d'amor compia~: "Though fire of love
fulfill."  The debt owed the Deity is essentially a debt of love,
as this verse suggests.  In praying for those in Purgatory, the
living can (provided they are ^in grazia~) contribute "payments"
toward the satisfaction of this debt.  |in un punto~: "In a
moment" posits the extreme or limiting case, hence "perch$e"
("though").  If enough love were contributed toward the debt by
the living, it might in one moment, or instantly, absolve it.  It
follows from this that it can also be satisfied gradually, by
installments.

	|39.  de'~ = ^deve.~  |s'astalla~: "Has his ^stallo~" (cf.
^Inf.~ XXXIII, 102), or place of sojourn, here.

	|40.  fermai~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 99.

	|41-42.  non s'ammendava... disgiunto~: Palinurus, to
whose prayers in ^Aen.~ VI, 363-71 Virgil here refers, was a
pagan, living in the period between the Fall and the Redemption,
a time, that is, in which God's grace (with notable exceptions)
was withdrawn from mankind.  See ^Par.~ XXXII, 82, "ma poi che 'l
tempo de la grazia venne," i.e., when grace returned to man
through Christ's sacrifice, which, by clear implication, makes
the time before Christ a time "without grace."  See also ^Purg.~
IV, 133-35.

	|43.  Veramente~: Nevertheless.  |alto sospetto~: Deep
question, i.e., one involving matters such as grace, which
transcend Virgil's understanding.  Virgil will continue to refer
to Beatrice along the way of the purgatorial journey: see ^Purg.~
XV, 76-78; XVIII, 46-48.

	|45.  che lume fia tra 'l vero e lo 'ntelletto~: When
Beatrice came to him in Limbo (^Inf.~ II), Virgil recognized her
as that lady through whom mankind transcends all that lies
beneath the moon.  Now she is said to be a light between the
truth and the intellect.  Again and again she will be termed a
light: all of which serves to point to Beatrice's meaning in
allegory.  Virgil also is frequently referred to as a light, as
in vs. 29, above.

	|47-48.  tu la vedrai... monte~: Through such verses as
these, Beatrice is seen as the goal at the summit of the
mountain, and the journey thither thus becomes a journey to
Beatrice.  See C. S. Singleton (1958).

	|48.  ridere e felice~: M. Barbi (1934a, pp. 39-41)
offers a justification of this rather unusual construction in
which an infinitive and an adjective can both depend on a verb,
as on ^vedere~ here.  See ^Purg.~ XII, 35.

	|51.  e vedi omai che 'l poggio l'ombra getta~: Virgil
and Dante are climbing the mountain on its eastern slope and
therefore in the early afternoon are on its shady side.

	|52.  con questo giorno innanzi~: For as long as day
lasts.

	|54.  ma 'l fatto @e d'altra forma che non stanzi~: In
fact, if Virgil knows how long it will take him and his charge to climb
this mountain, he would appear to be deliberately withholding this
discouraging fact from Dante.  And yet Virgil does not seem to know the
entire "fact" himself, i.e., that there is actually no climbing the
mountain at night.  See ^Purg.~ VII, 49-51.  stanzi~: "Think,"
"judge."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 10, where the word bears the meaning
"decree."

	|56.  colui che gi@a si cuopre de la costa~: The sun.

	|57.  s@i che ' suoi raggi tu romper non fai~: Dante,
being now in the shadow of the mountain, no longer intercepts the
rays of the sun.

	|59.  sola soletta~: The repetition of the adjective
begins the stress on the apartness of this spirit, as does the
fact that it is seated, for all the other souls seen in this area
of Ante-purgatory have been moving about in groups.  Moreover, the
suffix -^etta~ adds a touch as of endearing sentiment.

	|60.  la via pi@u tosta~: The quickest way, which
suggests that it is still necessary for Virgil and Dante to make
their way across rough terrain.

	|61.  o anima lombarda~: The exclamation is uttered by
the Poet as he sees again, in memory, this soul seated alone on
the slope.  The apostrophe which then follows (vss. 76-151) is
voiced out of this same focus on the figure.

	|62.  come ti stavi~: "Ti" here is an excellent example
of the "distancing" reflexive.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 94; VIII, 48;
and ^passim.~  |altera e disdegnosa~: Landino comments:

     In nostra lingua diciamo altiero, e disdegnoso colui, che
     per eccellentia d'animo non risguarda, n@e pon pensiero, a
     cose vili, n@e quelle degna.  S@i che dimostra una certa
     schifezza generosa, e senza vitio.  Perci@o che quando uno
     sprezza non per grandezza d'animo, ma per troppa alterigia,
     non altiero, ma superbo si chiamer@a.

     In our language, we use the words ^altiero~ (lofty) and
     ^disdegnoso~ (disdainful) of the man whose excellence of
     spirit is such that he completely ignores vile things and
     will not stoop to them.  Such a man shows fastidiousness
     that is generous and without taint.  But if a man is
     scornful not out of magnanimity but out of arrogance we call
     him not ^altiero~, but ^superbo~ (haughty).

	|63.  e nel mover de li occhi onesta e tarda~: Cf.
^Inf.~ IV, 112: "Genti v'eran con occhi tardi e gravi"; also see
^Purg.~ III, 10-11.

	|65.  lasciavane gir~ = ^ci lasciava andare.~  |sguardando~:
The verb ^sguardare~ suggests gazing rather than direct, intent
looking.

	|66.  a guisa di leon quando si posa~: The simile may
have a literary source for Dante.  Cf. Gen. 49:9: "Requiescens
accubuisti ut leo."  ("He crouches and couches as a lion.")  But
it could well come from the direct observation of a lion in a
cage as it lies gazing distantly at or beyond the human creatures
who stand looking at it.  Lions were kept in several city zoos in
Italy at the time and are known to have been kept in Florence in
Dante's time and later.

	|67.  Pur~: May mean either "only" (i.e., Virgil
advances, leaving Dante somewhat behind) or "nonetheless" (i.e.,
in spite of this soul's "distant" attitude), which seems more
probable.

	|68.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|70.  de la vita~: Of our former condition among the
living.  The soul has not perceived that Dante is here in the
flesh, since now, in the shade of the mountain, no shadow is cast
by his body.

	|71.  ci 'nchiese~ = ^ci inchiese~ (^ci richiese~).  |e 'l
dolce duca incominciava~: The charge of sentiment which soon
will run so high, in the scene of the embrace, is already showing
itself in the adjective "dolce" and in the fact that the scene
itself is framed descriptively, by the verb in the imperfect,
rather than in the narrative past absolute -- and so on to the
climax "abbracciava," vs. 75.

	|72.  Mantua...~: No doubt Virgil would have said "Mantua
fu la mia patria," thus answering the first part of the question
addressed to him.  Benvenuto, in his Latin, can think that he
would have said "Mantua me genuit," thus echoing the epitaph
written for Virgil: see n. to ^Purg.~ III, 27.  |tutta in
s$e romita~: Cf. vss. 58-59; now, by this effective touch, the
physical apartness is made a psychological apartness: the soul
was "in s$e romita" ("in himself recluse") and now rises out of
such a condition ^and~ out of the ^place~ where it is (the
physical place, vs. 73) to embrace Virgil.

	|74.  Sordello~: Sordello, one of the most distinguished
among the Italian poets who elected to write in Proven$cal rather
than in their mother-tongue, was born at Goito, some ten miles
from Mantua, about the year 1200.  He led a chequered and
wandering life, the latter portion of which was devoted to the
service of Charles of Anjou, by whom he was well rewarded.  The
latest record of him that has come down to us is dated 1269.  To
the Dante student one episode of Sordello's life and one of his
poems are of special interest.  Between the years 1227-29, while
staying at Treviso with Ezzelino III da Romano, he had a liaison
with the latter's sister Cunizza (see ^Par.~ IX, 25-36), who was
the wife of Count Riccardo di San Bonifazio, but whom Sordello
had abducted (for political reasons) at the request of her
brother.  When the latter discovered the intrigue, Sordello was
forced to flee to Provence.  About the year 1240 he wrote a very
fine ^planch~ (or song of lamentation) on the death of Blacatz,
himself a poet and one of the barons of Count Raymond Berenger
IV.  In this poem the leading sovereigns and princes of Europe
are exhorted to eat of the dead man's heart, so that their
courage may increase, and they be fired on to noble deeds.  These
verses may have indirectly inspired the patriotic outburst for
which the appearance of Sordello is made the pretext; and they
certainly induced Dante to assign to Sordello the task of
pointing out the princes in the following canto.  There is a
reference to Sordello in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, xv, 2.

	This information is provided by the Temple Classics
edition of the ^Purgatorio~; see P. Toynbee (1968), pp. 585-88,
for further details.  Of the office assigned to Sordello,
Benvenuto, commenting on ^Purg.~ VII, 69, says:

     Nota quod poeta pulcre fingit quod Sordellus duxerat istos
     poetas ad videndum istos viros illustres, quia fuit homo
     curialis et curiosus investigator et admirator omnium
     valentum sui temporis et omnium virtutes et mores sciebat et
     referebat.

     We should notice how beautifully the poet portrays
     Sordello's bringing the poet to visit these illustrious men;
     he did so because he was a courtier and a diligent observer
     and admirer of the great men of his times, and he knew and
     related all about the virtues and conduct of his
     contemporaries.

	|75.  e l'un l'altro abbracciava~: Cf. n. to vs. 71; the
following apostrophe thus arises out of this descriptive focus,
out of this "picture" as relived in memory by the poet now.

	|76.  serva Italia~: Italy, formerly "mistress of
provinces," would be free if she were ruled by an emperor, as God
intended.  In ^De mon.~ I, xii, 6-8, Dante writes:

     Hoc viso, iterum manifestum esse potest quod hec libertas
     sive principium hoc totius libertatis nostre, est maximum
     donum humane nature a neo collatum: quia per ipsum hic
     felicitamur ut homines, per ipsum alibi felicitamur ut dii.
     Quod si ita est, quis erit qui humanum genus optime se
     habere non dicat, cum potissime hoc principio possit uti?
     Sed existens sub Monarcha est potissime liberum.

     When we see this we may further understand that this freedom
     (or this principle of all our freedom) is the greatest gift
     conferred by God on human nature; for through it we have our
     felicity here as men, through it we have our felicity
     elsewhere as deities.  And if this be so, who would not
     agree that the human race is best disposed when it has
     fullest use of this principle?  But it is under a monarch
     that it is most free.

See also Dante's letter addressed to the infamous Florentines who
resist the Emperor Henry VII (^Epist.~ VI, 5):

     Vos autem divina iura et humana transgredientes, quos dira
     cupiditatis ingluvies paratos in omne nefas illexit, nonne
     terror secunde mortis exagitat, ex quo, primi et soli iugum
     libertatis horrentes, in romani Principis, mundi regis et
     Dei ministri, gloriam fremuistis, atque iure prescriptionis
     utentes, debite subiectionis officium denegando, in
     rebellionis vesaniam maluistis insurgere?

     But you, who transgress divine and human law, whom a dire
     rapaciousness hath found ready to be drawn into every crime,
     -- doth not the dread of the second death pursue you?  For ye
     first and alone, shunning the yoke of liberty, have murmured
     against the glory of the Roman prince, the king of the world
     and the minister of God, and on the plea of prescriptive
     right have refused the duty of the submission which ye owed,
     and have rather risen up in the insanity of rebellion!

	|77.  nave sanza nocchiere~: The helmsman is the emperor.
See ^Conv.~ IV, iv, 5-7, where Dante says:

     Si come vedemo in una nave, che diversi offici e diversi
     fini di quella a uno solo fine sono ordinati, cio@e a
     prendere loro desiderato porto per salutevole via: dove, s@i
     come ciascuno officiale ordina la propria operazione nel
     proprio fine, cosi @e uno che tutti questi fini considera, e
     ordina quelli ne l'ultimo di tutti; e questo @e lo
     nocchiero, a la cui voce tutti obedire deono.  Questo vedemo
     ne le religioni, ne li esserciti, in tutte quelle cose che
     sono, come detto @e, a fine ordinate.  Per che
     manifestamente vedere si pu@o che a perfezione de la
     universale religione de la umana spezie conviene essere uno,
     quasi nocchiero, che considerando le diverse condizioni del
     mondo, ne li diversi e necessarii offici ordinare abbia del
     tutto universale e inrepugnabile officio di comandare.  E
     questo officio per eccellenza Imperio @e chiamato, sanza
     nulla addizione, per@o che esso @e di tutti li altri
     comandamenti comandamento.  E cos@i chi a questo officio @e
     posto @e chiamato Imperadore, per@o che di tutti li
     comandamenti elli @e comandatore, e quello che esso dice a
     tutti @e legge, e per tutti dee essere obedito e ogni altro
     comandamento da quello di costui prendere vigore e
     autoritade.

     Even as we see in a ship that the divers offices and divers
     ends of it are ordained to one single end, to wit the making
     of the desired port by a prosperous voyage; wherein, like as
     each officer regulates his proper function to its proper
     end, there is one who considers all these ends and regulates
     them with a view to the final end; and he is the shipmaster,
     whose voice all are bound to obey.  And we see the same
     thing in religious orders, and in armies, and in all things
     which are ordained, as aforesaid, to some end.  Whereby it
     may be manifestly seen that for the perfection of the
     universal religious order of the human race it behoves that
     there should be one, as shipmaster, who, considering the
     diverse conditions of the world, and ordaining the diverse
     and necessary offices, should have the universal and
     indisputable office of commanding the whole.  And this
     office is called by pre-eminence empire, without any
     qualification, because it is the command of all the other
     commands.  And hence he who is appointed to this office is
     called emperor because he is the commander who issues all
     the commands.  And what he says is law to all, and he ought
     to be obeyed by all, and every other command draws its
     strength and authority from his.

	|78.  non donna di provincie~: See Lam. 1:1: "Quomodo
sedet sola civitas plena populo! facta est quasi vidua domina
gentium; princeps provinciarum facta est sub tributo."  ("How
doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! How is the
mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princes of
provinces made tributary!")  For the phrase as traditionally
applied to Italy, derived from the ^Corpus iuris civilis~ of
Justinian (see n. to vss. 88-89), see the quotation provided by
F. Ercole (1913, p. 172, n. 2): "L'Italia non pu@o essere
tributaria di alcuno, perch@e sta scritto nelle leggi: ^non est
provincia~ etc."  ("Italy cannot be the tributary of anyone,
because it is written in the laws: it is not a province, etc.")
Cf. Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ VII, iv, 6 (p. 216): "La
nobile provincia d'Italia: la quale @e donna di tutte le
provincie, che per la sua nobilt@a ingeneraro la grande Roma, la
quale signoreggi@o e fu donna di tutte le citt@a."  ("The noble
province of Italy is mistress of all the provinces, which through
her nobility gave birth to the great city of Rome, which ruled
and was mistress of all the cities.")

	^ma bordello~: Literally, ^bordello~ is a house of
prostitution, but in this context the term denotes,
metaphorically, a prostitute.  Cf. Isa. 1:21: "Quomodo facta est
meretrix, civitas fidelis, plena iudicii?" ("How is the faithful
city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot?") See ^Conv.~
I, ix, 5: "l'hanno fatta di donna meretrice" ("have made her a
harlot instead of a lady").

	|81.  quivi~: In Purgatory, among the dead, as is made
clear by the contrasting "in te" of the following verse.

	|83.  li vivi tuoi~: In contrast with the two Mantuan
souls there, among the dead.

	|85-86.  intorno da le prode le tue marine~: The regions
near your shores.

	|86.  e poi ti guarda in seno~: And then consider your
regions within.

	|88-89.  Che val perch$e... Iustiniano~: Justinian, emperor of
Constantinople from 527 to 565.  He appointed a commission of jurists
to draw up a complete body of law, which resulted in the compilation of
two great works; one, called ^Digesta~ or ^Pandectae~ (533), in fifty
books, contained all that was valuable in the works of preceding
jurists; the other, called ^Codex constitutionum~, consisted of a
collection of the imperial constitutions.  To these two works was
subsequently added an elementary treatise in four books, under the
title of ^Institutiones~ (533); and at a later period Justinian
published various new constitutions, to which he gave the name of
^Novellae constitutiones~ (534-65).  These four works, under the
general name of ^Corpus iuris civilis~, form the Roman law as received
in Europe, and it is to this work that Dante here makes special
allusion.  Cf. ^Par.~ VI, 12.

	|89.  se la sella @e v@ota~: Cf. ^Conv.~ IV, ix, 10,
where (after a direct reference to the ^Digesta~ -- "Vecchio
Digesto" -- of Justinian) Dante continues:

     S@i che quasi dire si pu@o de lo Imperadore, volendo lo suo
     officio figurare con una imagine, che elli sia lo
     cavalcatore de la umana volontade.  Lo quale cavallo come
     vada sanza lo cavalcatore per lo campo assai @e manifesto, e
     spezialmente ne la misera Italia, che sanza mezzo alcuno a
     la sua governazione @e rimasa!

     Wherefore we may in some sort say of the emperor, if we wish
     to figure his office by an image, that he is the rider of
     the human will.  And how that horse courses over the plain
     without the rider is manifest enough, and especially in the
     wretched Italy which, without any mediator at all, has been
     abandoned to her own direction.

	|90.  Sanz' esso~: Without the bridle, which Justinian
had "refitted."

	|91-92.  Ahi gente... sella~: In denouncing the cause of
Italy's woeful plight the poet turns first to the "people" of the
Church, popes and ecclesiastics in power, who ought to be
"devout," that is, heed the precepts of God (vs. 93); on this,
see the whole thesis of the third book of the ^De monarchia.~

	|93.  se bene intendi ci@o che Dio ti nota~: Cf. Matt.
22:21: "Tunc ait illis: Reddite ergo quae sunt Caesaris Caesari,
et quae sunt Dei Deo."  ("Then he said to them, 'Render,
therefore, to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the
things that are God's.'")

	|94.  fiera~: The metaphor of the horse continues.  |fella~:
See vs. 98: "indomita e selvaggia."

	|97.  Alberto tedesco~: Albert I of Austria, son of
Rudolf I of Habsburg, was emperor (but never crowned), 1298-1308.
He was elected after he had defeated and, it was rumored, slain
his predecessor, Adolf of Nassau, in a battle at G,ollheim.
Finally, in 1303, his election was recognized by Boniface VIII in
consideration of the advantages of his alliance against the
pope's mortal enemy, Philip the Fair of France.  On May 1, 1308,
he was assassinated by his nephew John.

	|100-102.  giusto giudicio da le stelle... n'aggia~: What
this judgment might be is left obscure, nor is it possible to
ascertain that the poet, writing after the assassination of
Albert (1308) or the death of his eldest son the year before,
would be alluding to those calamities.  On Dante's chronological
perspective, see E. G. Parodi (1920), pp. 453-54:

     Ricordiamoci che Dante, nemmeno nel canto sesto,
     nell'invettiva che fa in nome proprio, non si allontana
     dalla sua finzione cronologica del 1300, ossia, come mi sono
     gi@a espresso "si colloca idealmente, anche qual narratore
     del proprio viaggio, in un punto di tempo che gli permette
     di considerare il presente o il non lontano passato come
     futuro, e allo scrittore non toglie del tutto i preziosi
     vantaggi di cui godeva il pellegrino dei regni
     oltremondani!"

     Let us remember that Dante never departs from the
     chronological fiction of 1300 -- not even in the sixth canto,
     during that invective delivered in his own name.  As I have
     said before, even as the narrator of his own voyage, he
     places himself ideally at a point in time that allows him to
     view the present or the not very distant past as future.  He
     does not completely take away from the writer those precious
     advantages enjoyed by the pilgrim in the world beyond.

	|102.  tuo successor~: Albert's successor was Henry VII,
emperor from 1308 to 1313, but if, as advocated by E. G. Parodi
(see quotation in preceding note), we hold to the point of view
adopted by the poet as he utters this invective, this fact is not
yet known.  |aggia~ = ^abbia.~

	|103.  ch'~ = ^ch$e~ (^perch$e~) or ^che~ without the accent
in an attenuated "because," translatable by "for" in English.
|'l tuo padre~: Rudolf I, emperor from 1273 to 1291.  For the
reproach, as it applies to him, see ^Purg.~ VII, 94-96.

	|104.  per cupidigia~ = ^da cupidigia.~  |cost@a~: Up there,
in Germany, where Albert is.  See Villani, VII, 146: "Sempre
intese a crescere suo stato e signoria in Alamagna, lasciando le
'mprese d'Italia per accrescere terra e podere a' figliuoli."
("Always intent upon augmenting his power and lordship in
Germany, he undertook nothing in Italy, so that he might increase
the lands and possessions of his sons.")

	|106.  Montecchi~: The Montecchi family gave its name to
the imperial party, or faction of the Monticoli (Dante has
Tuscanized the name), which was headed, from ^ca.~ 1235 to 1259,
by Ezzelino III da Romano in his attempt to conquer Lombardy.
Thus the Monticoli, as the name of a party, became synonymous
with "friends of Ezzelino."  The focal point of the struggle
between the imperial and anti-imperial parties passed (^ca.~
1247) to Cremona, where the anti-imperial party had long borne
the name of Cappelletti.

	The Monticoli, originally a merchant family, by the
acquisition of vast estates became politically very powerful; by
1195, their name already designates a faction in the political
life of Verona.  And, as the faction of the Monticoli was
absorbed into that of Ezzelino, it gradually extended the theater
of its interests into all of Lombardy.  By 1291, the Monticoli
party was dead in Verona, the Della Scala family having gained
control after the death of Ezzelino (1259).

	In his invective against "servile Italy," Dante
sarcastically invites the Emperor Albert to come and see the
Montecchi and the Cappelletti, who are already "tristi" (vs.
108).  The meaning of these verses was the subject of extensive
debate until a thorough study of the question by F. Ghisalberti
(1935) placed the entire matter in its proper historical focus.
In his conclusion, Ghisalberti observes (p. 67):

     Infatti sulla fine del secolo XIII la lotta che aveva
     dilaniato l'alta Italia era venuta assumendo un altro
     aspetto.  I partiti erano finiti come tali, e il loro
     programma si poteva considerare fallito.  Monticoli e
     Capelleti non erano ormai pi@u che nomi di vinti.  Ambedue
     avevano agitato nelle loro origini le aspirazioni del popolo
     e della borghesia mercantile, assertori entrambi della
     libert@a e autonomia del Comune.  Ma nel processo degli
     avvenimenti avevano finito per lasciarsi attirare nella
     sfera di interessi signorili, e troppo tardi s'erano accorti
     d'essersi dati dei padroni....

     Cos@i verso il 1300 Dante poteva benissimo considerare che i
     colori di quelle fazioni fossero affatto cancellati dalla
     carta politica di Lombardia, e dire quindi ad Alberto
     tedesco:

     Vieni a veder Montecchi e Cappelletti,
     Monaldi e Filippeschi, uom sanza cura:
     color gi@a tristi, e questi con sospetti!

     invitandolo cos@i sarcasticamente a fare un viaggio per
     constatare gli effetti della sua colpevole assenza.

     In fact, toward the end of the thirteenth century, the
     struggle that was tearing apart northern Italy had taken on
     a different aspect.  The factions were finished as such, and
     their program could be considered a failure.  Monticoli and
     Cappelletti were by now nothing more than the names of the
     vanquished.  Both, when they started out, had excited the
     hopes of the people and of the merchant bourgeoisie, which
     in turn were the forces behind the liberty and autonomy of
     the commune.  But in the course of events, they allowed
     themselves to be drawn into the sphere of aristocratic
     interests; and when they realized they had subjugated
     themselves, it was too late....

     And so, in about the year 1300, Dante could easily consider
     the colors of those factions quite erased from the political
     map of Lombardy.  Thus he could say to Alberto Tedesco:
     "Come, you that have no care, and see Montecchi and
     Cappelletti, Monaldi and Filippeschi, those already wretched
     and these in dread" -- sarcastically inviting him to take a
     trip, to view the effects of his reprehensible absence.

Luigi da Porto's ^Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili
amanti, con la lor pietosa morte~ (published at Venice ^ca.~
1530; adapted from a story by Masuccio Salernitano, ^Novellino~
33 published at Naples in 1476), with its setting in Verona and
its young protagonists named Romeo and Giulietta, of the feuding
families of the Montecchi and Cappelletti (Da Porto thus
misconstruing the meaning of Dante's verses), became, through
Matteo Bandello's version (1554), Shakespeare's source for ^Romeo
and Juliet.~

	^Cappelletti~: A Guelph party of Cremona (not, as has
commonly been supposed, a Cremonese family).  There is frequent
mention of this party in the chronicles, between 1249 and 1266,
and of their struggles against the Monticoli party for political
supremacy in Lombardy.

	The Cappelletti party was ultimately victorious over the
Emperor Henry VII.  Although in control of Cremona from 1300 to
1321, it was, by 1290, greatly on the wane as the anti-imperial
party throughout Lombardy and accordingly, together with the
Monticoli, was designated as "tristi."

	|107.  Monaldi~: Guelph family of Orvieto, otherwise
known as Monaldeschi.  |Filippeschi~: Ghibelline family of
Orvieto.  These two families were the leaders, respectively, of
the Ghibellines and Guelphs in Orvieto, and were in consequence
continually at variance.  In April 1312, the Filippeschi,
emboldened by the approach of the Emperor Henry VII, attacked the
Monaldi, but were worsted and expelled from the city with the
rest of the Ghibellines.  Subsequently, in 1337, the tyranny of
the Monaldi led to their own expulsion.

	|109.  la pressura~: Cf. Luc. 21:23: "Erit enim pressura
magna super terram."  ("For there will be great distress over the
land.")

	|110.  d'i tuoi gentili~: Buti comments: "cio@e de'
conti, marchesi et altri gentili omini e signori d'Italia" ("that
is, of counts, marquises, and other lords and gentlemen of
Italy").

	|111.  Santafior~: Santafiora, county and town in Sienese
territory, just under Monte Amiata, at the head of the river
Fiora, which from the ninth century down to 1300 belonged to the
powerful Ghibelline family of the Aldobrandeschi, who thence took
their title of counts of Santafiora.  It was formerly an imperial
fief, but at the time Dante wrote it was in the hands of the
Guelphs of Siena.  See G. Ciacci (1935), pp. 335-59.  Also see F.
Ghisalberti (1935), pp. 68-69:

     Che se poi il sacro imperatore avesse voluto rendersi conto
     di quei nobili che da lui avevan ricevuto solenne
     investitura, ecco:

     Vien, crudel vieni, e vedi la pressura
       de' tuoi gentili, e cura lor magagne;
       e vedrai Santafior com'@e oscura.

     Anche qui un esempio solo che schiude un'altra vista
     disastrosa, e scopre un altro aspetto della multiforme
     anarchia: i diritti gentilizi calpestati, la nobilt@a
     "battuta e punta" e magagnata.  L@a dove un giorno s'apriva
     ai sovrani lo splendido feudo del superbo e fiero Omberto
     Aldobrandeschi, avrebbe visto un'oscura terra, ridotta alle
     estreme difese dalla cupidigia dei potenti vicini (e la mano
     di Bonifazio anche qui non era stata inoperosa) e
     soprattutto dalla Signoria popolare di Siena.

     For if the holy emperor had wanted to find out what happened
     to those noblemen who received solemn investiture at his
     hands, behold: "Come, cruel one, come and see the distress
     of your nobles and cure their hurts; and you will see how
     forlorn Santafiora is!"  Here, too, a single example unveils
     another disastrous vista, and uncovers another aspect of the
     multiform anarchy: noble privilege trampled upon, the
     nobility "vanquished and wounded" and in decay.  In the
     place of what was once the splendid fief of the proud and
     fierce Omberto Aldobrandeschi, he would now have seen a dark
     land, reduced to extremity by the greed of its powerful
     neighbors (nor had the hand of Boniface been idle there),
     above all by the middle-class ^signoria~ of Siena.

See G. Fatini (1922), pp. 42-46.

	|113.  vedova e sola~: See n. to vs. 78.  |chiama~:
Cf. the Latin ^clamat.~

	|114.  accompagne~ = ^accompagni.~

	|116.  nulla~ = ^nessuna.  "Nulla" modifies "piet@a."

	|117.  a vergognar ti vien~ = ^vieni a vergognarti.~

	|118.  o sommo Giove~: Jove means Christ, as is made
evident by the following verse.

	|120.  li giusti occhi tuoi~: If God's justice now
Prevailed, the emperor would rule and order would be restored.
See ^Purg.~ XX, 94-96.

	|123.  l'accorger nostro scisso~: "Cut off," i.e.,
inaccessible to our understanding.

	|125.  tiranni~: See n. to ^Inf.~ XXVII, 38.  |Marcel~:
Marcellus, Roman consul and determined opponent of Julius Caesar.
There were three consuls named Marcellus who were opponents of
Caesar, viz., Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul 51 B.C., who was
pardoned by Caesar (46 ^B.C.~) on the intercession of the senate
(the subject of Cicero's ^Pro Marcello~), and was afterwards
murdered by one of his own attendants in Greece; Gaius Claudius
Marcellus, brother of Marcus, consul 49 B.C., when the civil war
broke out; and Gaius Claudius Marcellus, first cousin of the
preceding, consul 50 B.C.  However, it is certainly to the first,
Marcus Claudius Marcellus, that Dante refers.  He is the
"Marcellus loquax" of Lucan (^Phars.~ I, 313), who mentions him,
together with Cato and Pompey, as being among Caesar's bitterest
enemies.  Benvenuto says:

     Loquitur... de Marcello illo consule qui fuit audacissimus
     Pompeianus infestus semper Caesari, qui iudicavit ipsum
     hostem, ut patet apud Suetonium libro I; contra quem dicit
     Caesar, ut Lucanus scribit: ^Marcellusque loquax et nomina
     vana Catonis.~  Vult ergo poeta dicere tacite, quod sicut
     olim Marcellus ex magna affectione Praesumpsit et insurrexit
     contra Caesarem primum imperatorem, ita hodie omnis
     castellanus et villanus praesumit et insurgit contra
     imperatorem.

     He means... Marcellus, the consul, who as a devoted follower
     of Pompey was always opposed to Caesar, who considered him
     his enemy, as is clear from Book I of Suetonius.  Against
     whom, as Lucan has it, Caesar said: "talkative Marcellus and
     the empty titles of Cato."  The poet is here hinting that,
     just as Marcellus, out of his attachment [to Pompey],
     deliberately rebelled against Caesar, the first emperor, so
     today every owner of a castle and every villager would
     deliberately rebel against an emperor.

	|126.  parteggiando~: Organizing a faction (^parte~ in
Italian) or placing himself at the head of one.

	|127.  Fiorenza mia~: In ^Conv.~ IV, xxvii, II Dante
exclaims: "Oh misera, misera patria mia! quanta piet@a mi stringe
per te, qual volta leggo, qual volta scrivo cosa che a reggimento
civile abbia rispetto!" ("Oh, my wretched, wretched country!
What pity for thee constrains me whensoever I read, whensoever I
write, of aught that hath respect to civil government.")  The
whole "digression" here is bitterly ironical.  See ^Inf.~ XXVI,
1-12.

	|129.  si argomenta~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXII, 21.

	|130.  Molti~: "Many," i.e., in other cities.  |e tardi
scocca~: It is let fly (as an arrow) slowly.  "Arco" in the next
verse continues the metaphor.

	|133.  lo comune incarco~: Public office.

	|135.  sanza chiamare~: For the construction with the
infinitive, see ^Purg.~ V, 65.

	|136.  ti fa~ = ^fatti~, an imperative.

	|137.  tu ricca, tu con pace e tu con senno~: Porena
comments: "Il verso @e ironico, ma di due generi d'ironia.  ^Tu
con pace tu con senno~ dicono il contrario di ci@o che @e, ed
@e ironia di concetto.  Ma che Firenze fosse ricca, @e vero; onde
nel ^tu ricca~ l'ironia @e invece di sentimento."  ("The verse
is ironic, but contains two different kinds of irony.  `You at
peace, you wise' state the opposite of the truth and constitute
irony of conception.  But it was true that Florence was rich, so
that 'you rich' is irony of sentiment.")

	|138.  S'io dico 'l ver, l'effetto nol nasconde~: Porena
continues: "Si riferisce al ^tu con senno~, ch@e quanto segue @e
appunto una dimostrazione del quanto poco assennati sieno i
Fiorentini."  ("It refers to 'you with sense,' for what follows
is precisely a demonstration of how little sense the Florentines
had.")

	|139.  Atene e Lacedemona~: See F. Torraca (1912, p. 184,
n. 2), who quotes from the ^Institutiones~ of Justinian: "Origo
eius [iuris civilis] ab institutis duarum civitatium, Athenarum
scilicet et Lacaedemonis, fluxisse videtur."  ("It would appear
that the civil law takes its origin from the institutions of two
cities, Athens, that is, and Sparta.")  Lacedaemon, or Sparta,
was the capital of ancient Laconia and chief city of the
Peloponnesus.  The allusion is to the legislation of Lycurgus
there, and to that of Solon at Athens.  |fenno~ = ^fecero.~

	|141.  al viver bene~: The good, well-ordered life of the
citystate.

	|142.  verso di te~: "Compared to you."  |sottili~: In a
double sense of "clever" and "weak."

	|143-144.  ch'a mezzo novembre... fili~: The provision is
such that the laws which Florence spins in October do not last
till mid-November.  The choice of these two months, as I. Del
Lungo (1888, p. 159) suggests, may have been prompted by the fact
that the political changes which took place in Florence from
October to November of 1301 brought about the downfall of the
Bianchi and Dante's exile.

	|145.  rimembre~ = ^rimembri.~

	|147.  e rinovate membre~: And renewed your citizens,
i.e., by exiling them and then recalling them from exile.  For
^membre~ used for ^membri~, see E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 249.

	|149-151.  vedrai te somigliante... scherma~: Cf.
Augustine, ^Conf.~ VI, 16: "Vae animae meae audaci, quae
speravit, si a te recessisset, se aliquid melius habituram! versa
et reversa in tergum et in latera et in ventrem, et dura sunt
omnia, et tu solus requies."  ("Woe unto that audacious soul of
mine, which hoped that had she forsaken thee, she should have had
some better thing! Turned she hath, and turned again, upon back,
sides, and belly, yet found all places to be hard; and that thou
art her rest only.")
