	|1.  quell' ombre~: Belacqua and the other negligent.  

	|3.  ^di retro a me~: Where the souls sit in the shade of the
boulder.  |drizzando 'l dito~: Since Dante does not turn to look until
he hears the voice, presumably he then sees the soul still pointing its
finger at him and so, in afterknowledge, reports what strictly
speaking, he could not have seen at the moment.  For other examples of
this, see ^Purg.~ II, 39-42, and especially ^Purg.~ XI, 10-12.

	|4.  una grid@o~: This negligent soul gives evidence of
having somewhat more energy and curiosity, certainly, than
Belacqua seemed to have.  |Ve'~ = ^vedi.~  The soul speaks to one
companion only, not to the group.

	|4-5.  non par che luca... sotto~: As Dante climbs on up
the steep slope of the mountain, he is facing west -- and here in
this hemisphere the sun is to the north.  Therefore his shadow
falls to his left, as the souls now see.  When he first
approached them, having turned to the north (^Purg.~ IV, 101: "a
mancina") to proceed to where Belacqua sat, his shadow was
falling more or less directly behind him and was therefore less
noticeable.

	|6.  e come vivo par che si conduca~: The repetition of
"par" stresses the incredibility of what the spirit ^seems~ to
see.  One sign of the fact that Dante is alive would be his very
noticeable effort in climbing.

	|8.  vidile~ = ^le vidi.~  |guardar per maraviglia~: But one
can hardly imagine that lazy Belacqua is one of these, even now!

	|9.  pur me, pur me~: For the stress on persistence and
intensity which "pur" makes here, the more so by repetition, see
^Purg.~ VIII, 48.  |rotto~: Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 17, 88.

	|12.  che ti fa ci@o che quivi si pispiglia?~  The souls
are now talking among themselves about the discovery of Dante's
shadow.  "Pispiglia," however, is already leading to "lascia dir le
genti," in vs. 13, a moral injunction that would apply to Dante
in this life and as such may be compared with the moral
injunctions in ^Inf.~ XXIV, 46-51, and XXX, 145-48.

	|14-15.  sta come torre... venti~: For the background of
the metaphor, cf. Virgil, ^Aen.~ VII, 586, and X, 693-96 --
though there the figure is of a cliff rather than a tower.  

	|17-18.  da s$e dilunga il segno... insolla~: He puts the 
target (i.e., the attainment of the goal) ever farther from himself,
because the new thought weakens the force (the resolution) of the
first.

	|18.  insolla~: Cf. the adjective ^sollo~ in ^Inf.~ XVI,
28, and ^Purg.~ XXVII, 40.

	|20.  Dissilo~ = ^lo dissi.~

	|20-21.  del color... degno~: The blush of shame.

	|21.  talvolta~: Buti comments: "Et anco non sempre la
vergogna fa l'omo degno di perdono, che sono certi peccati che
richiedeno altro che vergogna."  ("Moreover, shame does not
always make a man worthy of forgiveness; for there are certain
sins that require more than shame.")

	|22-23.  per la costa... poco~: These souls, somewhat
higher up on the slope, are circling the mountain in what proves
to be the "proper" direction in Purgatory, i.e., to the right, or
counterclockwise for anyone facing the mountainside.  Their path
is crosswise to Dante's, and they are on his left, or to the
south of him, when they notice that he casts a shadow; for, as
noted, Dante's shadow falls on his left side as he climbs, facing
west, since the sun here is to the north.

	|24.  Miserere~: The fiftieth psalm, one of the seven
penitential psalms, which prays for forgiveness of sin and
for cleansing from sin.  See Ps. 50:3-5[51:1-3]: 

     Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam; et
     secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum dele iniquitatem meam.
     Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea, et a peccato meo munda me.
     Quoniam iniquitatem meam ego cognosco, et peccatum meum contra me
     est semper.

     Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; in the greatness
     of your compassion wipe out my offense.  Thoroughly wash me
     from my guilt and of my sin cleanse me.

     For I acknowledge my offense, and my sin is before me
     always.

Thus, in the words of this psalm, the souls pray that they may be
admitted to Purgatory (proper) above, where they are to cleanse
themselves of their "gravi offese," as vs. 72 has it.  ^a verso a
verso~: This probably means that two groups sing the verses
alternately.  Buti comments: "come cantano li chierici in coro"
("just as priests sing in choir").

	|27.  mutar~ = ^mutarono.~  |in un "oh!" lungo e roco~: The
^Anonimo fiorentino~ comments: "una voce roca, ci@o @e fioca et
spaventata" ("a hoarse voice, that is, a weak and frightened
voice").  The exclamation thus registers something of the same
wonder, touched with awe, that was evidenced by the pallor of the
first group encountered (^Purg.~ II, 69).

	|28.  messaggi~ = ^messaggeri.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XII, 78.  As
is then indicated (vs. 32), the two are chosen by the group as
messengers, hence "in forma di" ("delegated as").

	|29.  dimandarne~ = ^ci domandarono.~ 

	|30.  fatene~ = ^fateci.~  |saggi~: "Informed," "aware."

	|32.  mandaro~ = ^mandarono.~

	|34.  per veder~ = ^per aver veduto.~  |restaro~ = ^restarono.~

	|35.  assai~: Cf. the French ^assez~ and "assai" in
^Inf.~ XXIV, 72.

	|36.  f@accianli onore~ = ^gli facciano onore.~  Cf.
^Inf.~ IV, 93.  |ed esser pu@o lor caro~: "And it may profit
them," since Dante, when he returns to the world of the living,
can ask their dear ones to pray for their advancement here.

	|37-39.  Vapori accesi... agosto~: Grandgent explains
that "^vapori accesi~ comprise both meteors and lightning.
Meteors, cleaving the clear sky in the early night, and
lightning, cleaving the August clouds at sunset, move less
swiftly than the messengers."  "Vapori accesi" is understood as
the subject of the verb "fender"; "sereno" and "nuvole" are the
objects.

	|38.  di prima notte~: Early night is a time when we
commonly gaze at the stars.  |fender sereno~: Cleave the
heavens.  |sereno~: Clear sky.

	|39.  sol calando~: "Sol calando" is modeled on an
ablative absolute construction (Latin ^occidente sole~).

	|40.  che color non tornasser suso in meno~: The
comparison is in terms of the "s@i tosto" of vs. 37.  But, no
matter how swiftly the two messengers may run back up the slope,
and even though these are spirits, the hyperbole seems somewhat
extreme, to say the least.

	|41.  dier~ = ^diedero.~

	|42.  come schiera che scorre sanza freno~: The
comparison denotes a mounted troop that charges with loose rein.

	|43.  che preme a noi~: "That crowds towards us."

	|44.  vegnonti a pregar~ = ^vengono a pregarti.~

	|45.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |in andando~: Cf. the French ^en
allant.~

	|46.  che vai per esser lieta~: "Who go to be happy" in
Heaven.

	|47.  con quelle membra con le quai nascesti~: This
connects with "che vai," of the preceding verse, and does not
depend on "esser lieta."

	|48.  venian~ = ^venivano.~

	|49.  unqua~: Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 105: "unque."

	|50.  di l@a~: In the world of the living (cf. "tra '
vivi," vs.  103).  |novella~ = ^notizia.~

	|51.  deh, perch$e vai? deh, perch$e non t'arresti?~
Clearly Dante is following Virgil's bidding and continuing on up
the slope, listening as he goes (vs. 45).

	|52.  Noi fummo tutti~: Group movement, so characteristic
of Purgatory, is now matched by choral speech.  |gi@a~: The
adverb defies translation in this context.  It serves to
reinforce the absoluteness of the past tense of the verb "fummo,"
but also distributes the time referred to: "we were slain, each
in his time."  Without the "gi@a" there might somehow be the
suggestion that all were slain at one and the same time.  ^per
forza~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 34.  |morti~: ^Morire~ as a
transitive verb was common in early Italian.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII,
95.

	|53.  e peccatori infino a l'ultima ora~: Sinners to the
very end, even as were those of the other two groups in this
Antepurgatory; yet these, having been slain by violence, are
distinct, as yet another and third group.

	|54.  quivi~: In the last hour. |lume del ciel~: The
light of grace from Heaven.  |ne~ = ^ci.~

	|55.  pentendo~ = ^pentendoci.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII,
119.  |perdonando~: Cf. the Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6: 12), "et
dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus
nostris" ("and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors"), which is then repeated by Jesus (Matt. 6:14-15): "Si
enim dimiseritis hominibus peccata eorum, dimittet et vobis Pater
vester caelestis delicta vestra; si autem non dimiseritis
hominibus, nec Pater vester dimittet vobis peccata vestra."
("For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father
will also forgive you your offenses.  But if you do not forgive
men, neither will your Father forgive you your offenses.")  Cf.
also ^Purg.~ XV, 112-13.  |fora~ = ^fuori.~

	|56.  a Dio pacificati~: Reconciled with God.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XIII, 124: "Pace volli con Dio in su lo stremo."

	|57.  che del disio di s$e veder n'accora~: God gives to
these souls a longing to see Him, which saddens them ("accora")
because of the time they are obliged to wait in Purgatory, here
and also higher up, before that desire may be fulfilled, in
Heaven with Him.  Thus their condition here reflects that of the
Christian "pilgrim" who must live out his time on this earth,
even though he longs to be with God.  Cf. ^Purg.~ II, 12, "che
va col cuore e col corpo dimora," and see n. to ^Purg.~ II, 11-
12.  For "accora," cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 84; XV, 82. |n'~ = ^ne
(ci~).

	|58.  Perch$e... guati~: "Though I gaze."

	|60.  ben nati~: Born to good, since these souls will one
day see God (cf. ^Purg.~ III, 73); even as, by contrast, souls
in Hell were termed ^mal nati~ (see ^Inf.~ V, 7; XVIII, 76; XXX,
48).

	|61.  voi dite~: Imperative with emphatic subject
pronoun.  |per quella pace~: Dante swears by that which is most
dear to him, even as this first spirit to speak knows (vs. 65).
Dante too is seeking peace with God, through realm after realm of
the afterlife, guided by Virgil first through Hell, now through
Purgatory, at the summit of which he will attain to a first, if
imperfect, peace (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 115-17).

	|63.  cercar mi si face~: The peace, which is the goal,
is said to inspire the pilgrim with desire for itself, even as
God gives the souls a desire to see Him.  |face~ = ^fa.~

	|64.  E uno incominci@o~: This soul who speaks "before
the others" (vs. 67) is not named, but from the details of the
story he tells of his own violent death he can readily be
identified as Jacopo del Cassero, member of a noble family of
Fano, who was born ^ca.~ 1260.  He incurred the enmity of Azzo
VIII d'Este by his opposition to the designs of the latter upon
Bologna, of which city Jacopo was ^podest@a~ in 1296.  In revenge
Azzo had him assassinated at Oriago, between Venice and Padua,
while he was on his way (in 1298) to assume the office of
^podest@a~ at Milan at the invitation of Matteo Visconti.  He
appears to have gone by sea from Fano to Venice, and thence to
have proceeded toward Milan by way of Padua; but while he was
still among the lagoons, he was waylaid and stabbed.

	|66.  pur che 'l voler nonpossa non ricida~: "Provided
lack of power [inability on your part] does not thwart your
[good] will."  "Nonpossa" ("possa" here is a noun) is on the
model of such words as ^nonchalance~ and the scholastic ^non
posse~; cf. "nonpoder," ^Purg.~ VII, 57.  Benvenuto translates:
"dummodo impotentia non impediat voluntatem" ("so long as
impotence does not inhibit the will").  Dante has just said (vs.
60): "cosa ch'io possa."  |ricida~: Infinitive ^ricidere~, "to cut
off."

	|67.  Ond' io, che solo innanzi a li altri parlo~: This
spirit seems somewhat apologetic for venturing to speak thus
alone and for standing out in front of the rest of the group.
The touch serves to make the scene more concrete and vivid.

	|68-69.  quel paese... Carlo~: The March of Ancona (Marca
Anconitana), a former province of Italy situated between Romagna
and the kingdom of Naples.  It corresponds roughly to the
^compartimento~ now known as the Marches.

	|70-71.  di tuoi prieghi cortese in Fano~: Kind enough to
ask those who live in Fano and who love me to pray for me here.

	|71.  Fano~: Town of the March of Ancona, on the Adriatic
coast between Pesaro and Ancona, subject in Dante's time to the
Malatesta of Rimini.  |s@i che ben per me s'adori~: That good
prayers may be said for me, i.e., by persons living in grace.
Cf. "buon prieghi," ^Purg.~ III, 141.

	|72.  pur ch'i' possa purgar le gravi offesi~: The
"grievous sins" will be purged higher up, in Purgatory proper, to
which good prayers will hasten his admission.  

	|73-75.  Quindi fu' io; ma... Antenori~: Freely (to account for
"ma" here): I was born in Fano, ^but~ I did not die there; I met
violent death in another place.  Cf. vs. 134: "Siena mi f$e, disfecemi
Maremma."

	|74.  ond' usc@i 'l sangue in sul quale io sedea~:
Benvenuto comments: "Idest, vivebam, quia sanguis est sedes
animae."  ("That is to say, I lived; for the blood is the seat of
the soul.")  See Lev. 17: 14: "anima enim omnis carnis in
sanguine est" ("since the life of every living body is in its
blood").  The spirit speaks here as the soul, which was "seated
on its blood" when in the body.  See M. Barbi (1934b), pp.278-79,
and E. G. Parodi (1917), p. 31, n.2.

	|75.  fuoro~ = ^furono.~  |in grembo a li Antenori~: In the
territory of the Paduans.  The phrase suggests the great
treachery on the part of the Paduans, called Antenori for being,
according to the legend, the descendants of the Trojan Antenor,
who was said to have founded Padua and who in the Middle Ages was
believed to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks, whence a division
of Cocytus is named after him (^Inf.~ XXII, 88).  The name thus
makes a pointed allusion to the treacherous complicity of the
Paduans in the murder of Jacopo.

	|76.  l@a dov' io pi@u sicuro esser credea~: Benvenuto
comments: "quia inter Venetias et Paduam... ubi solet iter esse
tutissimum" ("because the route between Venice and Padua... was
normally quite safe").  Moreover, Jacopo had no reason to suspect
that there would be any complicity on their part.

	|77.  quel da Esti~: Azzo VIII d'Este, who in 1293
succeeded his father, Obizzo II, as marquis of Este.  See the
probable reference to him in ^Inf.~ XII, 112, and XVIII, 56,
where he is referred to as ^il marchese.~  |f$e~ = ^fece.~

	|78.  assai pi@u l@a che dritto non volea~: Far beyond
any rightful claim, i.e., far exceeding any good reason he might
have had for hating me.  According to the early commentators,
Jacopo had excited the animosity of Azzo not only by his
political opposition (see n. to vs. 64) but also by his personal
abuse of the marquis; thus Lana, commenting on vs. 70, says:

     Non li bastava costui fare de' fatti contra li amici del
     marchese, ma elli continuo usava villan@ie volgari contra di
     lui: ch'elli giacque con sua matrigna, e ch'elli era disceso
     d'una lavandara di panni, e ch'elli era cattivo e codardo; e
     mai la sua lingua non saziavasi di villaneggiare di lui.
     Per li quali fatti e detti l'odio crebbe s@i al marchese,
     ch'elli li tratt@o la morte in questo modo.

     He was not satisfied with doing things to hurt the friends
     of the marquis, but he would continually indulge in vulgar
     vilification of him, saying he had slept with his
     stepmother, that he was the son of a washerwoman, that he
     was evil and cowardly.  His tongue never tired of abusing
     him.  These words and deeds caused such great hatred in the
     marquis, that he had him killed in this way.

It should be recalled that Jacopo must have died ^forgiving~ the
marquis and his henchmen.  Thus here he speaks fairmindedly and
objectively, granting that "he of Este" had cause to hate him,
but not cause enough to justify his murdering him in this way.

	|79.  fosse~ = ^fossi.~  |la Mira~: Small town between Padua
and Venice on the banks of the Brenta canal.

	|80.  Oriaco~: Now Oriago, a village between Padua and
Venice, close to the lagoons.  The main highway leading from
Venice passed near Oriago and continued to La Mira.  The marquis'
henchmen did not "overtake" Jacopo at Oriago in the sense of
capturing him there, but only of surprising him there and
entering into pursuit of him as he then ran toward the swamp.

	|81.  ancor sarei di l@a dove si spira~: I.e., I should
still be among the living -- apparently implying that he would
have been helped by the townsfolk of La Mira, or would have found
some refuge or defense there, or might have escaped from his
assailants by continuing along the high road through La Mira.

	|82-84.  Corsi al palude.~..^laco~: Jacopo may well mean
that he was mounted and fleeing on horseback and that his horse
became entangled in the reeds and mud, so that he fell and was
overtaken and slain.

	|83.  impigliar~ = ^impigliarono.~

	|84.  laco~ = ^lago.~

	|85-86.  Deh, se quel disio... monte~: The familiar
formula of adjuration, appealing to that which is most dear to
the person spoken to (cf. ^Inf.~ X, 82; ^Purg.~ II, 16).  Dante
had sworn by his own desire for peace.  See nn. to vss. 61 and
63.

	|86.  tragge~ = ^trae.~  |a l'alto monte~: Here again (cf.
^Purg.~ II, 60; IV, 38) this phrase means the ascent to the
summit and to that goal to which Virgil leads, which is declared
to be peace (see ^Purg.~ XXVII, 115-17).

	|87.  con buona pietate aiuta il mio~: "With gracious
pity do you help my" desire for peace, i.e., by requesting the
living to pray for me, that I may enjoy a speedier entrance into
Purgatory proper.

	|88.  Io fui di Montefeltro, io son Bonconte~:
"Montefeltro" is here meant as part of a famous family name, not
as a statement of geographical origin.  There is thus some pride
of family in this first declaration, but it is relegated to the
past, by the verb in the past absolute; and there is a becoming
humility in the simple: "I ^am~ Bonconte."  Buonconte da
Montefeltro was the son of Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf.~ XXVII,
19-132) and like his father a leader of the Ghibelline party.  In
June 1287 he helped the Ghibellines to expel the Guelphs from
Arezzo, an event which was the beginning of the war between
Florence and Arezzo (Villani, VII, 115); in 1288 he helped
command the Aretines when they defeated the Sienese at Pieve del
Toppo (VII, 120); and in 1289 he was appointed captain of the
Aretines and led them against the Guelphs of Florence, by whom
they were totally defeated (June 11) at Campaldino, among the
slain being Buonconte himself (VII, 131), whose body, however,
was never discovered on the field of battle.

	|89.  Giovanna~: The widow of Buonconte.  |o altri~: Buonconte
was also survived by a daughter and a brother.

	|90.  con bassa fronte~: The soul hangs its head in
sadness, and perhaps in shame, at being quite forgotten among the
living.

	|91.  Qual forza o qual ventura~: The two terms, by
juxtaposition, suggest the meaning "what ^deliberate~ violence or
what ^blind~ chance."

	|92.  Campaldino~: Small plain in the Casentino, between
Poppi and Bibbiena, which was the scene of the battle, fought
June 11, 1289, in which Buonconte was slain.  See n. to vs. 88
and ^Inf.~ XXII, 4.

	|94.  Casentino~: District in Tuscany comprising the
upper valley of the Arno and the slopes of the Tuscan Apennines.
Cf. ^Inf.~ XXX, 65.

	|95.  Archiano~: Torrent which rises in the Apennines
above Camaldoli and, traversing the Casentino valley at its
"foot," falls into the Arno just above Bibbiena.

	|96.  l'Ermo~ = ^l'eremo.  "The Hermitage" is the monastery
of Camaldoli, perched high in the mountains above the Casentino
not far from the peak of Falterona, about thirty miles from
Florence, founded in the early eleventh century by Romuald for
his order of reformed Benedictines.  One branch of the Archiano
does in fact rise above the Hermitage, and Dante must have
considered this to be its main source.

	|97.  L@a 've 'l vocabol suo diventa vano~: When the
Archiano flows into the Arno, some two and a half miles from
Campaldino, its name "becomes useless" or "is lost."

	|99.  fuggendo a piede~: We must imagine him clad in
armor and thus fleeing on foot with great difficulty.  

	|100.  Quivi~: At the confluence of the Archiano and Arno.

	|103.  Io dir@o vero~: For this sort of pointer to some
remarkable or almost incredible thing which is about to be told,
see ^Inf.~ XVI, 124-30; XXV, 46-48; XXVIII, 112-18.  |e tu 'l
rid@i~ = ^e tu rid@illo.  "Rid@i" is an imperative.

	|104-105.  l'angel di Dio... gridava~: This is not the
incredible part of the scene as recounted by Buonconte, for it
was a common belief that angels and devils would come for the
soul at death and would struggle for possession of it, or, in the
case of a Franciscan, that St. Francis would come, instead of
the angel, as for Buonconte's father, Guido (^Inf.~ XXVII, 112-
23).  See Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sent. Petri Lombardi IV~ XX, i,
a. 1, q. 5, resp.:

     Credendum est enim, quod in egressu animae a corpore
     assistunt et spiritus bonus et spiritus malus, unus vel
     plures, et tunc secundum veritatem ferri sententiam; et si
     bona est, per ministerium boni Angeli vel adduci in caelum,
     vel in purgatorium, quousque, postquam purgata fuerit, per
     eius ministerium educatur...; si vero sit mala, per
     ministerium daemonum deduci ad infernum.

     For we must believe that when the soul leaves the body, the
     good and the evil spirits stand by, one or more, and then a
     true sentence is passed; if the soul is judged to be good,
     he is led away to Heaven in the company of a good angel, or
     else to Purgatory, from which, after he has been cleansed,
     he will be led out by the same escort...; if, however, the
     soul is judged to be evil, he will be led by the devil into
     Hell.

This belief had scriptural support; in his ^Sermones de Sanctis~,
Bonaventura (^De Sanctis Angelis~ V, ^collatio~, p. 630) cites
Apoc. 12:7: "factum est proelium magnum in caelo" ("there was a
battle in heaven"), commenting: "[Hoc proelium] fit quotidie in
morte cuiuslibet, quia nituntur daemones animas secum portare."
("This battle also takes Place daily, whenever a man dies,
because devils seek to carry off the souls.")  Bonaventura also
cites Luc. 16:22, explaining: "Daemones portaverunt divitem,
Angeli mendicum." ("Devils carried away the rich man, while an
angel bore off the soul of the beggar.")

	|106-107.  Tu te ne porti... lagrimetta~: The devil, by
his vehement protest, dramatizes the situation, seizing as he
does on the external and material "^little~ tear."  Tears would
of course accompany sincere repentance, as Manfred indicated
(^Purg.~ III, 119-20).  But true contrition for one's sins and
the pardoning of those who offend us is an essential part of the
final "conversion" by which the soul is reconciled with God -- as
perhaps the devil knows, but chooses not to acknowledge.
Preachers, legends, and miracle plays might also dramatize the
salvation of someone by "one little tear."  See Fra Giordano da
Rivalto, ^Prediche inedite~ IV: "E qu@i, cio@e in questo mondo,
solo una lagrima che vegna di buon cuore, di contrizione di suoi
peccati, @e di grande vertude; ch@e spegne e disf@a il peccato, e
quanti n'avessi, e sc@ampati dalle pene del ninferno, e merita
vita eterna."  ("Here, that is, in this world, a single tear from
a goodhearted person, contrite for his sins, is a thing of great
virtue.  It extinguishes and erases sins, be they ever so many,
it saves you from the pains of Hell, and it merits eternal
life.")

	|108.  l'altro~: The body.

	|109-110.  Ben sai come... riede~: Cf. Virgil, ^Georg.~ I,
322-24:

     saepe etiam immensum caelo venit agmen aquarum
     et foedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris
     collectae ex alto nubes...

     Often, too, there appears in the sky a mighty column of
     waters, and clouds mustered from on high roll up a murky
     tempest of black showers.

	|111.  tosto che sale dove 'l freddo il coglie~: Cf.
Dante, ^Conv.~ IV, xviii, 4: "Lo freddo @e generativo de
l'acqua."  ("It is cold that begets water.") 

	|112-113.  Giunse quel... 'ntelletto~: "Quel" (the devil), a
demonstrative pronoun here, is the subject of "giunse," and "mal voler"
is the object.  Angels, whether good or bad, have the faculties of will
and intellect.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^De malo~ q. 16, a. 1, ad 14: "In
Angelo aut daemone, si incorporei ponantur, non est alia potentia neque
operatio, nisi intellectus et voluntas."  ("In an angel or a devil,
considered as being incorporeal, there is no power or operation if not
the intellect and the will.")  The devil makes use of both faculties,
joining evil will, which seeks only evil, with intellect
(intelligence), to call up the storm and "make other disposal" (vs.
108) of the body.

	|113.  il fummo~: The "umido vapor" while it is still
mist and before it condenses to fall as rain.

	|114.  per la virt@u che sua natura diede~: It was
generally acknowledged that devils and angels had power over the
elements.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 112, a. 2,
resp.: "Sed et Angeli boni et mali possunt aliquid in istis
corporibus operari praeter actionem caelestium corporum,
condensando nubes in pluvias, et aliqua huiusmodi faciendo."
("Moreover both good and bad angels can work some effect in these
bodies independently of the heavenly bodies, by the condensation
of the clouds into rain, and by producing some such effects.")
See also Eph. 2:2, where the devil is termed ^princeps potestatis
aeris~ ("the prince of the power of the air").

	|115-123.  Indi la valle... ritenne~: For a description
of storms, see Virgil, ^Georg.~ I, 324-27 (continuing the passage
quoted in the n. to vss. 109-10):

     ... ruit arduus aether,
     et pluvia ingenti sata laeta boumque labores
     diluit; implentur fossae et cava flumina crescunt
     cum sonitu fervetque fretis spirantibus aequor.

     Down falls the lofty heaven, and with its deluge of rain
     washes away the gladsome crops and the labours of oxen.  The
     dykes fill, the deep-channelled rivers swell and roar, and
     the sea steams in its heaving friths.

	|115.  la valle~: The Casentino.  |come 'l d@i fu
spento~: The devil waits for night to fall, as he has more power
in the dark air.

	|116.  Pratomagno~: The mountain ridge which forms the
southwestern barrier of the Casentino.  |al gran giogo~: The main
ridge of the Apennines, forming the northeastern barrier of the
valley.

	|117.  intento~: Ready to pour forth its vapors as rain.
According to Dino Compagni's ^Cronica~ (I, 10), on the day of the
battle of Campaldino "l'aria era coperta di nuvoli."  ("The air
was covered with clouds.")

	|118.  si converse~ = ^si convert@i.~

	|119-120.  a' fossati venne... sofferse~: See Virgil's
"implentur fossae" quoted in the n. to vss. 115-23.

	|120.  ci@o che la terra non sofferse~: That part which
the ground could not absorb.

	|122.  lo fiume real~: The Arno.  Buti comments:
"Chiamano li Poeti fiumi reali quelli che fanno capo in mare,
come fa l'Arno; l'altri no."  ("The poets call 'royal rivers'
those that flow into the sea, like the Arno; not other rivers.")
But this was an established term for rivers that flow into the
sea and not merely one used by "poets."  See M. Barbi (1934b), p.
247.

	|123.  si ruin@o~: Cf. Virgil's "ruit" in the quotation
in the n. to vss. 115-23 and ^Inf.~ I, 61, "rovinava," where
many texts have "ruinava."

	|124-125.  Lo corpo mio gelato... sospinse~: "Corpo" is
the object of "trov@o," "l'Archian" the subject; the construction
continues with "quel" as the object and "Archiano" the subject of
"sospinse."  For "rubesto" ("raging"), see ^Inf.~ XXXI, 106.

	|127.  ch'i' fe'~ = ^che io feci.~  |'l dolor~: Physical pain
(which Buonconte knows will prove mortal) and also pain of
remorse, which brings him to fold his arms devoutly upon his
breast in the sign of the cross.

	|128.  volt@ommi~ = ^mi volt@o.~  The subject is still the
"Archiano," or the Arno, which it has now become.

	|129.  di sua preda~: The river's "spoil" is the debris
it carries with it, particularly at flood stage.

	|131.  e riposato de la lunga via~: Only when Dante has
rested from the long way will the third spirit have him take any
thought of her; and he is not asked to turn to others to request
that they pray for her, but only to "remember" her himself:
tenderness, compassion, and a sense of sad loneliness impress
these words of hers on every reader's mind and heart.

	|133.  ricorditi~: "Ricorditi" is here the impersonal
verb, in the subjunctive, with the pronoun in the dative.  Cf.
^Inf.~ XVIII, 73: "rimembriti."  |la Pia~: The use of the article
with a first name adds a touch of intimacy or familiarity, Pia
repeating in this way the ^la~ which other people used in
speaking ^of~ her, not ^to~ her.  Pia was a lady of Siena who,
according to some accounts, was the daughter of Buonincontro
Guastelloni and wife, first of Baldo di Ildobrandino de' Tolomei
(who died in 1290) and secondly of Nello or Paganello de'
Pannocchieschi of Castello della Pietra in the Sienese Maremma.
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ and Benvenuto, on the other hand, state
that she was herself a member of the Tolomei family and married
Nello, by whom she was put to death (in 1295); the mode of her
death is disputed, some saying that she was killed so secretly
that no one knew how it was done, while Benvenuto and others
relate that she was by Nello's orders thrown out of a window of
his castle in the Maremma:

     Ista anima fuit quaedam nobilis domina senensis de stirpe
     Ptolomaeorum, quae fuit uxor cuiusdam nobilis militis, qui
     vocatus est dominus Nellus de Panochischis de Petra, qui
     erat potens in maritima Senarum.  Accidit ergo, quod dum
     coenassent, et ista domina staret ad fenestram palatii in
     solatiis suis, quidam domicellus de mandato Nelli cepit
     istam dominam per pedes et praecipitavit eam per fenestram,
     quae continuo mortua est.  ...Ex cuius morte crudeli natum
     est magnum odium inter dictum dominum Nellum, et Ptolomaeos
     consortes ipsius dominae.

     This soul was a certain noble lady of Siena of the family of
     the Tolomei, and she was the wife of a distinguished
     soldier, called Lord Nello de' Pannocchieschi della Pietra,
     and he was powerful in the coastal area controlled by Siena.
     One day, while they were dining and she stood for a time at
     a window of the palace with her maid servants, a servant, at
     Nello's bidding, took her by the feet and threw her out of
     the window, and she died on striking the ground....  Because
     of this her cruel death there arose a great enmity between
     Nello and her family, the Tolomei.

According to C. Loria (1872, p. 413) a tradition, said to be
still current in the neighborhood, identifies the scene of the
murder with a spot known as the Salto della Contessa.  Nello's
motive for the crime is supposed to have been his desire to marry
the Countess Margherita degli Aldobrandeschi, widow of Guy de
Montfort.  Nello, who was captain of the Tuscan Guelphs in 1284,
and ^podest@a~ of Volterra (1277) and Lucca (1313), was still
living in 1322, in which year he made his will.  See B. Aquarone
(1889), pp. 79-84.

	The identification of La Pia with Pia the wife of Baldo
de' Tolomei has been disproved by L. Banchi, who shows from
documents discovered in the Sienese archives that the latter was
still alive, as the widow of Baldo, eighteen years after the
assumed date of Dante's journey through the afterlife.  See L.
Banchi (1883), p. 523:

     Questa Pia dei Comentatori era ancor viva nel 1318, vale a
     dire solo tre anni avanti la morte di Dante... @e certo che
     nel 18 mantenevasi vedova di Baldo Tolomei.  Senza dubbio
     ell'era gi@a molto innanzi con gli anni; e lo stesso Nello
     della Pietra che ne fu sin qui creduto il marito e il
     carnefice, nel 1318 toccava la settantina; erano ambedue per
     conseguenza non pi@u in et@a da amori, da gelosie, da
     romanzi.

     Questi ed altri argomenti proveranno che la vedova di Baldo
     Tolomei non fu la Pia che Dante cant@o.

See W. Mercer (1886) for the translation of Banchi's statement:

     This Pia of the commentators was still alive in 1318 -- that
     is to say just three years before the death of Dante... it
     is certain that in 1318 she continued widow of Baldo
     Tolomei.  Without doubt she was then well advanced in years;
     and the veritable Nello della Pietra, who was believed till
     now to be her husband and murderer, was close upon seventy
     years old in the year 1318.  They were both, therefore, past
     the age of love, jealousy, and romance.  These and other
     facts will demonstrate that the widow of Baldo Tolomei was
     not the Pia whom Dante celebrated.

Also see M. Barbi (1894); F. Maggini (1910), pp. 124-26; G.
Ciacci (1935), pp. 303-34.

	|134.  Siena mi f$e, disfecemi Maremma~: Cf. Virgil's
epitaph in the n. to ^Purg.~ III, 27: "Mantua me genuit, Calabri
rapuere."  |f$e~ = ^fece.~  |disfecemi~ = ^mi disfece.~

	|135.  salsi~ = ^se lo sa~, the so-called pleonastic
reflexive being (here, as usual) not pleonastic at all.  It
serves to reinforce the subject, bringing the verbal statement
back upon it, as though to say "he knows it ^well in his very own
conscience.~"

	|135-136.  che 'nnanellata pria... gemma~: Who had ringed
me in wedlock with his gem.  "Pria" defies translation.  F. Cipolla
(1894-95, p. 642) finds this to say about the elusive little
adverb in the present context: "Non indica un antecedente a
qualche cosa di determinato, che segua a quello: indica soltanto
l'inizio d'una serie, d'una condizione, che dopo dura."  ("It does
not indicate an antecedent of something determinate that follows
upon it; rather, it only indicates the beginning of a series, of
a condition that then perdures.")  And he also points to a kind
of equivalent in the "primus" of the opening verses of the
^Aeneid~:

     Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
     Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit
     litora...

which, to be sure, may be translated:

     Arms I sing and the man who first from the coasts of Troy,
     exiled by fate, came to Italy and Lavinian shores.

But "first," in such a context, gives quite the wrong meaning.
Cipolla has also pointed to the fact that Annibal Caro, in his
famous translation of Virgil's poem, rendered this "primus"
precisely with a ^pria.~

	Thus, the "pria" spoken by Pia points to the first act of
a whole sequence which led to her murder, but the term does not
imply a ^second~ specific event, but precisely the whole
sequence, which ended with her death.

	In the words "che 'nnanellata... m'avea con la sua gemma"
Pia refers to the common marriage custom of the day whereby, with
or without witnesses, it was enough for the man to place a ring
upon the woman's finger, and for the two to declare that they
took one another for husband and wife.  See M. Barbi (1934b), pp.
279-80.  The so-called ^nozze~, or public celebration of
marriage, with a banquet and merrymaking, then followed, after a
varying period of time, and took place in the house of the new
husband, whither the bride was led on this occasion, this
ceremony being commonly referred to as ^menare la donna.~  For
several excellent examples of the practice, see Boccaccio,
^Decam.~ II, 3, and V, 4 (vol. I, pp. 84-92, 367-72), and X, 8
(vol. II, pp. 275-91).  For a defense of another reading of the
verses, see G. Crocioni (1953).
