	|1.  S'io avessi le rime aspre e chiocce~: "Rime" here
does not mean "rhymes," even though many of the harsh and
clucking effects that the poet proceeds to create are indeed made
up of words that rhyme.  It means, rather, "verses" (hence, in
general usage, ^rimatore~ for poet and ^rime~ for poems).  For
another example of "chioccia," see ^Inf.~ VII, 2, where Pluto
with clucking words begins to speak mysteriously of Satan.

	|2.  buco~: The pit, or "pozzo" as it was termed when
first mentioned (^Inf.~ XVIII, 18).  Here the reference is to the
bottom of the pit, Cocytus, the frozen lake which constitutes the
ninth and last circle of Hell.

	|3.  pontan~: "Thrust in upon." ^tutte l'altre rocce~:
All the rocky cliffs of Hell, and indeed all the rocks of the
earth, since this is the very "bottom of the whole universe"
(vs. 8) and the center of gravity.

	|4.  premerei~ = ^spremerei.~  The verb retains the
material sense of "squeeze," as one might a lemon, in order to
extract all the "juice" ("suco").

	|concetto~: What the poet, having returned from his journey and
endeavoring now to recount in verse, remembers to have been his
experience.

	|5.  abbo~ (from Latin ^habeo) = ho.~  On this form,
found frequently in prose -- or out of rhyme -- see E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 257.

	|6.  tema~ = ^timore.~

	|dicer~: In this context the verb takes on the meaning of
"write verses."  Compare the phrases ^dir per rima, dicitore per rima.~

	|7-9.  ch$e non @e impresa...~^babbo~: As Rossi comments,
this is said with a light spirit of irony, just as we say, for
example, that a difficult and dangerous mountain pass cannot be
crossed with eyes closed."Pigliare a gabbo" and "che chiami mamma
o babbo" are examples of extreme litotes.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXXIII,
106-8.

	|7.  da pigliare a gabbo~: "To be taken in jest" or "to
be made light of."  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIII, 64-69.

	|8.  discriver fondo~: In early Italian the article is
frequently omitted, as it is here, but the omission is especially
expressive in this case, as if the poet were building the bottom
of Hell in describing it./   The bottom of Hell is near the center
of the earth, which in the Ptolemaic conception is the central
point of the whole material universe.  See Seneca, ^Hercules~
^furens~, vs. 831: "iusserat mundi penetrare fundum" ("had bidden
thee explore the world's foundations").

	|9.  n$e da lingua~ = ^n$e impresa da lingua.~

	|10.  Ma quelle donne aiutino il mio verso~: Dante's
appeal to the Muses ("quelle donne") for help in describing the
bottom of Hell amounts to a fresh invocation and marks, as it
were, a new beginning, serving to set off the ninth circle as a
new area, now entered upon.  See the poet's first such entreaty,
^Inf.~ II, 7.

	|donne~: From the Latin ^dominae.~

	|11.  Anfione a chiuder Tebe~: Amphion, son of Jupiter
and Antiope, with the help of the Muses built the walls of
Thebes; charmed by the magic skill with which he played the lyre,
the stones came down from Mount Cithaeron and placed themselves
of their own accord.  Horace refers to the story in the ^Ars
poetica~ (vss. 394-96):

     dictus et Amphion, Thebanae conditor urbis,
     saxa movere sono testudinis et prece blanda
     ducere quo vellet....

     ...hence too the fable that Amphion, builder of Thebes's
     citadel, moved stones by the sound of his lyre, and led them
     whither he would by his supplicating spell.

See Statius, ^Theb.~ X, 873-77.

	|12.  s@i che dal fatto il dir non sia diverso~: "So that
my words be not different from the reality that I saw."  See
^Inf.~ IV, 147.  il dir~: Cf. the word "dicer," vs. 6.

	|13.  mal creata~: See "mal nata" in ^Inf.~ V, 7; and
"mal nati" in ^Inf.~ XVIII, 76; XXX, 48.

	|plebe~: "Plebs." Morally and geographically, these are the
lowest of the low in Hell -- traitors, murderers, the worst sinners of
all.

	|14.  onde~ = ^del quale luogo.~

	|15.  mei~ = ^meglio~ (see ^Inf.~  X1V, 36).

	|qui~: On earth; the word is spoken from the point of view of
the poet, who has returned to earth.  See Matt. 26:24: "Bonum erat ei
si natus non fuisset homo ille."  ("It were better for that man if he
had not been born.")

	|pecore o zebe~: "Sheep or goats" do not have intellects
subject to perversion or immortal souls capable of sinning./  The
subject has shifted to the plural, to agree with the verb "foste."
|zebe~: Lana comments: "[Zebe] sono li capretti saltanti, e sono dette
^zebe~, perch@e vanno zebellando cio@e saltando."  ("^Zebe~ are jumping
goats.  And they are called ^zebe~ because they go about ^zebellando~,
that is, jumping.")

	|16.  nel pozzo scuro~: See the description of this
circle in ^Inf.~ IX, 28.

	|17-18.  sotto i pi@e del gigante...muro~: With these
verses the problem of where Antaeus and the other giants are
standing (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXI, 145) is brought into sharp focus.
The wayfarer is said to be looking up at the high wall, which
suggests that he and his guide are still more or less in the
place where Antaeus had set them down.  The giant is not
described as standing with his feet on the icy floor of Cocytus;
therefore, it makes sense that he and the others may be standing
on some sort of ledge high above that floor.  But are we to
conceive of Antaeus as being able to bend so far beneath his own
feet as to set Dante and Virgil down on the ice? The mystery
remains.  The wayfarer certainly would seem to be looking up at
the wall as if in wonder still at the surprising and frightening
means of descent provided him in his "fated journey" (^Inf.~ V,
22).

	|19.  dicere udi'mi~ = ^udii dirmi.~

	|19-21.  Guarda come passi...lassi~: Commentators are not
agreed as to who utters this plea.  Torraca believes that Virgil
utters it; others that some unnamed soul frozen in the ice does
so; and still others think that one or both of the two Alberti
(not identified until vs. 57) speak thus of "brothers," which
seems the most plausible interpretation.  Against the last
explanation is the argument that so many verses intervene before
the relationship between the two shades is revealed.  But this
scarcely refutes such a reading.  It may be argued that this gap
in the narrative simply creates suspense.

	|22.  vidimi davante~ = ^mi vidi davante.~

	|23.  un lago~: Cocytus, as it has been termed already
(in ^Inf.~ XIV, 119, where it was called a "stagno," or pond, and
in ^Inf.~ XXXI, 123).  The water originates from the crack in the
statue of the "veglio" (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 103) within Mount Ida in
Crete, and forms Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, all circular
bodies of still water, before it flows down to form this
bottommost pool.  See ^Inf.~ XIV, n. to vss. 121-38.  As the
subsequent cantos will show, Cocytus is divided into four
concentric areas, in which are punished four categories of
traitors.  We should probably imagine the ice as bloodcolored
(see ^Inf.~ XVI, 104), though nothing is made of this here.

	|25.  s@i grosso velo~: "So heavy a veil" or crust of
ice.

	|26.  la Danoia~: The Danube, which flows from southwest
Germany through central Europe to the Black Sea."Danoia"
corresponds to the German Donau.  In ^Par.~ VIII, 65, Dante uses
the more common form "Danubio."

	|Osterlicchi~: Austria.  See E. G. Parodi (1957), pp. 271-72,
who gives this and other forms that approximate the German Osterreich.

	|27.  Tanai~: The river Don (also called Tana by the
Italians in the Middle Ages; the classical Tanais), which rises
southeast of Tula, Russia, and flows first southeast and then
southwest, discharging into the Sea of Azov.  It was once
regarded as the boundary between Europe and Asia.  For example,
Orosius (^Hist.~ I, ii, 4) says of the Don: "Europa incipit ut
dixi sub plaga septentrionis, a flumine Tanai, qua Riphaei montes
Sarmatico aversi oceano Tanaim fluvium fundunt."  ("Europe
begins, as I have said, in the north at the Tanais River, where
the Riphaean Mountains, standing back from the Sarmatian Sea,
pour forth the Tanais flood.")

	|l@a sotto 'l freddo cielo~: In Russia, farther north and
therefore colder than Austria.

	|28.  Tambernicchi~: There is considerable uncertainty as
to which mountain is intended.  Many early commentators locate it
in Slavonia or thereabouts, while Buti claims it for Armenia.
More probably it is Mount Tambura in the Apuan Alps (see Torraca
and the review of A. Fiammazzo in G. Vandelli, 1932b).  Mount
Tambura is called "Stamberlicche" in certain early texts.  A
"Stambernicchi" is also to be noted in Luigi Pulci's ^Morgante~
XXIV, 88.  A point in favor of Mount Tambura is that it is in the
same mountain range as Pietrapana, mentioned in the following
verse as part of the same image.  On the identification of the
mountain, see B. Guyon (1903).

	|29.  Pietrapana~: Commonly identified with one of the
peaks, known as Pania della Croce, of the Apuan Alps, a group of
peaks in the northwest corner of Tuscany that lie west of the
valley of the Serchio and are loosely connected with the Apennine
range.  The Latin name, Petra Apuana, probably 585 derived from
the Apuani, a Ligurian tribe that formerly inhabited the
neighboring district.  Benvenuto says: "Est montanea altissima
omnium Tusciae, quae olim vocata est Petra Appuana, sicut saepe
patet apud Titum Livium, et est prope Petram sanctam non longe a
civitate lucana in confinibus Tusciae."  ("It is the highest
mountain in Tuscany and was once called Petra Apuana, as we know
from Titus Livy.  It is in the vicinity of Pietrasanta, not far
from the city of Lucca, on the borders of Tuscany.")  Landino
comments: "pietrapana @e in Toscana in Carfagnana sopra Lucca;
da' Latini @e detta Pietra Apuana."  ("Pietrapana is in Tuscany,
in the Garfagnana, above Lucca.  The Latins called it Petra
Apuana.")  E. Repetti (1833, p. 69, under the entry "Alpe Apuana,
Pania") understands Dante's reference to be to this group of
mountains.

	|30.  avria~ = ^avrebbe.~

	|pur da l'orlo~: The ice on ponds
usually thaws first near the edge and consequently is weakest
there.  For a special reason, which we learn later, it is colder
nearer the center of Cocytus, and the ice would be thicker there.

	|31-36.  E come a gracidar si sta la rana .~ ..^cicogna~:
See the description of the froglike positions of the barrators in
the fifth ^bolgia~, in ^Inf.~ XXII, 25-27.  The comparison here
is more terrible in that these "frogs" cannot move, but are
frozen in ice up to their necks.  Note, moreover, the contrast
between summer in the first term of this simile and deep winter
in the second.

	|32-33.  quando sogna...~^la villana~: The time of
gleaning in Italy is early summer.  The peasant woman is said to
dream of this work because gleaning is primarily woman's work
(one thinks of Ruth in the Bible) and because she stands to gain
from such labor.

	|34-35.  livide...ghiaccia~: The ice is transparent
enough for the submerged part of the shades to be visible (see
^Inf.~ XXXIV, 12).  Apparently the bodies are livid.  The verses
make the point that the shades are set in the ice up to where
shame appears -- i.e., up to their necks (like the frogs in
water) -- which must be above the ice, since the souls are able
to move their heads.

	|35.  ghiaccia~: Archaic for ^ghiaccio.~

	|36.  in nota di cicogna~: The clack of the stork's beak
is (one imagines) brittle, metallic, hard, and this suggested
sound adds markedly to the stylistic effect.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~
VI, 97: "ipsa sibi plaudat crepitante ciconia rostro" ("and claps
her rattling bill, a stork"), and Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~ I,
clx, I: "Cygoine est .i. oisiau sans lengue; et por ce dient les
genz que ele ne chante pas, mais bat son bec et fait grand
tumulte."  ("The stork is a bird without a tongue; and for this
reason people say that it does not sing, but clacks its beak and
makes a loud noise.")

	|37.  Ognuna in gu@i tenea volta la faccia~: The position
of these souls, "each [keeping] his face turned downward,"
distinguishes them from the souls immersed in the next area of
ice, whose heads are erect.  This downward-turned position of the
sinners' heads allows the tears to fall immediately from the
sinners' eyes (as vs. 46 suggests) instead of accumulating in the
eye sockets and freezing there.  Thus these souls are afforded
relief from pain at least to that extent.

	|38.  da bocca il freddo~: The cold is attested by the
chattering of the sinners' teeth.

	|e da li occhi il cor tristo~: The "sad [or sorry] heart" is
attested to by the tears in the sinners' eyes./  Thus "freddo" and "cor
tristo" each serve as subject of "si procaccia," of which
"testimonianza" is the object.

	|41.  volsimi~ = ^mi volsi.~

	|41-42.  due s@i stretti...misto~: The two, who prove to
be brothers (see vs. 58), face each other, their heads bent
forward and pressed so hard against each other that their hair is
mingled.

	|42.  avieno~ = ^avevano.~

	|44.  piegaro i colli~: In order to raise their heads as
much as possible, as the following verse makes clear.

	|46-47.  li occhi lor...le labbra~: As long as these
souls hold their heads bent downward, the tears do not freeze in
the eye sockets and hence up to this moment their eyes have been
wet only within, but now, as they raise their heads, the tears
overflow their eyes and run down to and over their lips.  Some
commentators would understand "le labbra" as metaphorical for
"the eyelids," and construe "su per" as meaning "up over" rather
than simply "over." But it seems best to take "labbra" in its
usual meaning of "lips" and bear in mind how tightly pressed
together the heads of the two are said to be.  One imagines them
with chins and mouths still touching, even after they have bent
back their heads as far as they can to see who the newcomers are.

	|47.  gocciar~ = ^gocciarono.~

	|47-51.  e 'l gelo strinse le lagrime tra essi...~^li
vinse~: Different interpretations of these verses have been
advanced.  If "labbra" is taken to mean "lips" (see n. to vss.
46-47), then it seems reasonable to understand that the attention
of the narrative here focuses on the lips, over which the tears
have run and have congealed.  The cold is thus said to bind the
tears "tra essi" ("between them") -- that is, between the two
brothers -- freezing them together in a grotesque icy "kiss"; and
since these brothers hated each other and slew each other (see n.
to vs. 57), their icy fate now stirs them to such rage that they
butt one another like two goats, each being capable of a forward
movement of the forehead.  This interpretation is adopted by
Sapegno, who gives credit to Casini.

	|48.  riserrolli~ = ^li riserr@o.~

	|49.  spranga~: An iron clamp."Spranga" here is the
subject of the verb.

	|50.  ei~ = ^essi.~

	|51.  cozzaro~ = ^cozzarono.

	|tanta ira li vinse~: The icelocked "kiss" stirs such rage in
them that they butt each other, ramming their foreheads together.

	|53.  pur col viso in gi@ue~: Keeping his face turned
down, this shade (named in vs. 68) avoided the awkward situation
of the other two and thus remained able to speak.

	|54.  in noi ti specchi~: In this case ^specchiarsi in~
probably implies nothing more than "to gaze on," as it is far
from clear how the wayfarer could be said to "mirror himself" in
any more literal sense.

	|55.  Se vuoi saper chi son cotesti due~: The pleasure
this soul takes in disclosing the names of his comrades is
evident.  Malice and treachery, "squealing" on one's companions
in misery, are notable characteristics of these vilest of
sinners.

	|56.  Bisenzo~: The Bisenzio River flows close to Prato
and Campi Bisenzio and falls into the Arno at Signa,
approximately ten miles west of Florence.  The Conti Alberti (see
n. to vs. 57) had castles in the Val di Bisenzio and the Val di
Sieve.

	|57.  del padre loro Alberto e di lor fue~: This, along
with the foregoing mention of the Bisenzio Valley (vs. 56), is
enough to identify the father as Alberto degli Alberti, count of
Mangona, and the two sons as Alessandro and Napoleone, who killed
each other in a dispute over their inheritance.

	Villani (VI, 68) states that the castle of Mangona
belonged by right to Alessandro, a Guelph and the younger of the
two brothers, and was unjustly seized by Napoleone, who was a
Ghibelline.  Villani does not mention the subsequent fatal
quarrel between the two brothers (which took place some time
after 1282 and before 1286).  Benvenuto, however, in his gloss on
vs. 54, says: "Venientes ad discordiam propter hereditatem, se
invicem interfecerunt."  ("As a result of disagreements over the
inheritance, they killed each other.")  On the feud between the
two Alberti, see M. Barbi (^~ 1899), pp. 204-5.

	|57.  fue~ = ^fu.~

	|58.  D'un corpo usciro~: They were born of the same
mother, i.e., were blood brothers, hence their crime is the more
terrible.

	|la Caina~: Caina, as we are soon to understand, is the first
subdivision of Cocytus, where those are punished who betrayed (and
murdered) their kinsmen -- and so it is well named after Cain, the
first such murderer./ The name of the place was uttered by Francesca in
^Inf.~ V, 107 as that which awaited her husband, Gianciotto, murderer
of her lover, Paolo (Gianciotto's brother), and of herself.

	|60.  fitta in gelatina~: It is difficult to judge the
semantic flavor of the phrase, but it seems ironical and derisive
(as it certainly would be in modern parlance).  See a similarly
ironic use of "broda" in ^Inf.~ VIII, 53 and of "la gelata" in
^Inf.~ XXXIlI, 91."Gelatina" could be construed as "cold
consomm$e" or the whole phrase simply, as Rossi suggests, as "set
in (or on) ice" or "placed in the cooler."

	|61-62.  quelli a cui fu rotto il petto...per la man
d'Art@u~: Mordred, the traitorous nephew (or son, according
to some versions) of King Arthur, whom he slew and by whom he was
slain.  The incident referred to by Dante is narrated in the romance
^La Morte d'Arthur.~  For the OFr manuscript version, see P. Toynbee
(1968), p. 68, under the entry "Art@u":

     Et Mordret, qui bien voit que li rois ne baiot s'a lui non
     ochire, nel refuse pas, ains li adrece la teste del ceval;
     et li rois, qui li vient al plus droit qu'il puet, le fiert
     de toute sa force si durement qu'il li ront les mailles del
     hauberc, et li met parmi le cors le fer de son glaive.  Si
     dist l'estoire qu'apres l'estors del glaive passa parmi la
     plaie uns rais de soleil si apertement que Girflet le vit.
     Dont cil del pais distrent que ce avoit fait Nostre Sires
     par coros qu'il avoit a lui.

     And Mordred, who clearly saw the king glaring at him with
     murder in his eye, did not hesitate, but straightened his
     horse's head; and the king, who came at him as directly as
     he could, struck him with all his strength so hard that he
     broke the chain mail of his hauberk and split his body
     with the steel of his sword.  The story recounts that after
     the sword thrust, a ray of sunlight passed through the wound
     so visibly that Girflet saw it.  Whence the people of the
     region said that Our Lord did this because of the anger He
     bore him.

	|62.  esso~ (Latin ^ipse~): With one and the selfsame
blow.  Cf. "sovresso," ^Inf.~ XIII, 54.

	|63.  Focaccia~: Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed
Focaccia, of Pistoia, was guilty of murdering (October 1293), not
his uncle, as many early commentators have it, but a cousin, one
Detto di Sinibaldo Cancellieri.  M. Barbi (1934b, pp.  299-300)
calls attention to the following passage from the ^Storie
pistoresi~ III:

     Uno d@i venendo messer Detto alla ditta piazza e
     entrando in una bottega d'uno che li facea uno farsetto
     di zendado presso a casa de' figliuoli di messer Ranieri, lo
     Focaccia e Freduccio con certa quantit@a di fanti
     entrarono nella ditta bottega e quivi l'uccisono, e
     partironsi....

     One day, Messer Detto came to that square and went into the
     shop of someone who was making a sendal doublet for him.
     The shop was near the house of the sons of Messer Ranieri.
     Focaccia and Freduccio, with a number of others, entered the
     shop, killed him, and then fled.

	|65.  Sassol~: Pronounced ^Sass@ol.~

	|Sassol Mascheroni~:  A Florentine, said by the commentators to
have belonged to the Toschi family, who murdered a kinsman (variously
recorded as brother, nephew, uncle, or cousin), for the sake of his
inheritance.  On the discovery of the crime, he was rolled through the
streets of Florence in a cask full of nails and afterward beheaded.
According to the ^Anonimo fiorentino~: "Fu questa novella s@i palese,
che per tutta Toscana se ne parl@o: et per@o dice l'Auttore: Se tu se'
di Toscana, tu il dei sapere." ("This story was so well known that all
Tuscany spoke of it.  And that is why the author says: 'If you are from
Tuscany, you must know about it.' ")

	|67.  metti~ = ^metta.~

	|68.  il Camiscion de' Pazzi~: Alberto (or Uberto)
Camicione de' Pazzi of Val d'Arno, of whom nothing is known
except that he treacherously killed his kinsman Ubertino.  The
^Anonimo fiorentino~ gives as the motive for the deed the fact
that Camicione desired certain fortresses which he and Ubertino
held in common.

	|69.  Carlin~: Carlino de' Pazzi of Val d'Arno, who,
while the Neri of Florence and the Lucchese were besieging
Pistoia in 1302, held the castle of Piantravigne in the Val
d'Arno for the Bianchi of Florence, but for a bribe betrayed it
into the hands of the Neri.  Villani (VIII, 53) gives the
following account:

     Nella stanza del detto assedio di Pistoia si rubell@o a'
     fiorentini il castello di Piantrevigne in Valdarno, per
     Carlino de' Pazzi di Valdarno, e in quello col detto Carlino
     si rinchiusono de' migliori nuovi usciti bianchi e
     ghibellini di Firenze grandi e popolani, e faceano grande
     guerra nel Valdarno: la qual cosa fu cagione di levarsi
     l'oste da Pistoia, lasciando i fiorentini il terzo della
     loro gente all'assedio di Serravalle in servigio de'
     Lucchesi, come detto avemo, e tutta l'altra oste tornata in
     Firenze, sanza soggiorno n'andarono del mese di Giugno in
     Valdarno e al detto castello di Piano, e a quello stettono e
     assediarono per ventinove d@i.  Alla fine per tradimento del
     sopraddetto Carlino, e per moneta che n'ebbe, i Fiorentini
     ebbono il castello.  Essendo il detto Carlino di fuori, fece
     a' suoi fedeli dare l'entrata del castello, onde molti vi
     furono morti e presi pure de' migliori usciti di Firenze.

     When the siege of Pistoia was going on, Carlino de' Pazzi of
     Val d'Arno caused the castle of Piantravigne in Val d'Arno
     to rebel against the Florentines.  Carlino and some of the
     best of the recent Ghibelline and White exiles of Florence
     -- both noblemen and commoners -- shut themselves in the
     castle and waged a great war in thee Val d'Arno.  On account
     of this, the Florentines had to remove their army from
     Pistoia.  Leaving a third of their men in the service of the
     Lucchese at the siege of Serravalle, as we have said, the
     rest of the army was returned to Florence; and then, without
     resting, they went to the Val d'Arno, in the month of June,
     to that castle of Piano.  They besieged it for twenty-nine
     days.  Finally, through the treachery of Carlino, who
     received a bribe, the Florentines took the castle.  While
     Carlino was outside, he had some of his trusted men give the
     Florentines access to the castle.  Many of the best
     Florentine exiles were captured or killed.

Dino Compagni says in his ^Cronica~ (II, 28):

     A Parte bianca e ghibellina accorsono molte orribili
     disaventure.  Egli aveano in Valdarno un castello in Pian di
     Sco, nel quale era Carlino de' Pazi con LX cavalli e pedoni
     assai.  I Neri di Firenze vi p@ossono l'assedio.  Dissesi
     che Carlino li trad@i per danari ebbe: il perch@e i Neri vi
     misono le masnade loro, e presono gli uomini, e parte
     n'uccisono, e il resto feciono ricomperare.

     The White and Ghibelline faction suffered many horrible
     misfortunes.  They had a castle in the Val d'Arno, at Pian
     di Sco; inside it, there was Carlino de' Pazzi, with sixty
     knights and many infantrymen.  The Blacks of Florence
     besieged the castle.  Carlino was said to have betrayed it
     for money.  The Blacks threw in their soldiers and captured
     the men.  Some they killed, others they held for ransom.

On the payment of the bribe to Carlino and others involved, see
R. Davidsohn (1912), pp. 227-28.

	When Carlino dies, he will go to the next or second ring
of Cocytus for this crime against his party, which is so much
worse than Camicione's crime that Camicione expects it to make
his own deed seem less heinous by comparison.  Since at the time
of the poem Carlino's crime has not yet been committed,
Camicione's statement exemplifies the ability of souls in Hell to
"prophesy" future events (see ^Inf.~ X, 100-102).

	|70-72.  Poscia vid' io...~^guazzi~: The transition to
the second subdivision of the ninth circle of Hell is here very
subtly suggested, by the sight now of the many faces in a new
position (erect, else the poet could not so readily describe
their color) and by the use of the word "guazzi" ("fords"), which
serves to signal a crossing over from one area to another.

	|70.  cagnazzi~: "Purple" from the cold, a deeper color
than the "livide" of vs. 34.  That "cagnazzi" here denotes a
color and not "doglike" is argued by F. Maggini (1920,
pp. 142-43), with a persuasive example from Franco Sacchetti.

	|71.  riprezzo~ = ^ribrezzo.~

	|72.  guazzi~ = ^guadi.~  See ^Inf.~ XII, 139.

	|73.  in ver'~ = ^in verso.~

	|73-74.  lo mezzo al quale ogne gravezza si rauna~: The
"bottom of the whole universe" (vs. 8) is, in the Ptolemaic
system, just such a place where all gravity converges.  See
^Inf.~ XXXIV, 111.

	|74.  rauna~ = ^raduna.~

	|76.  se voler fu~: Some commentators interpret "voler"
to refer to the wayfarer's will and understand that now, out of
cold indifference, he does not remember or is uncertain that he
kicked a shade in the face.  Surely "voler" here refers to
Another's will, the Divine Will, which often "increases the
vengeance" (vs. 8o; also see ^Inf.~ IX, 94-96).  On the
relationship between destiny and will, see ^Inf.~ IX, 97.

	|78.  nel viso ad una~: This shade proves to be Bocca
degli Abati (named in vs. 106), who, while ostensibly fighting on
the side of the Florentine Guelphs at the battle of Montaperti,
at the moment when the latter were hard pressed by Manfred's
German cavalry, treacherously cut off the hand of the Florentine
standard-bearer, thus creating a panic, which ended in the
disastrous defeat of the Guelphs.  On the identity of Bocca, see
A. Della Torre (1905), pp. 171-72, n. 4.

	|79.  peste~ = ^pesti.~

	|80.  a crescer~ = ^ad accrescere.~

	|vendetta~: The punishment, for his crime at Montaperti (see n.
to vs. 78).  Compare ^Inf.~ VIII, 52-60, where the wayfarer, acting
with ^bona ira~, caused the punishment of Filippo Argenti to be
increased, wishing to see him ducked in the Styx.

	|81.  Montaperti~: Monaperti is a village in Tuscany, a
few miles east of Siena, on a hill near the Arbia.  The famous
battle between the Ghibellines of Siena and Florence and the
Florentine Guelphs took place at Montaperti on September 4, 1260,
resulting in the total defeat of the Guelphs, to which Dante
refers in ^Inf.~ X, 85-86 as "the havoc and great slaughter that
dyed the Arbia red."

	|moleste~ = ^molesti.~

	|84.  quantunque vorrai~ = ^quanto ti piacer@a.~  See
^Inf.~ V, 12.

	|87.  altrui~: This indefinite pronoun used for a
definite pronoun is the direct object of the verb.  See similar
cases in ^Inf.~ VIII, 87; XXVII, 56; and vs. 89 of the present
canto.

	|88.  Antenora~: The name of the second of the four
subdivisions of the ninth circle of Hell, in which are punished
those who betrayed their country or their party -- political
traitors -- is derived from the Trojan Antenor, who in the Middle
Ages was believed to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks.  In the
twelfth-century ^Roman de Troie~ of Beno#it de Sainte-Maure, for
example, he is spoken of in vs. 26135 as "Antenor, li coilverz
Judas" ("Antenor, the treacherous Judas") and in vs. 25842 as "li
vieuz Judas" ("the old Judas").  Among other acts of treachery,
Antenor was thought to have been involved with the theft of the
Trojan Palladium (mentioned by Dante in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 63) and the
stratagem of the Trojan horse -- Aeneas, in some versions, being
implicated in these betrayals.  The medieval belief was no doubt
derived from the histories of Dictys Cretensis and Dares
Phrygius, which, through the medium of Latin versions, were
widely read in the Middle Ages (see ^Ephemeris belli Troiani~ V,
4-17 and ^De excidio Troiae~ XXXIX-XLIV).

	The Homeric account (^Iliad~ III, 146-60; VII, 345-53),
that Antenor tried to save his country by advising the surrender
of Helen, was apparently lost sight of at the time.  There is no
hint of his treachery in Virgil, but Servius (who lived in the
late fourth and early fifth centuries) makes mention of it in his
note on ^Aen.~ I, 242, and refers for confirmation to Livy (I, i,
1): "Iam primum omnium satis constat Troia capta in ceteros
saevitum esse Troianos: duobus, Aeneae Antenorique, et vetusti
iure hospitii et quia pacis reddendaeque Helenae semper auctores
fuerunt, omne ius belli Achivos abstinuisse."  ("First of all,
then, it is generally agreed that when Troy was taken vengeance
was wreaked upon the other Trojans, but that two, Aeneas and
Antenor, were spared all the penalties of war by the Achivi,
owing to long-standing claims of hospitality, and because they
had always advocated peace and the giving back of Helen.")

	|89.  altrui~: Dative, referring to "gote" and echoing
the "altrui" of the question in vs. 87.

	|90.  se fossi vivo, troppo fora~: Since the subject of
"fossi" is either ^tu~ or ^io~ (understood), one of two
interpretations is possible: if ^you~ were alive, it would be too
hard a kick for a living foot to give; or, if ^I~ were alive, it
would be too much to bear and already I would have made you pay
for it.  The first meaning seems preferable.  The reply in the
next verse, echoing the "vivo," makes sense in either case.

	|93.  tra l'altre note~: In the book of my memory where
this journey is recorded.

	|94.  Del contrario~: What Bocca most desires is ^not~ to
be remembered on earth.

	|95.  quinci~ = ^di qui.~

	|lagna~: "Annoyance," "cause for complaint."

	|96.  lama~: See ^Inf.~ XX, 79, where the term refers to
the lowlying swamp on which Mantua was built.  Here it indicates
the pond of Cocytus, the lowest place of all.

	|97.  cuticagna~: Scalp at the nape of the neck or the
hair of the nape, as in vs. 103.  Bocca, to hide his face, bends
his head down and refuses to raise it.

	|100.  Perch$e~ = ^per quanto.~

	|101.  n$e mosterrolti~ = ^n$e te lo mostrer@o~, i.e., by
raising my head and showing my face.  The soul does not know that
Dante would not recognize him in any case (the battle of
Montaperti took place five years before the poet's birth)./
^Mosterr@o~ is very common as a form of the future tense in early
Italian.

	|102.  tomi:~ ^Tomare = cadere.~  See ^Inf.~ XVI, 63.  The
meaning here is "to fall upon" or "to jump on."

	|105.  latrando lui~: A construction on the model of an
ablative absolute.

	|raccolti~: "Turned down fixedly." Porena believes that the
looking down fixedly is a concentration of effort on Bocca's part, so
that he will not be overcome by pain and give in.

	|106.  Bocca~: This name, together with the mention of
Montaperti (vs. 81), is quite enough to suggest to the wayfarer
who this traitor may be.

	|109.  vo'~ = ^voglio.~

	|favelle~ = ^favelli.~

	|110.  a la tua onta~: The phrase can mean either "in
spite of you" or "to your shame."  In this context, it might well
have both meanings.

	|113.~  se tu di qua entro eschi~: This can
hardly be the formula of adjuration, even though "eschi" might
stand for the subjunctive ^esca~ here, a possible colloquialism.
The phrase seems rather to contain a thrust, suggesting a certain
doubt that the wayfarer will ever get out of Hell.

	|114.  la lingua pronta~: "Quick to speak."

	|115.  piange~: "Pays the penalty for."

	|argento~: Given the context, perhaps this is intended as a
Gallicism, echoing the French ^argent~, but not necessarily (see, for
example, ^Par.~ XVII, 84).

	|Franceschi~ = ^Francesi.~  See ^Inf.~ XXVII, 44.

	|116.  quel da Duera~: Buoso da Duera was a Ghibelline
leader of Cremona.  When the army of Charles of Anjou entered
Italy in 1265, on its way to encounter Manfred and take
possession of the kingdom of Naples, the French troops were able
to advance through Lombardy and make their way into Parma
unmolested, although Manfred had ordered the force of Cremonese
and other Ghibellines of Lombardy to block their passage.  This
neglect of Manfred's instructions was due to some act of
treachery, not clearly specified, on the part of the Cremonese
leader Buoso da Duera, who was believed to have been bribed by
the French -- by Charles' wife, according to Benvenuto: "Uxor
Caroli veniens cum Guidone de Monforte portabat secum magnam
pecuniam, cum qua venenavit avaram mentem Bosii."  ("The wife of
Charles, who came with Guy de Montfort, brought a great deal of
money with her, which she used to corrupt the greedy mind of
Buoso.")  Villani is less specific (VII, 4):

     Il conte Guido di Monforte colla cavalleria che'l conte
     Carlo gli lasci@o a guidare, e colla contessa moglie del
     detto Carlo, e co' suoi cavalieri, si partirono di Francia
     del mese di Giugno del detto anno....E coll'aiuto de'
     Milanesi, si misono a passare la Lombardia tutti in arme, e
     cavalcando schierati, e con molto affanno di Piemonte infino
     a Parma, perocch@e 'l marchese Pallavicino parente di
     Manfredi, colla forza de' Chermonesi e dell'altre citt@a
     ghibelline di Lombardia ch'erano in lega con Manfredi, era a
     guardare i passi con pi@u di tremila cavalieri, che Tedeschi
     e che Lombardi; alla fine, come piacque a Dio...i Franceschi
     passarono sanza contasto di banaglia, e arrivarono alla
     citt@a di Parma Bene si disse che uno messer Buoso della
     casa di que' da Duera di Chermona, per danari ch'ebbe dai
     Franceschi, mise consiglio per modo, che l'oste di Manfredi
     non fosse al contasto al passo, com'erano ordinati, onde poi
     il popolo di Chermona a furore distrussono il detto
     legnaggio di quegli da Duera.

     In the month of June of that same year [1265], Count Guy de
     Montfort left France with the cavalry put under his charge
     by Count Charles.  With him went Charles' wife, the
     countess, and his knights....With the help) of the Milanese,
     they passed through Lombardy, completely armed and riding in
     formation.  They had great difficulty from Piedmont all the
     way to Parma, for the Marquis Pallavicino, a relative of
     Manfred, was guarding the passes with more than three
     thousand knights, some Germans, some Lombards, and with the
     help of Cremona and the other Ghibelline cities in Lombardy
     allied with Manfred.  Finally, it pleased God...to have the
     French pass through without a contest of arms, and they
     arrived in the city of Parma.  It was rightly said that a
     certain Messer Buoso, of the house of the Duera of Cremona,
     having received a bribe from the French, arranged things in
     such a way that Manfred's army did not contest the pass, as
     it had been ordered to do.  For this reason, the infuriated
     people of Cremona later destroyed the line of the Duera.

	|117.  l@a dove i peccatori stanno freschi~: This might
well be the origin of the modern idiomatic expression ^stare
fresco~, "to be in a pickle."  In any case it seems extremely
ironical, given the context, and in tone resembles the phrase
"esser fitta in gelatina" of vs. 60.

	|118.  Se fossi domandato "Altri chi v'era?~" Bocca's
purely gratuitous malice continues.

	|119.  quel di Beccheria~: Tesauro de' Beccheria of
Pavia, abbot of Vallombrosa and legate in Tuscany of Alexander
IV.  After the expulsion of the Ghibellines from Florence in
1258, he was seized by the Florentines on a charge of intriguing
with the Ghibellines, and beheaded in the same year.  Benvenuto
points out that Tesauro was a Florentine not by birth but by
adoption: "Poterat dici florentinus, ratione incolatus, quia
erat ibi beneficiatus."  ("He could be called a Florentine,
since, as a resident, he enjoyed its privileges.")

	|120.  gorgiera~: "Gorget," the piece of armor that
defended the throat.  Porena suspects this is a Lombardism, used
by Bocca as a way of alluding to the fact that Tesauro was a
Lombard.

	|121.  Gianni de' Soldanier~: A Florentine Ghibelline.
After the defeat and death of Manfred at Benevento in 1266 the
Florentine commons rose against the government of Guido Novello
and the Ghibelline nobles.  On this occasion Gianni de'
Soldanieri, though a Ghibelline, placed himself at the head of
the populace in opposition to his own party, his motive being,
according to Villani (VII, 14), his own aggrandizement:

     Il popolo si ridusse tutto nella via larga di santa Trinita,
     e messer Gianni de' Soldanieri si fece capo del popolo per
     montare in istato, non guardando al fine, che dovea riuscire
     a sconcio di parte ghibellina, e suo dammaggio, che sempre
     pare sia avvenuto in Firenze a chi s'@e fatto capo di
     popolo.

     The people all gathered in the broad street of Santa
     Trinita, and Messer Gianni de' Soldanieri became their head,
     in an attempt to get power, not thinking of the outcome,
     which was to be so ruinous to the Ghibelline cause, nor the
     harm to himself, which, it seems, always befalls those in
     Florence who become heads of the people.

Elsewhere, however, Villani mentions Gianni among those who had
done good service to the state and had been treated with
ingratitude (XII, 44).

	|122.  Ganellone~: Ganelon, the traitor who brought about
the destruction of Charlemagne's rear guard at Roncesvalles,
where Roland, Oliver, and the rest of the twelve peers were
slain.  His name, like that of Antenor, became a byword for
treachery in the Middle Ages.  See ^Inf.~ XXXI, 16-18 and notes
to ^Inf.~ XXXI, 17, 18.

	|122-123.  Tebaldello...si dormia~: Tebaldello, called by
some chroniclers and commentators Tribaldello, was a member of
the Ghibelline Zambrasi family of Faenza.  In order to avenge a
private grudge against some of the Lambertazzi (the Ghibellines
of Bologna), who after their expulsion from Bologna had taken
refuge in Faenza, he treacherously opened the gates of that city
in the early morning of November 13, 1280, to their Guelph
opponents, the Geremei of Bologna.  Villani (VII, 81) states that
Tebaldello was killed in 1282 during the assault on Forl@i, which
was repulsed by Guido da Montefeltro.  This is the battle
referred to in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 43-44.

	|124.  da ello~ = ^da lui~, i.e., Bocca degli Abati.  See
"con elle," ^Inf.~ III, 27.

	|125.  ch'io~ = ^quand'io.~

	|127.  si manduca~ = ^si mangia.~

	|128.  pose~: Dante sometimes in rhyme uses a past
absolute tense which cannot be understood in the usual sense.
The soul did not sink its teeth into the other at just that
moment, as such a narrative tense might suggest, but had already
done so, and long since.

	|129.  l@a 've 'l cervel s'aggiugne con la nuca~: B.
Nardi (1944, pp. 249-57) has shown that ^nuca~, in Dante's time,
had the precise meaning of "spinal marrow," which was held by
some to be part of the brain.

	|s'aggiugne~ = ^si congiunge.~

	|130-131.  non altrimenti Tideo...Senalippo per disdegno~:
Tydeus, king of Calydon, was one of the seven kings who joined
Adrastus, king of Argos, in the expedition against Thebes (see
^Inf.~ XIV, 68-69 and n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 69).  In this war Tydeus
was mortally wounded by the Theban, Menalippus (or Melanippus),
whom, however, he managed to slay in turn.  According to Statius,
Tydeus, in a fury of madness, seized on the head of Menalippus,
and, fixing his teeth in it, gnawed through the skull and ate
part of the brain.  See Statius' account (^Theb.~ VIII, 739-62):

     "...caput, o caput, o mihi si quis
     adportet, Melanippe, tuum! nam volveris arvis,
     fido equidem, nec me virtus suprema fefellit.
     i, precor, Atrei si quid tibi sanguinis umquam,
     Hippomedon, vade, o primis puer inclyte bellis
     Arcas, et Argolicae Capaneu iam maxime turmae."

     Moti omnes, sed primus abit primusque repertum
     Astaciden medio Capaneus e pulvere tollit
     spirantem laevaque super cervice reportat,
     terga cruentantem concussi vulneris unda:
     qualis ab Arcadio rediit Tirynthius antro
     captivumque suem clamantibus intulit Argis.

     Erigitur Tydeus voltuque occurrit et amens
     laetitiaque iraque, ut singultantia vidit
     ora trahique oculos seseque adgnovit in illo,
     imperat abscisum porgi, laevaque receptum
     spectat atrox hostile caput, gliscitque tepentis
     lumina torva videns et adhuc dubitantia figi.
     infelix contentus erat: plus exigit ultrix
     Tisiphone; iamque inflexo Tritonia patre
     venerat et misero decus immortale ferebat,
     atque illum effracti perfusum tabe cerebri
     aspicit et vivo scelerantem sanguine fauces --
     nec comites auferre valent...

     "Thy head, thy head, O Melanippus, could one but bring me
     that! for thou art grovelling on the plain, so indeed I
     trust, nor did my valour fail me at the last.  Go,
     Hippomedon, I beg, if thou hast aught of Atreus' blood, go
     thou, Arcadian, youth renowned in thy first wars, and thou,
     O Capaneus, mightiest now of all the Argive host!"

     All were moved, but Capaneus first darts away, and finding
     the son of Astacus lifts him still breathing from the dust,
     and returns with him on his left shoulder, staining his back
     with blood from the stricken wound: in such wise did the
     Tirynthian return from the Arcadian lair, when he brought
     home to applauding Argos the captive boar.

     Tydeus raises himself and turns his gaze upon him, then mad
     with joy and anger, when he saw them drag the gasping
     visage, and saw his handiwork therein, he bids them cut off
     and hand to him his foe's fierce head, and seizing it in his
     left hand he gazes at it, and glows to see it still warm in
     life and the wrathful eyes still flickering ere they closed.
     Content was the wretched man, but avenging Tisiphone demands
     yet more.  And now, her sire appeased, had Tritonia come,
     and was bringing immortal lustre to the unhappy hero: when
     lo! she sees him befouled with the shattered brains'
     corruption and his jaws polluted with living blood -- nor
     can his comrades wrest it from him....

	|130.  si rose~: The "si" (which is untranslatable) adds
a special touch.  Cf. the English "I'm going to have me a good
meal."  See also the "ti" in vs. 134.

	|131.  le tempie~: Used here for the skull (see "teschio"
in the next verse).  Cf."caput" in ^Theb.~ VIII, 739, 755, quoted
in n. to vss. 130-31.

	|132.  il teschio e l'altre cose~: See Statius, ^Theb.~
VIII, 760-61, quoted in n. to vss. 130-31.

	|135.  per tal convegno~ = ^a tal patto~, "on condition
that."

	|137.  sappiendo~ = ^sapendo~, i.e., ^sapendo io.~

	|chi voi siete~: The two are addressed with "voi."

	|pecca~ = ^peccato~ (see ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 115).

	|138.  te ne cangi~: "I may make up for it," "I may repay
you for it," i.e., by rehabilitating the memory of you and
denigrating his.  This phrase depends on "per tal convegno,
che..."  (vss. 135-36).

	|cangi~ = ^cambi.~

	|139.  quella con ch'io parlo~: My tongue.

	|non si secca~: Porena comments that this means "if my 
tongue is not struck with paralysis" and points out that the adjective
^secco~ ("dry"), meaning "crippled by paralysis," is still current in
Tuscany.  As Rossi says, this is a sinister oath to keep the promise
and translated into a more vulgar but no less energetic phrase would
sound like this: "May I drop dead if I don't keep my promise."  Torraca
suggests that the image arises from the pain of Cocytus itself and
notes that it is still customary to say that great cold withers the
skin, the ears.
