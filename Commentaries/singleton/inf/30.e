	|2.  Semel@e~: Semele was the daughter of Cadmus, king of
Thebes, and Harmonia and the sister of Ino, Agave, Autono,e, and
Polydorus (not the same Polydorus mentioned in vs. 18; see n. to
vss. 16-21).  She was beloved by Jupiter, by whom she became the
mother of Bacchus.  Juno, in order to avenge herself upon Jupiter
for his unfaithfulness to her, appeared to Semele in the guise of
her aged nurse Beroe and induced her to ask Jupiter to show
himself to her in the same splendor and majesty in which he
appeared to Juno.  Jupiter, knowing the danger, reluctantly
complied with Semele's request and appeared before her as the god
of thunder, whereupon she was struck by lightning and consumed to
ashes (see ^Par.~ XXI, 6; Ovid, ^Metam.~ III, 259 309)./ For the
accent on the final syllable of Greek names, as in Semele, see
^Inf.~ V, 4 and the note; XIV, 131 and the note; and E. G.
Parodi (1957), pp. 233-34.

	|3.  una e altra fiata~: Compare the wording in ^Inf.~ X,
50./ With this phrase Dante may be alluding to more than the two
victims of Juno's wrath against the Theban blood here specified,
Semele and Athamas.  Another instance may be the destruction of
Pentheus, son of Semele's sister Agave.

	|4-12.  Atamante...carco~: Athamas, king of Orchomenus in
Boeotia, was the son of Aeolus and Enarete.  At the command of
Juno, Athamas married Nephele; but he was secretly in love with
Semele's sister, the mortal Ino, by whom he had two sons,
Learchus and Melicertes.  Possibly because he was unfaithful to
Nephele, or because Ino was the nurse of Bacchus, son of Semele
and Jupiter, Athamas incurred the wrath of Juno, who afflicted
him with madness.  He mistook Ino and her two sons for a lioness
and cubs and, seizing Learchus, dashed him against a rock.  Ino
flung herself with Melicertes into the sea.  Dante's allusion to
this story, especially his vss. 7-12, closely follows Ovid (see
^Metam.~ IV, 512-30):

     Protinus Aeolides media furibundus in aula
     clamat "io, comites, his retia tendite silvis!
     hic modo cum gemina visa est mihi prole leaena"
     utque ferae sequitur vestigia coniugis amens
     deque sinu matris ridentem et parva Learchum
     bracchia tendentem rapit et bis terque per auras
     more rotat fundae rigidoque infantia saxo
     discutit ora ferox; tum denique concita mater,
     seu dolor hoc fecit seu sparsi causa veneni,
     exululat passisque fugit male sana capillis
     teque ferens parvum nudis, Melicerta, lacertis
     "euhoe Bacche" sonat: Bacchi sub nomine Iuno
     risit et "hos usus praestet tibi" dixit "alumnus!"
     inminet aequoribus scopulus: pars ima cavatur
     fluctibus et tectas defendit ab imbribus undas,
     summa riget frontemque in apertum porrigit aequor;
     occupat hunc (vires insania fecerat) Ino
     seque super pontum nullo tardata timore
     mittit onusque suum; percussa recanduit unda.

     Straightway cried Athamas, the son of Aeolus, madly raving
     in his palace halls: "Ho! my comrades, spread the nets here
     in these woods! I saw here but now a lioness with her two
     cubs"; and madly pursued his wife's tracks as if she were a
     beast of prey.  His son, Learchus, laughing and stretching
     out his little hands in glee, he snatched from the mother's
     arms, and whirling him round and round through the air like
     a sling, he madly dashed the baby's head against a rough
     rock.  Then the mother, stung to madness too, either by
     grief or by the sprinkled poison's force, howling wildly,
     and, quite bereft of sense, with hair streaming, she fled
     away, bearing thee, little Melicerta, in her naked arms, and
     shouting "Ho! Bacchus!" as she fled.  At the name of
     Bacchus, Juno laughed in scorn and said: "So may your
     foster-son ever bless you!"  A cliff o'erhung the sea, the
     lower part of which had been hollowed out by the beating
     waves, and sheltered the waters underneath from the rain.
     Its top stood high and sharp and stretched far out in front
     over the deep.  To this spot -- for madness had made her
     strong -- Ino climbed, and held by no natural fears, she
     leaped with her child far out above the sea.  The water
     where she fell was churned white with foam.

	|8.  al varco~: See the same expression in ^Inf.~ XII,
26.  This can be translated freely, "as they pass by."

	|11.  rotollo~ = ^lo rot@o.~  See Ovid's use of "rotat" in
^Metam.~ IV, 518, quoted in n. to vss. 4-12,
above.

	|percosselo~ = ^lo percosse.~

	|12.  quella~: Ino.

	|l'altro carco~: This is the other son, Melicertes, with whom
Ino had fled.  See "andar carcata" in vs. 6.

	|carco~ = ^carico.~

	|13.  la fortuna volse in basso~: In the familiar image
of Fortune turning her wheel.  See ^Inf.~  VII, 73-96.

	|14.  l'altezza de' Troian che tutto ardiva~: See ^Inf.~
I, 75, "superbo Ili@on"; ^Purg.~ XII, 61-63.  The "all-daring
loftiness of the Trojans" had been manifested in the rash refusal
of Laomedon, king of Troy and father of Priam, to pay Neptune and
Apollo the wages they had earned in serving him, and in the
abduction of Helen by Paris, son of Priam.

	|15.  s@i che 'nsieme col regno il re fu casso~: See
Ovid, ^Metam.~ XIII, 403-4: "Inposita est sero tandem manus
ultima bello./ Troia simul Priamusque cadunt."  ("The final blow
was at last given to the longdrawn war.  Troy fell and Priam with
it.")

	|il re~: Priam.

	|casso~: See ^Inf.~ XXV, 76; also ^Aen.~ XI, 104: "Nullum cum
victis certamen et aethere cassis."  ("No war, they plead, is waged
with vanquished men, bereft of air of heaven.")

	|16-21.  Ecuba trista...torta~: After the fall of Troy,
Hecuba, widow of Priam, king of Troy, and her daughter Polyxena
were taken captive by the Greeks.  On their way to Greece,
Polyxena was torn from Hecuba and sacrificed on the tomb of
Achilles (see n. to vs. 17); and soon after, the lifeless body of
Hecuba's son Polydorus, who had been murdered by Polymestor, king
of Thrace, was washed up on the shore.  Mad with grief, Hecuba
was changed into a dog and in this state leaped into the sea at a
place thenceforward called Cynossema, or "tomb of the dog."
Dante's account here apparently derives from Ovid (^Metam.~ XIII,
404-571).  Compare, for example, Hecuba's grief at the death of
Polyxena in ^Metam.~ XIII, 494-95:

     nata, tuae -- quid enim superest? -- dolor ultime matris,
     nata, iaces, videoque tuum, mea vulnera, vulnus...

     O child, your mother's last cause for grief -- for what else
     is left me -- my child, low you lie, and I see your wound, my
     wound.

And note Hecuba's discovery of Polydorus' body as told by Ovid
(^Metam.~ XIII, 536-37, 539-40):

     adspicit eiectum Polydori in litore corpus
     factaque Threiciis ingentia vulnera telis;
     ..........................
     et pariter vocem lacrimasque introrsus obortas
     devorat ipse dolor...

     And there she saw the body of Polydorus, cast up upon the
     shore, covered with gaping wounds made by Thracian
     spears....Her very grief engulfed her powers of speech, her
     rising tears.

See ^Metam.~ XIII, 40-46, where Ovid tells of Hecuba's
transformation into a dog:

     ...Priameia coniunx
     perdidit infelix hominis post omnia formam
     externasque novo latratu terruit auras...

     The poor wife of Priam after all else lost her human form
     and with strange barking affrighted the alien air....

Ovid also describes Hecuba's metamorphosis in ^Metam.~ XIII,
568-70:

     ...rictuque in verba parato
     latravit, conata loqui: locus exstat et ex re
     nomen habet...

     And, though her jaws were set for words, [she] barked when
     she tried to speak.  The place still remains and takes its
     name from this incident....

See also Seneca, ^Agamemnon~, vs. 708: "Circa ruinas rabida
latravit suas."  ("Around her ruined walls madly she barked.")

	|17.  Polissena~: Polyxena was the daughter of Priam and
Hecuba.  After the fall of Troy, when the Greeks were on their
voyage home, bearing Hecuba and Polyxena as captives, the shade
of Achilles, who had been enamored of Polyxena, appeared and
demanded that she be sacrificed to him.  She was thereupon slain
by Pyrrhus (Neoptolemus), Achilles' son, on the tomb of his
father.  The incident is related by Ovid (^Metam.~ XIII, 439-52).

	|18.  Polidoro~: Polydorus was the son of Priam and
Hecuba.  Just before Troy fell into the hands of the Greeks,
Priam entrusted Polydorus, together with a large sum of money, to
Polymestor, a Thracian king, but after the destruction of Troy
Polymestor killed Polydorus for the sake of the treasure and cast
his body into the sea.  Subsequently the body was washed up on
the shore and was found and recognized by Hecuba, who avenged her
son's murder by putting out Polymestor's eyes and killing his two
children. The story of Polydorus' murder is told by Ovid
(^Metam.~  XlII, 42938).

	|21.  f$e~ = ^fece.~

	|torta~: "Wrenched" out of her mind.

	|22.  Ma n$e di Tebe furie n$e troiane~: Not such raging
madness as was seen in Athamas, king of Thebes, and in Hecuba,
queen of Troy.

	|23.  in alcun~: "Against anyone."

	|24.  punger~: Literally, "to goad," hence "to wound"
(^si videro~ is understood).

	|bestie~: As in the case of Athamas, who in his madness saw his
wife as a lioness.

	|nonch$e membra umane~: The reference is probably to the fact
that Hecuba in her fury tore out the eyes of Polymestor (see Ovid,
^Metam.~ XIII, 561-64).

	|25.  quant'~: That is, ^quanto crude.~

	|due ombre~:  These two shades are to be seen as two furies in
terms of the simile.

	|smorte~: These souls, for all their furious running here and
there about this tenth ^bolgia~, are sick and pale like the rest.

	|26-27.  mordendo correvan di quel modo...si schiude~:
The comparison clearly suggests that these souls run on all
fours.  The hog, when let out from the sty to pasture, runs
hungrily here and there, biting at grass or at anything it can
devour.  The animal has its own peculiar way of running, with a
kind of rocking motion from front to back, an image that the
verses are no doubt intended to evoke.

	|28-29.  nodo del collo~: The nape of the neck.

	|29.  l'assann@o~ = ^l'azzann@o.~  See the use of "sanna"
("tusk") in ^Inf.~ XXII, 56.  The verb thus keeps the image of
the hog or boar.

	|30.  grattar li fece~: An ironical, derisive touch.  See
^Inf.~ XXIX, 79-84.

	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|31.  l'Aretin~: Griffolino (see ^Inf.~ XIX, 109-
20).

	|che rimase, tremando~: Deprived as he is of "mutual
support" (^Inf.~ XXIX, 97), he is still trembling.

	|32.  folletto~: Possible meanings are "pixy," "goblin."
Note the following passage from Gervase of Tilbury (^Otia
imperialia~ I, 18):

     Sunt et alii, quos ^Folletos~ vulgus nominat, qui domos
     simplicium rusticorum inhabitant, et nec aqua, nec
     exorcismis arcentur, et quia non videntur, ingredientes
     lapidibus, lignis et domestica supellectile affligunt,
     quorum verba utique humano more audiuntur, et effigies non
     comparent.

     There are other [spirits] commonly called ^Folletos~
     (goblins), which inhabit the houses of simple peasants and
     cannot be removed by [holy] water or exorcisms, and because
     they cannot be seen, they throw stones, pieces of wood, or
     household objects at anyone who enters.  Their words sound
     like human words; but they do not show themselves.

Torraca points out that in quite a few parts of Italy this belief
still persists.

	|Gianni Schicchi~: A Florentine (died ^ca.~ 1280) of the
Cavalcanti family, noted for his powers of mimicry.  On the sin of
impersonation for which Gianni Schicchi is punished here, see vss.
42-45.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ describes the circumstances of the
fraud in detail:

     Questo Gianni Sticchi fu de' Cavalcanti da Firenze, et
     dicesi di lui che, essendo messer Buoso Donati aggravato
     d'una infermit@a mortale, volea fare testamento, per@o che
     gli parea avere a rendere assai dell'altrui.  Simone suo
     figliuolo il tenea a parole, per ch'egli nol facesse; et
     tanto il tenne a parole ch'elli mor@i.  Morto che fu, Simone
     il tenea celato, et avea paura ch'elli non avessi fatto
     testamento mentre ch'egli era sano; et ogni vicino dicea
     ch'egli l'avea fatto.  Simone, non sappiendo pigliare
     consiglio, si dolse con Gianni Sticchi et chiesegli
     consiglio.  Sapea Gianni contraffare ogni uomo, et colla
     voce et cogli atti, et massimamente messer Buoso, ch'era uso
     con lui.  Disse a Simone: Fa venire uno notajo, et di' che
     messer Buoso voglia fare testamento: io enterr@o nel letto
     suo, et cacceremo lui dirietro, et io mi fascer@o bene, et
     metterommi la cappellina sua in capo, et far@o il testamento
     come tu vorrai: @e vero che io ne voglio guadagnare.  Simone
     fu in concordia con lui: Gianni entra nel letto, et mostrasi
     appenato, et contraff@a la voce di messer Buoso che
     parea tutto lui, et comincia a testare et dire: Io lascio
     soldi xx all'opera di santa Reparata, et lire cinque a'
     Frati Minori, et cinque a' Predicatori, et cos@i viene
     distribuendo per Dio, ma pochissimi danari.  A Simone
     giovava del fatto: et lascio, soggiunse, cinquecento fiorini
     a Gianni Sticchi.  Dice Simone a messer Buoso: Questo non
     bisogna mettere in testamento; io gliel dar@o come voi
     lascerete -- Simone, lascerai fare del mio a mio senno: io ti
     lascio s@i bene, che tu d@ei essere contento -- Simone per
     paura si stava cheto.  Questi segue: Et lascio a Gianni
     Sticchi la mula mia; ch@e avea messer Buoso la migliore mula
     di Toscana.  Oh, messer Buoso, dicea Simone, di cotesta mula
     si cura egli poco et poco l'avea cara: io so ci@o che Gianni
     Sticchi vuole meglio di te.  Simone si comincia adirare et a
     consumarsi; ma per paura si stava.  Gianni Sticchi segue: Et
     lascio a Gianni Sticchi fiorini cento, che io debbo avere da
     tale mio vicino: et nel rimanente lascio Simone mia reda
     universale con questa clausula, ch'egli dovesse mettere ad
     esecuzione ogni lascio fra quindici d@i, se non, che tutto
     il reditaggio venisse a' Frati Minori del convento di Santa
     Croce; et fatto il testamento, ogni uomo si part@i.  Gianni
     esce del letto, et rimettonvi messer Buoso, et lievono il
     pianto, et dicono ch'egli @e morto.

     This Gianni Schicci was of the Cavalcanti of Florence, and
     the story is told of him that when Messer Buoso Donati was
     stricken with a fatal illness, he wanted to make a will, for
     he knew he had a great many things to give back to others.
     His son Simone put him off with words, to prevent his doing
     it; and he put him off so long that he finally died.  When
     he was dead, Simone kept him hidden, afraid he might have
     made a will while he was healthy.  Indeed, all the neighbors
     said he had made one.  Not knowing what to do, Simone
     unburdened himself to Gianni Schicchi and asked his advice.
     Gianni knew how to imitate the voice and actions of
     everyone, and especially of Messer Buoso, whom he knew very
     well.  He said to Simone: "Have a notary come, and tell him
     that Messer Buoso wants to make a will.  I will get into the
     bed, and we'll shove him behind it.  I will cover myself
     well, put on his nightcap, and will make a will just as you
     want it.  Of course, I want to get something out of it
     myself." Simone agreed.  Gianni gets into the bed, pretends
     to be in great pain, and imitates the voice of Messer Buoso
     so well that it seems to be he.  Then he begins to dictate
     the will, saying: "I leave twenty soldi to the ^opera~ of
     Santa Reparata, five lire to the Friars Minor, five to the
     Dominicans," and so on, giving for God, but in small
     amounts.  This was what Simone wanted."And," he adds, "I
     leave five hundred florins to Gianni Schicchi." Simone says
     to Messer Buoso: "You needn't put that in the will.  I'll
     give them to him, just as you say."  "Simone, you will let
     me dispose of my own property as I see fit.  I am leaving
     you so well off that you will be satisfied." Simone kept
     quiet, out of fear.  And then the other continues: "I leave
     Gianni Schicchi my mule" -- for Messer Buoso had the best mule
     in Tuscany."Oh, Messer Buoso," said Simone, "he cares little
     about that mule, and never prized it particularly.  I know
     what Gianni Schicchi wants better than you do."  Simone
     began to get angry and to fume; but out of fear, he kept
     quiet.  Gianni Schicchi goes on: "And I leave Gianni
     Schicchi one hundred florins, which my neighbor so-and-so
     owes me.  And all the rest I leave to my heir Simone, on
     this condition: that he carry out each of my bequests within
     the next fifteen days.  If not, the whole estate is to go to
     the Friars Minor of the convent of Santa Croce."  When the
     will was finished, everyone left.  Gianni gets out of the
     bed, and they put Messer Buoso back in. Then they begin to
     wail, and say he just died.

	|33.  rabbioso~: In the context of the animal similes
here this adjective implies that the spirit is rabid in the sense
of being affected with rabies (as in vss. 46 and 79).

	|conciando~: The word means "dressing," "bedecking,"
hence its use here is ironical.  See ^Inf.~ XXVIII, 37 and the
note for another word used with similar irony.

	|34-35.  se l'altro...a dosso~: The familiar formula of
adjuration.

	|38.  Mirr@a~: Myrrha was the daughter of Cinyras, king
of Cyprus.  Seized with a fatal passion for her father, she
contrived, with the aid of her nurse, to introduce herself in
disguise into his chamber during the absence of her mother.  When
Cinyras discovered the deception, he attempted to slay Myrrha,
but she escaped and wandered to Arabia, where she was transformed
into a myrrh tree and gave birth to Adonis.  In his ^Epist.~ VII,
24, Dante describes her as "hec Myrrha scelestis et impia in
Cinyre patris amplexus exestuans" ("the foul and impious Myrrha
that burns for the embraces of her father Cinyras").  Ovid tells
the story in ^Metam.~ X, 298-513; also see his ^Ars amat.~ I,
285-88.

	|42.  sostenne~: "Ventured," "dared"; the verb
"falsificare" (vs. 44) depends on this verb.

	|43.  la donna de la torma~: The lead mule, queen of the
herd.

	|44.  Buoso Donati~: The Buoso Donati whom Gianni
Schicchi is said to have impersonated was probably the son of
Vinciguerra di Donato del Pazzo.  He lived from the last decades
of the twelfth century to about the middle of the thirteenth
century and appears to have died a widower without direct heirs.
Collusion in the crime by a nephew of his named Simone is related
by some of the early commentators.  Buoso di Vinciguerra did have
a nephew by that name who was the father of Corso Donati, the
leader of the Neri faction of the Florentine Guelphs.  For this
identification and supporting documents, see M. Barbi (1934b),
pp. 305-22.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ refers to Simone as the
son of Buoso Donati (see n. to vs. 32).

	|45.  dando al testamento norma~: "Giving due form to the
will," which may mean due legal form or simply the form
calculated to serve his fraudulent purpose.

	|46.  fuor~ = ^furono~

	|48.  rivolsilo~ = ^lo rivolsi.~

	|mal nati~: See ^Inf.~ V, 7; XVIII, 76.  Among the ill-born
shades to whom the wayfarer now turns his attention are the falsifiers
of money.

	|49.  fatto a guisa di leuto~: With his swollen belly and
emaciated head and neck, Master Adam (named in vs. 61), if he had
had his legs cut off, would have looked like a lute.  The image
is precise, for the belly of the lute swells toward the bottom.
Adam's legs are apparently so dwarfed by the huge paunch that
they can be counted out of the picture; he may be sitting cross-
legged or in some other way so that they are covered by his
enormous paunch.

	|50.  l'anguinaia~ = ^l'inguinaia, l'inguine.~

	|51.  tronca~ = ^troncata.~

	|altro~: On this use of the word, see N. Zingarelli (1906), pp.
368-74.

	|52.  La grave idropes@i~: Benvenuto says of the dropsy
that "reddit hominem gravem, ita ut moveri non possit."  ("It
renders a man heavy, so that he cannot move.")  See Fra Giordano
da Rivalto, ^Prediche inedite~ LIX (1867 edn., p.  303):
"L'idropico, quanto pi@u mangia e bee, quegli omori si corrompono
tutti e convertonsi in mali omori flemmatici; e per@o quanto pi@u
bee e mangia, pi@u enfia e cresce il male, e pi@u ha sete."
("When someone with dropsy eats and drinks more and more, those
humors are corrupted and convert themselves into bad phlegmatic
humors.  And therefore the more he eats and drinks, the more the
illness grows and swells, and he becomes thirstier.")

	|idropes@i~ = ^idropisia.~

	|56.  l'etico~: One affected with hectic fever, a wasting
disease attended by flushed cheeks and a hot, dry skin.

	|58-59.  O voi che...perch$e~ Evidently Master Adam
overheard what Virgil said to Griffolino and Capocchio in the
previous canto (see ^Inf.~ XXIX, 94-96) and hence knows that
Virgil and Dante are not souls going to their punishment in lower
Hell; but in his passing puzzlement over this fact there is an
unmistakable note of sarcasm.

	|58-61.  O voi che...maestro Adamo~: See Lam. 1: 12: "O
vos omnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte, si est
dolor sicut dolor meus."  ("O all ye that pass by the way, attend,
and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow.") Also see
^Inf.~ XXVIII, 130-32; ^Vita nuova~ VII, 3.

	|61.  maestro Adamo~: According to the ^Anonimo
fiorentino~, Master Adam was from Brescia, but this is now
seriously questioned (see G. Livi, 1921; G. Contini, 1953, pp.
7-8, n. 1).  At the instigation of the Conti Guidi of Romena,
Master Adam counterfeited the gold florin of Florence, in coins
containing twenty-one carats of gold instead of the legal
standard of twenty-four carats (see vss. 89-90).  The fraud was
soon detected, and the Florentines, jealous of the purity of
their coinage, which had become a standard throughout
Christendom, caused the false coiner to be burned alive in 1281
(see n. to vs. 75, below).

	|62.  assai di quel ch'i' volli~: Money, principally, the
fruit of his clever counterfeiting.  Given the context, there is
something of the notion of a thirst for gold in the turn of
phrase.

	|63.  un gocciol~ = ^una gocciola~, but ^gocciolo~ may
denote an even smaller droplet than ^gocciola.~  Compare the rich
man in Luke 16:23-24.

	|64-66.  Li ruscelletti...molli~: Master Adam fairly
caresses the image (note "imagine," vs. 68), which, as he says,
adds to his torment.  This is evident in the suffix -^etti~; and
the phrase "faccendo i lor canali freddi e molli" is especially
expressive, since clearly he craves coolness and moistness for
his own parched throat.  Many little streams do rise in the
Casentino, a beautiful region of the upper valley of the Arno and
Tuscan Apennines, dominated in Dante's day by several branches of
the family of the Conti Guidi./ For the use of "freddi" and
"molli" in conjunction, see Virgil, ^Eclog.~ X, 42: "Hic gelidi
fontes, hic mollia prata."  ("Here are cold springs, here soft
meadows.")

	|64.  d'i~ = ^dei~

	|71.  tragge~ = ^trae.~

	|tragge cagion del~: "Draws on," "makes use of."

	|72.  a metter pi@u li miei sospiri in fuga~: Scartazzini
(1st edn.) explains that the phrase means "a farmi sospirare
pi@u spesso.  Quanto pi@u frequenti escono i sospiri, tanto pi@u
velocemente essi fuggono, l'uno spingendo l'altro e quasi
mettendolo in fuga" ("to make me sigh more often -- the more
frequently sighs come forth, the quicker they flee, the one
pushing the other, putting it, as it were, to flight").

	|73.  Ivi~: In the Casentino.

	|Romena~: A castle in the village of Romena in the Casentino,
near Pratovecchio, which in Dante's time belonged to the Conti Guidi.
The ruins of the castle are still standing.  One line of the family (to
which the three brothers named in vs. 77 belonged) took its name from
Romena.

	|74.  la lega suggellata del Batista~: The Florentine
gold florin was stamped on one side with the flower of the lily
(the name ^fiorino~, "florin," comes from ^fiore~, "flower") and
on the other with the image of John the Baptist, patron saint of
Florence.  The florin was first minted in 1252, according to
Villani (VI, 53): "E allora si cominci@o la buona moneta d'oro
fine di ventiquattro carati, che si chiamano fiorini d'oro."
("And then they began to make good coins of fine twenty-four-
carat gold, which are called ^fiorini d'oro [~ gold florins].")

	|75.  il corpo s@u arso~: Burning alive at the stake was
a customary punishment for counterfeiting, a crime against the
state.  Paolino di Piero in his ^Cronica~ (MCCLXXXI), says: "Nel
milledugentottantuno...si trovaro Fiorini di oro falsi in
quantitade per un fuoco, che si apprese in Borgo San Lorenzo...e
dissesi, che li facea fare uno de' Conti da Romena, e funne preso
un loro spenditore, e per cose, che confess@o, s@i fu arso."  ("In
1281 ...a large number of counterfeit gold florins was
discovered because of a fire that broke out in the Borgo San
Lorenzo...and it is said that one of the counts of Romena had
them made.  One who disbursed on their behalf was seized, and
because of the things he confessed, he was burned.")

	|77.  Guido...Alessandro...lor frate~: Guido II da
Romena, his brother Alessandro, and -- since the brothers were
four -- either Aghinolfo or Ildebrandino.  On the genealogy of the
Conti Guidi, particularly the counts of Romena, see F. Torraca
(1904).

	|78.  Fonte Branda~: Perhaps the reference here is to the
celebrated fountain at Siena (mention of which occurs as early as
1081), situated at the foot of the hill upon which the church of
San Domenico stands; the fountain was so called after the Brandi
family, to whom the site at one time belonged.  However, another
fountain of the same name (now almost dry, but the existence of
which is attested to by its mention in ancient documents), near
the castle of Romena and thus much closer than Siena to the scene
of Master Adam's crime, may be the one alluded to.  The early
commentators take the reference to be to the Fonte Branda at
Siena, but this may be because it was better known. On this
question, see E. Londi (1908), pp. 115-17; A. Bassermann (1902),
p. 91.

	|79.  Dentro c'@e l'una gi@a~: This has to be Guido, who
died before 1300, the year in which the action of the poem takes
place.  The other brothers were still alive in 1300.

	|79-80.  se l'arrabbiate ombre...dicon vero~: These
shades -- of the falsifiers of persons -- apparently run around the
whole ^bolgia~ and occasionally carry news, though this hardly
befits their mad condition and antics.

	|81.  le membra legate~: The limbs are "bound" by dropsy
and the heaviness caused by that malady.

	|82-87.  S'io fossi...ci ha~: Greater hate hath no man,
nor any soul in Hell! Porena has calculated that it would take
Master Adam seven hundred thousand years to make his way around
the whole circle of the ^bolgia~-- yet it should be remembered
that he has all eternity before him!

	|84.  io sarei messo~ = ^io mi sarei messo.~

	|85.  sconcia~ = ^sconciata.  "Disfigured," "deformed."

	|86.  ella~: The unexpressed antecedent is ^bolgia.~

	|86-87.  volge undici miglia...ha~: Exactly half the
circumference of the ninth ^bolgia~ (see ^Inf.~ XXIX, 9).  Such
precise measurements are calculated to add realism to the
description of Hell, but they in fact show a curious indifference
to reality; for if the ^bolgia~ is half a mile or more across, it
is hard to conceive the size of the bridge that would be required
to span it.

	|87.  non ci ha~: To be read ^n@oncia~ so as to rhyme
with "oncia" (vs. 83) and "sconcia" (vs. 85).  For comparable
rhymes, see ^Inf.~ VII, 28; XXVIII, 123.

	|ci ha~: "There is."

	|89.  e'~ = ^ei.~  The three Conti Guidi mentioned in vs.
77.

	|90.  tre carati di mondiglia~: The ^Anonimo fiorentino~
(in the gloss on vs. 73) comments: "Erono buoni di peso ma non di
lega; per@o ch'egli erano di xxi carati, dove elli debbono essere
di xxiiii: s@i che tre carati v'avea dentro di rame o d'altro
metallo."  ("They were of good weight but not of good composition,
for they were only twenty-one carats instead of twenty-four.  The
other three carats were made up of copper or some other [base]
metal.")  For the statutory composition of the florin, see the
quotation from Villani in n. to vs. 74, above.

	|92.  fumman~ = ^fumano.

	|fumman come man bagnat 'l verno~: Wet hands "smoke" when
exposed to the cold air of winter.  These spirits, however, steam
because of the burning fever they suffer, as vs. 99 indicates.
|verno~ = ^inverno.~

	|93.  stretti~: The adjective may be understood to mean
that the two are lying close together or that they are close to
Master Adam's right "frontier."  The latter sense seems
preferable.

	|94.  volta non dierno~: They have not moved or turned
over in any way.

	|dierno (dierono)~ = ^diedero.~

	|95.  greppo~: Literally, a precipitous slope.

	|96.  che dieno~: I.e., ^che dieno volta.~

	|dieno = diano.~

	|97.  la falsa ch'accus@o Gioseppo~: The wife of
Potiphar, who, after trying in vain to seduce Joseph, made the
false accusation that he had sought to lie with her.  See Gen.
39:620.

	|Gioseppo~: This form, or ^Giuseppo~, was common in
Dante's day.

	|98.  Sinon~: Sinon, the treacherous Greek who during the
siege of Troy allowed himself to be taken prisoner by the Trojans
and then by a lying tale persuaded them to admit within their
walls the famous wooden horse.  See n. to ^Inf.~ XVI, 59.

	|greco di Troia~: Note what Priam, who believed the
lying Sinon, had said to him (^Aen.~ II, 148-49): "Quisquis es,
amissos hinc iam obliviscere Graios; / noster eris."  ("Whoever
thou art, from henceforth forget the Greeks thou hast lost; thou
shalt be ours.")

	|99.  febbre aguta~: See Fra Giordano da Rivalto,
^Prediche inedite~ XLIV (1867 edn., p. 238): "Quando la febbre
@e ^intra vasa~, dentro alle veni, nel sangue, or questa @e la
mala febbre, questa @e detta febbre aguta."  ("When the fever is
^intra vasa~, in the veins, in the blood, it is a bad fever, what
is called a ^febbre aguta [acute fever] .")

	|leppo~: Buti comments: "Leppo @e puzza d'arso unto, come
quando lo fuoco s'appiglia alla pentola o alla padella."  ("^Leppo~
means the stench of burnt grease -- for instance, when the pot or pan
begins to burn.")

	|100.  l'un~: Sinon.

	|101.  nomato s@i oscuro~: I.e., called "false" and a
"Greek from Troy" (vs. 98).

	|102.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|epa~: See vs. 119 and ^Inf.~ XXV, 82.

	|croia~: "Hard," apparently always used in a pejorative
sense See E G. Parodi (1957) p. 279, who cites the Piedmontese
^invern croi~, meaning a "hard winter."

	|103.  Quella son@o come fosse un tamburo~: G. Contini
(1953, p. 11) quotes Bartholomaeus Anglicus, who, in his ^De~
^proprietatibus rerum~, speaks of a kind of dropsy in which
"extenditur venter et sonat sicut tympanum...collum et extrema
efficiuntur gracilia."  ("The stomach is distended and resounds
like a drum...the neck and the extremities become very thin.")
V. Cian (1902, p. 113, n. 1) also quotes this passage.

	|104.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|110.  avei~ = ^avevi.~

	|presto~: "Ready," "quick" to strike out.  This is a taunt,
since Master Adam went to the stake bound.

	|112-114.  Tu di' ver...richesto~: The repetition of "ver"
is notably emphatic.

	|112.  di'~ = ^dici.~

	|115.  e~: The value of this conjunction in such a
construction is evident in a sonnet by Cecco Angiolieri addressed
to Dante (see M. Marti, 1956, p. 231):

     Dante Alighier, s'i' so' bon begolardo,
     tu mi tien' bene la lancia a le reni;
     s'eo desno con altrui, e tu vi ceni;
     s'eo mordo 'l grasso, e tu vi suggi 'l lardo;
     s'eo cimo'l panno, e tu vi freghi il cardo...

     Dante Alighieri, if I am a writer of nonsense, you are not
     far behind me.  If I dine with others, you eat supper there.
     If I bite the fat, you suck the lard.  If I shear the cloth,
     you card it.

	|117.  e tu per pi@u ch'alcun altro demonio~: As if every
florin Master Adam falsified had counted as a sin.

	|118.  Ricorditi~: The impersonal ^ricordare~ with the
pronoun in the dative.

	|spergiuro~: Sinon had sworn by the gods.  His oath-taking is
described in ^Aen.~ II, 152-59:

     ...ille, dolis instructus et arte Pelasga,
     sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas:
     "vos, aeterni ignes, et non violabile vestrum
     testor numen," ait, "vos arae ensesque nefandi,
     quos fugi, vittaeque deum, quas hostia gessi:
     fas mihi Graiorum sacrata resolvere iura,
     fas odisse viros atque omnia ferre sub auras,
     si qua tegunt..."

     The other, schooled in Pelasgian guile and craft, lifted to
     the stars his unfettered hands: "Ye, O everlasting fires,"
     he cries, "and your inviolable majesty, be ye my witness;
     ye, O altars, and accursed swords which I escaped, and
     chaplets of the gods, which I wore as victim! rightly may I
     break my solemn obligations to the Greeks, rightly hate them
     and bring all things to light if they hide aught."

	|120.  sieti~ = ^ti sia.~

	|reo~: A torment to you.

	|tutto il mondo sallo~: The ^Aeneid~ relates it, hence "the
whole world must know of it."

	|sallo~ = ^lo sa.~

	|121.  te~: Dative.

	|121-122.  ti crepa...la lingua~: The subject in this
construction is "lingua."

	|123.  t'assiepa~: Hedges (^siepi~) commonly mark
boundaries in Italy, hence this touch connects with the derisive
"coffini" of vs. 93.

	|125.  per tuo mal come suole~: "To your own hurt, as is
[was] its wont" in the world.

	|126.  rinfarcia~ = ^infarcisca.~  ^Ri~ serves to intensify
the verb.

	|127.  l'arsura~: G. Contini (1953, p. 11) quotes from
Bartholomaeus Anglicus, ^De proprietatibus rerum~, the symptoms
of ^febris putrida~: "dolor capilis, malicia anhelitus, sitis et
similia" ("headaches, shortness of breath, thirst, and such
things").

	|128.  Narcisso~: Narcissus, Greek youth, of whom the
nymph Echo became enamored.  Finding him insensible to love, she
pined away in grief and was reduced to nothing but a voice.  To
punish Narcissus for his insensibility, the goddess Nemesis
caused him to see his own image reflected in a fountain,
whereupon he became so enamored of it that he too pined away
gradually, until he was changed into the flower that bears his
name.  Ovid relates the story in ^Metam.~ III, 351-510.

	|134.  volsimi~ = ^mi volsi.~

	|136.  dannaggio~ = ^danno.~

	|138.  come non fosse~ = ^come se non fosse.~

	|139-141.  tal mi fec' io...fare~: By his speechlessness
and his blushing (see ^Inf.~ XXXI, 2), Dante gives ample evidence
of his sense of shame (see vs. 130), but it should also be
remembered that Virgil can read Dante's every thought and so
knows his inner as well as his outer state.

	|142.  Maggior difetto men vergogna lava~: The subject is
"vergogna," the object "difetto."

	|144.  ti disgrava~ = ^disgr@a vati~ (imperative).

	|145.  E fa ragion~: "And know that."  Allegory comes to
the fore in this turn of phrase, for if Virgil can be at Dante's
side simply by his being concerned that it be so, then Virgil
must be Reason, or some such guide.
