	|1.  Taciti~: "Silent," and "thoughtful," as is soon made
plain.

	|soli, sanza compagnia~: The apparent tautology of these
words carries a touch of irony in view of the "company" the
wayfarers have just left behind.

	|2-3.  l'un dinanzi e l'altro dopo, come frati minor~:
Francis of Assisi instructed his brethren always to travel in
bands of two.  Moreover, as the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ explains:
"@E usanza de' Frati minori pi@u che degli altri frati, andando a
cammino, andare l'uno innanzi, quello di pi@u auttorit@a, l'altro
dirietro et seguitarlo."  ("Among the Friars Minor, more so than
among other friars, it is customary, when walking, to have the
one with more authority walk ahead, and the other follow behind
him.")

	|3.  frati minor.~  The Franciscans, who devoted their
lives to poverty and humility, called themselves Friars Minor.

	|4-9.  V@olt' era in su la favola d'Isopo...fissa~:
Aesop, the reputed Greek author of ^Aesop's Fables~, is said to
have lived ^ca.~ 620-550 B.C., but it is doubtful that there was
a historical Aesop who left any written works; scholars now
believe that Aesop belongs solely in the oral tradition.  Although
fables bearing his name were known in Athens during the time of
Aristotle, several of these have been traced to sources
considerably earlier than Aesop's alleged lifetime.

	During the Middle Ages, Aesopean fables circulated in
various Latin and French prose and verse collections.  The fable
of the mouse and the frog, to which Dante here alludes, was a
favorite with medieval writers and appears, for example, in a
collection attributed to Romulus, a writer of the Carolingian
period (see fable I, 3 in L. Hervieux, 1894, p. 196), and in one
by the late-twelfth-century French poet Marie de France (see
fable III, 79-82 in K. Warnke, 1898, p. 16).  Benvenuto says the
fable was included in a small book of selections from Aesop used
by students of Latin, and Buti describes such a book: "Isopo @e
uno libello che si legge a' fanciulli che imparano Grammatica,
ove sono certe favole moralizzate per arrecarli a buoni costumi."
("Aesop is a book read to children learning grammar.  It contains
certain didactic fables to teach them good manners.")  In the
collection of Romulus (I, 3), the fable reads as follows:

     Mus cum transire vellet flumen, a rana petiit auxilium.
     Illa grossum petiit linum, murem sibi ad pedem ligavit, et
     natare coepit.  In medio vero flumine rana se deorsum
     mersit, ut miserrimo vitam eriperet.  Ille validus dum
     teneret vires, milvus e contra volans, murem cum unguibus
     rapuit, simul et ranam pendentem sustulit.
     Sic enim et illis contingit, qui de salute alterius adversa
     cogitant.

     A mouse wanted to cross a river, and asked help of a frog.
     The frog took a long string, tied the mouse to his leg, and
     began to swim.  But in the middle of the river, he dove
     down, to kill the poor mouse.  While the mouse was resisting
     valiantly, a kite flew by, and grabbed him with his claws,
     lifting out the dangling frog at the same time.

     That is what happens to those who want to bring harm to
     others.

In the version of Marie de France, the fable comes to a
different conclusion, one that more closely parallels the
incident in the ^Commedia~: while the mouse and the frog are
struggling in the water, the kite swoops down and carries off the
frog, setting the mouse at liberty.

	From the beginning, the commentators have puzzled over
the application of the fable to the previous canto.  The most
widespread interpretation has been that Dante's phrase "presente
rissa" (vs. 5) refers to the broil described in the closing
verses of Canto XXII: the mouse equals Alichino; the frog,
Calcabrina.  However, N. M. Larkin (1962, pp. 97-99) sheds new
light on the parallel by pointing out that the "beginning"
referred to in vs. 9 is the moment when the two poets, having
arrived at the sixth ^bolgia~, find they cannot cross it without
help -- just as the mouse, arriving at the stream, asks the frog's
assistance.  The "end" referred to in vs. 9, Larkin avers, is the
unhappy tumble of the devils into the pitch (the would-be
tricksters in their malice are tricked by Ciampolo, as the frog
in his malice is seized by the kite).  Larkin stresses the
complete innocence of the intended victim in all versions of the
fable, which makes the gratuitousness of the treachery complete.
He also points out that the equivalence (Dante + Virgil~ = ^mouse;
demons~ = ^frog~) is not precise, since in the poem sets of
characters fill the roles played by individuals in the fable.  He
concludes (p. 99): "The fable, therefore, bears the same relation
to its application in Inferno XXII as ^mo~ does to ^issa~ [vs. 7]:
alike in significance but different in form."

	Larkin's view of the application of the fable of the
mouse and the frog seems correct on the whole, but it might be
even more convincing if the author had respected the all-important
distinction between Dante the character in the poem and Dante the
poet which scholars are coming more and more to observe.  Dante
the character does not yet know that Malacoda has deceived Virgil
in the matter of the bridge over the sixth ^bolgia~, for he and
his guide will know this only at the end of the present canto.
Therefore the wayfarer cannot be comparing Malacoda's treachery
with the frog's.  But he can and does know the evil intent of the
devils, since they are evil by their very nature; he is aware of
their "ill-will" (vs. 16) and fears that they will also be
wrathful, since they have been put to scorn; this suspicion must
serve as sufficient evidence of their intent to deceive.  Later
Dante will have the proof of this evil intent.  For another
interpretation of the fable and Dante's allusion to it, see E.
Mandruzzato (1955-56).

	|6.  el~: Aesop.

	|7.  "mo"... "issa"~: Both words mean "now."  Cf. the Latin
^modo~ (and see vs. 28) and ^ipsa hora.~  For "issa," a Lucchese
form, see ^Purg.~ XXIV, 55; E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 261.

	|8.  l'un con l'altro~: "The one thing with the other."
M. Barbi (1934b, pp. 213-14, 242) points out that the pronouns
are used in a neuter sense.

	|s'accoppia~: "Is coupled," "is paired," "is compared."

	|9.  fissa~ = ^attenta.~

	|11.  quello~: The thought of the correspondence of the
fable with the incident in Canto XXII.

	|12.  la prima paura~: The fear the wayfarer experienced
when Malacoda offered to have his devils escort him and his guide
(see ^Inf.~ XXI, 115-32).

	|mi f$e doppia~: This "double" fear is explained in vs. 16:
"And if anger be added to illwill...."

	|13.  per noi~: "On our account," because of our wish to
question Ciampolo.

	|14.  con danno e con beffa~: A standing phrase, frequent
in Boccaccio and others, for example, in the expression "rimanere
col danno e con le beffe" ("to end up with insult added to
injury").

	|15.  assai credo che lor n@oi~ = ^credo che lor n@oi
assai.~

	|n@oi~: Third person singular, present subjunctive, of
^noiare~, "to vex."

	|16.  s'affueffa~: "Is skeined," "is wound into the
hank," "is added."  Buti comments: "Aggueffare @e filo a filo
aggiugnere."  ("^Aggueffare~ means 'to join thread to thread.' ")

	|17.  ei~ = ^essi~, the devils.

	|ne~ = ^ci.~

	|18.  lievre~ = ^lepre.~

	|19.  sentia~ = ^sentiva.~

	|20.  de la paura~ = ^da la paura.~

	|22.  pavento~ = ^spavento.~

	|23.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|avem~ = ^abbiamo.~

	|25.  piombato vetro~: "Mirror"; see ^Conv.~ III, ix, 8:
"quasi come specchio, che @e vetro terminato con piombo"
("something like a mirror, which is glass with lead behind it").
See also ^Par.~ II, 89-90.

	|26.  trarrei~: "I should draw," i.e., "I should catch."

	|27.  quella dentro~: "Your inner [image]": your
thoughts and feelings.

	|'mpetro~ = ^impetro~: "I obtain," "I receive." See Prov.
27:19.

	|28.  mo~: See n. to vs. 7.

	|venieno~ = ^venivano.~

	|tra ' miei~ = ^tra i miei.~

	|29.  con simile atto e con simile faccia~: The poets'
thoughts (see vss. 5, 28) are personified in this turn of phrase.
And now the opening word of the canto, "Taciti," acquires full
meaning: the two wayfarers were going along "silently" with their
thoughts turned "on what lay behind" (see vs.  20) and ahead of
them.

	|30.  intrambi~: "Both" your thoughts and mine.

	|un sol consiglio~: The "sole resolve" is to escape.

	|fei~ = ^feci.~

	|31.  elli~: Impersonal subject.

	|destra costa~:  Since Virgil and Dante have turned to the left
along the circular bank, the slope to their right is the inner bank of
the next, or sixth, ^bolgia.~

	|giaccia~ = ^penda~; see ^Inf.~ XIX, 35; ^Purg.~ III, 76.
Evidently Virgil cannot yet see whether or not the bank does slope in
such a way that they can descend it to the next ditch; see n. to ^Inf.~
XXI, 106-11.

	|32, 34, 36.  che noi...scendere...rendere...prendere~:
These ^versi sdruccioli~ are most effective in the context.  For
a definition of this verse form, see n. to ^Inf.~ XV, 1, 3.

	|32.  l'altra bolgia~: The sixth.

	|33.  l'imaginata caccia~: The reference is to the
devils' pursuit, which both Virgil and Dante are picturing to
themselves.

	|35.  con l'ali tese~: Like the devil first seen (see
^Inf.~ XXI, 33).

	|36.  volerne~ = ^volerci.~

	|42.  solo una camiscia~: It was the custom of the time
to sleep naked.

	|vesta~: Subjunctive of ^vestire~, following "solo."

	|43.  collo~: The upper edge of the bank, as before (see
^Inf.~ XXII, 116).

	|44.  si diede~: Cf. the Latin ^se dedit~, as in ^Aen.~
XI, 565: "dat sese fluvio" ("plunges into the flood").

	|45.  l'altra bolgia~: The sixth, as in vs. 32.

	|tura~: "Closes."

	|46.  doccia~: "Canal," "conduit," "millrace."  See
^Inf.~ XIV, 117.

	|47.  molin terragno~: The familiar "land mill" is one
situated near a stream or other body of water; its paddles are
set in motion by water brought to it through a sluice.  It should
be distinguished from the water mill, also common in Dante's day,
which was built on a raft set in a stream; its paddles were
turned by the current of the stream.

	|48.  approccia~: "Draws near" (see ^Inf.~ XII, 46).  The
water flows faster as it nears the paddles.

	|49.  vivagno~: "Edge," "margin"; see ^Inf.~ XIV, 123.

	|51.  come suo figlio~: The phrase continues and
completes the simile (vss. 38-42) of the mother who takes up her
child and flees from danger.  Virgil carried Dante in this way
before, when he climbed the bank of the third ^bolgia~ (see
^Inf.~ XIX, 124-29).

	|52.  fuoro~ = ^furono.~

	|53.  e'~ = ^essi~, the devils.

	|colle~: The upper edge of the bank; see vs. 43 and the note.

	|54.  sovresso noi~: "Directly above us"; -^esso~ is an
intensive particle, originally the accusative form of the pronoun
or pronominal adjective, ^ipse.~

	|non l@i era sospetto~:  "There was no [cause for] fear there."

	|57.  poder~ = ^potere.~

	|indi~: From the bank of the fifth ^bolgia.~

	|tolle~ = ^toglie.~

	|58.  L@a gi@a~: Down on the floor of the
ditch.

	|gente dipinta~: The sense in which these people are "painted"
is made clear in vs. 64.  The phrase recalls the "sepulcris dealbatis"
("whited sepulchres") of Matt. 23:27.

	|59.  assai~: Probably this should be construed as
modifying "lenti."

	|62.  taglia~ = ^taglio~, "style."

	|63.  Clugn@i~: Cluny, the famous Benedictine abbey in
Burgundy.  It should be noted, however, that the early
commentators followed the reading ^Cologna~, as do some modern
editors./ G. A. Venturi (1905, p. 239) refers to a letter of
Bernard of Clairvaux to his nephew, who had left the Cistercian
to enter the Cluniac order.  In this letter (^Epistola~ I, 11)
Bernard observes ironically: "Si pelliciae lenes et calidae, si
panni subtiles et pretiosi, si longae manicae et amplum
caputium...sanctum faciunt; quid moror et ego quod te non
sequor?"  ("If sanctity is to be found in soft and delicate robes
made of the finest and most expensive fabrics, with long sleeves
and a full hood...then I do not see why I hold back and do not
follow you.")

	|fassi~ = ^si fa.~

	|64.  elli~: The impersonal "it" refers to the effect of
the bright gold of the robes.

	|65.  gravi~ = ^pesanti.~

	|66.  Federigo~: "The second Frederick" of ^Inf.~ X, 119.
No incontrovertible evidence has been found to prove that
Frederick actually employed such a method of torture, but the
reference here reflects the widespread belief that he did.  On
this mode of punishment, see G. L. Hamilton (1921).

	Although the exact nature of the ^cappa plumbea~, or
"leaden cloak," itself is uncertain, and may have varied, the
punishment by which it was imposed was a recognized one in the
Middle Ages.  Du Cange (vol. II, p. 113), under the first "capa"
entry, subentry "capa plumbea," quotes a document dated 1377
which refers to the punishment of a certain evildoer: "Se nostre
saint pere le Pape savoit l'estat et la vie dont il vivoit, il le
feroit mourir en la Chappe de plonc."  ("If our Holy Father the
pope knew the sort of life he lived, he would have him executed
in the cape of lead.")  Hamilton (1921, pp. 335-41) cites several
earlier references to the punishment.  Lana, whose account was
copied by subsequent commentators, glosses as follows:

     E da sapere che lo imperadore Federigo secondo usava di fare
     fare giustizia a quelli che sommo peccato commetteano contra
     la corona, in questo modo: elli facea fare di piombo una
     coverta al giudicato, la qual tutto lo covr@ia, e questa era
     grossa circa un'oncia; poi facea mettere tal giudicato in
     una caldera, e questa cappa di piombo indosso a colui, poi
     facea fare fuoco sotto la detta caldera: per lo fuoco si
     liquefacea lo ditto piombo, e menava a pezzo a pezzo la
     carne di quello giuso, s@i che infine boll@ia lo piombo e 'l
     giudicato insieme: lo quale giudizio non era senza smisurata
     pena.

     You must know that the Emperor Frederick II used to punish
     those who committed crimes against the crown in the
     following manner: he had a leaden cover made for the
     condemned man, to cover him entirely.  The cover was about
     an inch thick.  Then he had the man placed in a cauldron,
     and the leaden cape put over him.  Then he had a fire made
     under the cauldron. The heat melted the lead, which took the
     skin off piece by piece.  Finally, both the lead and the
     condemned man boiled.  This punishment was not without
     immeasurable pain.

	|66.  le mettea di paglia~: The weight of Frederick's
leaden capes was nothing ("like straw") compared to these.

	|68.  ancor pur~: "As usual," i.e., in the usual
direction of turning; the two poets now fall in with these
sinners -- hypocrites all -- who of course circle to the left.

	|71.  ven@ia~ = ^veniva.~

	|71-72.  s@i pian, che noi eravam...ogne mover d'anca~:
The sinners walk so slowly that the wayfarers come abreast of new
ones at every step they take.

	|76.  la parola tosca~: Dante's Tuscan speech; see ^Inf.~
X, 22; XXII, 99.

	|77-79.  Tenete...correte...avrai...:~ The sinner first
addresses both wayfarers ("Tenete," "correte"), then only Dante
("avrai"), as the one who had asked Virgil to "find someone who
may be known by deed or name" (vss. 73-74).

	|78.  voi che correte~: Typically the sinners notice the
fact (the wayfarers' haste) that most contrasts to their own very
slow pace (see ^Inf.~ XVI, 32-33).

	|aura~ = ^aria.~

	|80.  'l duca si volse~: As usual, Virgil is walking
ahead of his charge and so must turn around to speak to him.

	|81.  poi~: I.e., "when he has reached you."

	|84.  tardavali~ = ^li tardava.~  The verb has a compound
subject, "carco" and "via."

	|via stretta~: The way is narrow because it is crowded with the
slow-paced, heavy-clad sinners.  See ^Inf.~ XIX, 42, where
"fondo...arto" has a similar significance.

	|85.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|con l'occhio bieco~: The two sinners look askance at the
wayfarer, first of all because their heavy cowls and capes make it
difficult for them to turn their heads; such a glance is also quite
descriptive of their hypocritical demeanor.

	|88.  atto de la gola~: Dante's breathing.

	|90.  grave~: The word here means both "heavy" and
"grave."

	|91.  collegio~: The term was commonly used for
assemblies of ecclesiastical persons, and in this sense fits the
context very well.  See Iob 15:34: "Congregatio enim hypocritae
sterilis" ("for the breed of the impious shall be sterile").
Also see Ioan. 11:47 ("Collegerunt...facit," quoted in the key
passage in n. to vss. 115-17, below).

	|92.  ipocriti tristi~: See Matt. 6: 16: "Cum autem
ieiunatis, nolite fieri sicut hypocritae tristes; exterminant
enim facies suas, ut appareant hominibus ieiunantes."  ("And when
you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, who disfigure
their faces in order to appear to men as fasting.")

	|94.  fui nato~ = ^nacqui.~  See ^Conv.~ I, iii, 4:
"Fiorenza...  nel quale nato e nutrito fui in fino al colmo de la
vita mia" ("Florence...wherein I was born, and nurtured until the
culmination of my life").  See also ^Inf.~ V, 97.

	|95.  la gran villa~: Florence was the largest city on
the Arno.

	|villa~ = ^citt@a.~

	|97-98.  a cui tanto distilla quant' i' veggio dolor~:
The subject of "distilla" is "tanto dolor"; the verb is
intransitive here.

	|100.  rance~: "Orange" or "yellow."

	|102.  bilance~: The scales called "balances," which have
a bar supported in the middle and two pans of equal weight
suspended from the extremities, resemble the human figure,
particularly the neck and shoulders.  Such scales, if
overweighted, as these sinners are in their heavy cloaks, do
indeed creak, especially at the point of juncture of the
crossbeam and its support, which in the comparison would be the
necks of the hypocrites.

	|103.  Frati godenti~: The members of a military and
conventual order called the Ordo Militiae Beatae Mariae ("Knights
of the Blessed Virgin Mary") were popularly known as Frati
Gaudenti, or Jovial Friars.  The order was founded in 1261 by
certain citizens of Bologna under the sanction of Urban IV.  lts
object was to make peace between contending factions in the
cities of Italy, to reconcile family feuds, and to protect the
weak against their oppressors.  The nickname Frati Gaudenti,
which was in common use (as is proved by documentary evidence)
within ten years of the foundation of the order, reputedly was
bestowed upon the knights because of the laxity of their rules,
which permitted them to marry and to live in their own homes, and
merely required them to abstain from the use of gold and silver
trappings, from attending secular banquets, and from encouraging
actors.  The knights bound themselves not to take up arms, except
in defense of widows and orphans, and of the Catholic faith, or
for the purpose of making peace between man and man. On the Frati
Gaudenti see Giovanni Gozzadini (1851).  Villani describes the
order's habit and remarks on the aptness of its nickname (VII,
13):

     E' frati godenti erano chiamati cavalieri di santa Maria, e
     cavalieri si faceano quando prendeano quell'abito, che le
     robe aveano bianche e uno mantello bigio, e l'arme il campo
     bianco, e la croce vermiglia con due stelle, e doveano
     difendere le vedove e' pupilli, e intramettersi di paci, e
     altri ordini, come religiosi, aveano.  ...Ma poco dur@o, che
     seguiro al nome il fatto, cio@e, d'intendere pi@u a godere
     che ad altro.

     The Frati Gaudenti were called Knights of the Blessed Virgin
     Mary, and they were knighted when they took the habit, which
     had a white tunic and a gray cape; and their arms had a
     white field on which were a vermilion cross and two stars.
     They were to defend widows and orphans and to serve as
     peacemakers; and as religious men, they had other duties as
     well....But within a short time, their deeds followed their
     name: that is, they were more intent upon enjoying
     themselves than upon anything else.

F. Torraca (1912, pp. 216-19) gives another interpretation of
the nickname.

	|104.  Catalano~: Catalano di Guido di Ostia was born in
Bologna ^ca.~ 1210 (for this form of his name see R. Davidsohn,
1908, pt. 1, p. 590).  He served as ^podest@a~ of various cities
of Emilia and Lombardy; and in 1249 he commanded a division of
the Bolognese infantry at the battle of Fossalta, in which King
Enzio of Sardinia (the illegitimate son of Frederick II) was
defeated and captured.  In 1261, Catalano was associated with
Loderingo degli Andal@o in founding the Frati Gaudenti; and in
1265 and 1267, he and Loderingo shared the office of ^podest@a~
in Bologna.  Shortly after his last term of office, he retired to
the monastery of the Frati Gaudenti at Ronzano near Bologna,
where he died and was buried in 1285.

	|Loderingo~: Loderingo degli Andal@o (born ^ca.~ 1210) belonged
to a Ghibelline family of Bologna.  His career paralleled that of
Catalano: he served as ^podest@a~ in several cities of Emilia and
Tuscany, was among the founders of the Frati Gaudenti, and died at
Ronzano in 1293.  On these two sinners, see G. Gozzadini (1875), pp.
202-10; F.  Torraca (1912), pp. 219-22.

	After the defeat of Manfred and the Ghibellines at
Benevento in February 1266, Pope Clement IV arranged for Catalano
and Loderingo to share the office of ^podest@a~ in Florence.
This seemed conducive to the pope's ostensible purpose of
securing peace between the Florentine Guelphs and Ghibellines:
first, because Loderingo and Catalano jointly serving as
^podest@a~ in Bologna in 1265 had managed to mediate between the
two warring parties of that city; and second, because Loderingo
was a Ghibelline and Catalano a Guelph.  Clement's actual
purpose, however, was to further the interests of the Florentine
Guelphs, while ridding himself of the Ghibellines who remained in
Florence with an army of German mercenaries and constituted a
threat to his power.  Since Catalano and Loderingo owed absolute
obedience to the pope by virtue of their having taken religious
orders, their previous political affiliations meant very little;
in practice they were controlled by the pope.  Thus, during their
term of office there occurred an uprising of the Guelphs, who
drove from Florence the most powerful Ghibelline nobles and the
German mercenaries.  By the spring of 1267, the houses of the
most prominent Ghibelline families lay in ruins (see n. to vs.
108), and the remaining Ghibelline leaders had been condemned to
exile./  On the justice of Dante's charge of hypocrisy against
Catalano and Loderingo, see F. Pintor (1903).

	|105.  tua terra~: Florence.

	|106.  un uom solingo~: The office of ^podest@a~ was
usually held by "one man alone."

	|107.  e fummo tali~: Ironically: "We conserved the peace
so well that.. ."

	|108.  Gardingo~: A part of Florence in the neighborhood
of the Palazzo Vecchio.  In early times it appears to have been
covered with ruins.  According to Villani (I, 38):

     Alcuni dicono che fu ove oggi si chiama il Guardingo di
     costa alla piazza ch'@e oggi del popolo dal palazzo de'
     Priori....Guardingo fu poi nomato l'anticaglia de' muri e
     volte che rimasono disfatte dopo la distruzione di Totile, e
     stavanvi poi le meretrici.

     Some people say [the Campidoglio of Florence] stood in what
     is now the Gardingo, next to what is now called the Piazza
     del Popolo, because of the Palace of the Priors....Later,
     the name Gardingo was given to the ruins of walls and arches
     left by the destruction of Totila; and later, the
     prostitutes inhabited it.

There probably is no truth in the legend that Florence was
destroyed by Totila (see n. to ^Inf.~ XIII, 150).  Actually,
Gardingo was first the name of a tower built by the Longobards to
guard the city (see R. Davidsohn, 1896, pp.  21-22), and the name
was then applied to the area around it (see M. Barbi, 1899, p.
211).  The Uberti, who headed the Ghibelline party in Florence,
built their houses there; and these houses, according to
Benvenuto, were wrecked by the populace during the rising against
the Ghibellines under the joint rule of Catalano and Loderingo
(see n. to vs. 104).

	|109.  i vostri mali...~: The broken-off sentence appears
to leave "mali" ambiguous -- the word can mean "sufferings"; but it
is scarcely conceivable that Dante would have gone on to speak
words of commiseration to this pair; hence "mali" must refer to
all the "ills" that the two had caused.

	|111.  con tre pali~: The sinner is staked to the ground,
with one stake piercing each outstretched hand and the third his
crossed feet.

	|112.  tutto si distorse~: See the description of
Nicholas III, ^Inf.~ XIX, 64: "tutti storse i piedi."  This
sinner writhes in chagrin and rage for the same reason, that he
should be seen and known here by this living man who can go back
and report it to the world above.

	|115-117.  Quel confitto...mart@iri~: Caiaphas, the high
priest, with surpassing hypocrisy "counseled the Pharisees that
it was expedient to put one man to torture for the people." See
Ioan. 11:45-52:

     Multi ergo ex Iudaeis qui venerant ad Mariam et Martham, et
     viderant quae fecit Iesus, crediderunt in eum.  Quidam autem
     ex ipsis abierunt ad pharisaeos, et dixerunt eis quae fecit
     Iesus.  Collegerunt ergo pontifices et pharisaei concilium,
     et dicebant: Quid facimus?  quia hic homo multa signa facit.
     Si dimittimus eum sic, omnes credent in eum; et venient
     Romani, et tollent nostrum locum et gentem.  Unus autem ex
     ipsis, Caiphas nomine, cum esset pontifex anni illius, dixit
     eis: Vos nescitis quidquam; nec cogitatis, quia expedit
     vobis ut unus moriatur homo pro populo, et non tota gens
     pereat.  Hoc autem a semetipso non dixit, sed cum esset
     pontifex anni illius, prophetavit quod Iesus moriturus erat
     pro gente, et non tantum pro gente, sed ut filios Dei qui
     erant dispersi, congregaret in unum.

     Many therefore of the Jews who had come to Mary [and
     Martha], and had seen what he did, believed in him.  But
     some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the
     things that Jesus had done.  The chief priests and the
     Pharisees therefore gathered together a council, and said,
     "What are we doing? for this man is working many signs.  If
     we let him alone as he is, all will believe in him, and the
     Romans will come and take away both our place and our
     nation."  But one of them, Caiphas, being high priest that
     year, said to them, "You know nothing at all; nor do you
     reflect that it is expedient for us that one man die for the
     people, instead of the whole nation perishing."  This,
     however, he said not of himself; but being high priest that
     year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation;
     and not only for the nation, but that he might gather into
     one the children of God who were scattered abroad.

Also see Ioan. 18:14.

	|116.  convenia~ = ^conveniva.~

	|118.  Attraversato~: See Isa. 51:23: "Et ponam illum in
manu eorum qui te humiliaverunt, et dixerunt animae tuae:
Incurvare, ut transeamus; et posuisti ut terram corpus tuum, et
quasi viam transeuntibus."  ("And I will put it in the hand of
them that have oppressed thee and have said to thy soul: Bow
down, that we may go over.  And thou hast laid thy body as the
ground and as a way to them that went over.")  "Attraversato"
probably means, not "crosswise" in the ^bolgia~, but "placed as
something to be traversed, walked on," as the following two
verses make clear.  See ^Purg.~ XXXI, 25: "quai fossi
attraversati."

	|nudo~: A notable feature in this case, since if Caiaphas does
not wear a leaden cape, he is not shielded from the weight of the
others who walk upon him, who weigh themselves upon him as upon a
platform scale, each time they circle.

	|121.  il socero~: Annas, father-in-law of Caiaphas.  See
Ioan.  18:13: "Et adduxerunt eum ad Annam primum.  Erat enim
socer Caiphae, qui erat pontifex anni illius."  ("And they brought
him to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiphas, who
was the high priest that year.")

	|122.  dal concilio~ = ^del concilio~; the "pharisaei
concilium" of Ioan. 11:47 (see quotation in n. to vss. 115-17).

	|123.  mala sementa~: An ironic echo of Ioan. 11:52,
quoted in n. to vss. 115-17.  Also see Matt. 27:25: "Et
respondens universus populus dixit: Sanguis eius super nos, et
super filios nostros."  ("And all the people answered and said,
'His blood be on us and on our children.'")  The blood of Christ
was thus the seed which bore evil fruit in the destruction of
Jerusalem and the dispersal of the Jews.  Dante refers to those
events later in the ^Commedia~ as a "just vengeance" (^Par.~ VII,
20).  See ^Purg.~ XXI, 82-84; ^Par.~ VI, 91-93; VII, 16-51.

	|124.  Allor vid' io maravigliar Virgilio~: The crucified
figures upon the floor of the ditch, Caiaphas, Annas, and the
others, were not there when Virgil passed this way before.
Virgil can marvel also at the particular form of their punishment
and wonder what the reason for it may be, since he died before he
could know that Christ was crucified.  I. Della Giovanna (1901,
p. 25) observed that this is the only time in Hell we see Virgil
marvel.

	|126.  etterno essilio~: All sinners are exiled from
Heaven, God's city.  See ^Inf.~ I, 124-26; ^Purg.~ XXI, 18.

	|127-128.  drizz@o al frate...Non vi dispiaccia~: Virgil
speaks primarily to Fra Catalano (who then answers), but he
includes, with his plural form of address, Fra Loderingo.

	|129.  a la man destra~: The two wayfarers, it should be
remembered, proceed through Hell circling to the left: hence they
have on their right hand the bank that divides the sixth ^bolgia~
from the seventh.

	|foce~: An "opening" which might serve as exit.

	|130.  onde~ = ^per dove.~

	|uscirci~ = ^uscire di qui.~  ^Ci~ here has the meaning
"hence"; see ^Inf.~ IV, 49, 55; VIII, 81.

	|131-132.  sanza costrigner...a dipartirci~: Virgil's
words are ironical.

	|131.  angeli neri~: The devils, fallen angels, are all
black.

	|132.  che vegnan d'esto fondo a dipartirci~ = ^che vegnano
a dipartirci d'esto fondo.~

	|133.  adunque~ = ^allora~; see ^Inf.~ XXII, 64.

	|134.  un sasso~: One of the reefs that span the ^bolge~
like the spokes of a wheel, from the high rock wall ("gran
cerchia") to the pit at the center.  See ^Inf.~ XVIII, 4-18; Fig.
6, p. 312.

	|136.  'n questo @e rotto~: As this stone bridge, which
once spanned the sixth ^bolgia~, has collapsed (contrary to
Malacoda's assertion, ^Inf.~ XXI, 111, 125-26), it seems safe to
conclude that Malacoda was telling the truth when, referring to
the other reef on which the two wayfarers had been crossing the
^bolge~, he said that the sixth arch (which formerly spanned this
sixth ^bolgia~) had also broken down.  From this -- although it is
nowhere declared in so many words -- it may be surmised that over
the ^bolgia~ of the hypocrites ^all~ the rock bridges are broken
down.

	|137.  ruina~: Like the other ^ruine~ of Hell ("ruina"
has an emphatic position in this verse), this one was caused by
the quake that shook the earth when Christ died on the Cross.
Here, then, is a point from which we are able to understand much
in retrospect: the special significance of this and the other two
^ruine~ (see ^Inf.~ V, 34; XII, 4, 32), Malacoda's time
reference, and the we nature of his deception (on which see C.
S. Singleton, 1966).

	|140.  contava~: "Set forth."

	|la bisogna~ = ^la faccenda.~

	|141.  colui~: Malacoda.

	|di qua~: Virgil is standing nearer the bank that separates the
fifth and sixth ^bolge~, with his back to it.

	|142-144.  Io udi' gi@a dire...menzogna~: The trenchant
irony of the friar's words is evident.  See Christ's description
of the devil (Ioan. 8:44): "Ille homicida erat ab initio et in
veritate non stetit, quia non est veritas in eo.  Cum loquitur
mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, quia mendax est et pater eius."
("He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the
truth because there is no truth in him.  When he tells a lie he
speaks from his very nature, for he is a liar and the father of
lies.")

	|143-147.  del diavol vizi assai...mi parti'~: Vss. 143,
145, and 147 constitute what are called, in Italian prosody,
^versi tronchi.~  That is, they end in words accented on the
final syllable ("udi'," "g@i," "parti' ") and have one syllable
less (in this case ten) than the normal measure (eleven).

	|147.  parti'~ = ^partii.~
