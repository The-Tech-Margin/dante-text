	|1.  Lo giorno se n'andava~: See ^Aen.~ III, 147: "Nox
erat et terris animalia somnus habebat." ("It was night and on
earth sleep held the living world.")  See also ^Aen.~ VIII, 26-
27; IX, 224-25.  The "dark air" of evening is now here; the
wayfarer has spent the whole day, from sunrise to sunset, in his
attempt to climb the mountain.

	|2.  animai~ = ^animali~, i.e., all animate creatures,
including man -- a common use of the term both in Latin and in
Dante.  See Virgil's use of "animalia" (n. to vs. I, above).
See also ^Inf.~ V, 88, where Dante is addressed as "animal
grazioso e benigno."

	|3.  io sol uno~: Dante can be said to be alone, since
Virgil is a shade.  See ^Inf.~ I, 67: "Non omo, omo gi@a fui."

	|4.  guerra~: The "battle" or "ordeal."

	|5.  la pietate~: The "pity" that the living man knows he
will feel for the tormented souls of the damned.

	|6.  ritrarr@a la mente che non erra~: "Mente" is used
here in the sense of ^memoria~, a frequent meaning of ^mente~ in
Dante (and of ^mens~ in Latin).  See ^Rime~ L, 1; LXVII, 59.

	Memory will now faithfully retrace the real event of the
journey, exactly as it took place.  This most extraordinary
journey through the three realms of the afterlife is represented,
never as dreamed or experienced in vision, but as a real
happening, involving -- as is made evident in Canto I -- a living man
who goes in the body and who moves always through real space.  It
is now the poet's arduous task to go back over the entire course
of the event as it actually occurred and to give, in verse, a
true report.  Here, then, and in the following invocation, the
poet's voice is heard for the first time as it speaks of his task
as poet.

	|7-9.  O muse...la tua nobilitate~: The invocation is in
the epic style (see, for example, ^Aen.~ VI, 264-67).  Similar
invocations are made at the beginning of the other two
^cantiche.~  For that of the ^Paradiso~ see Dante's own remarks
in his ^Letter to Can Grande (Epist.~ XIII, 46-48).  That the
invocation of the ^Inferno~ is made here in Canto II declares
that this second canto is actually the first of the ^Inferno~
proper (which then, like the other two ^cantiche~, consists of
thirty-three cantos).  ^Inferno~ I thus figures as an
introductory canto or prologue to the whole poem and brings the
total number of cantos to the perfect number of one hundred.

	|7.  alto ingegno~: The poet's own genius, his ^virt@u~
as poet, whereas the Muses are invoked to give inspiration.  Such
a distinction is traditional.  See ^De vulg.  eloqu.~ II, iv, 9-
10, where, after discussing the selection of the poet's ^materia~
and the choice of style, Dante writes:

     Caveat ergo quilibet et discernat ea que dicimus; et
     quando tria hec pure cantare intendit, vel que ad ea
     directe ac pure secuntur, prius Elicone potatus, tensis
     fidibus, adsumptum secure plectrum tum movere in-
     cipiat.  Sed cautionem atque discretionem habere sicut
     decet, hoc opus et labor est, quoniam nunquam sine
     strenuitate ingenii et artis assiduitate scientiarumque
     habitu fieri potest.  Et hii sunt quos Poeta, Eneidorum
     sexto, dilectos Dei et ab ardente virtute sublimatos ad
     ethera Deorumque filios vocat, quanquam figurate
     loquatur.  Et ideo confutetur eorum stultitia, qui, arte
     scientiaque immunes, de solo ingenio confidentes, ad
     summa summe canenda prorumpunt; et a tanta pre-
     sumptuositate desistant; et si anseres natura vel desidia
     sunt, nolint astripetam aquilam imitari.

     Let every one therefore beware and discern what we
     say; and when he purposes to sing of these three subjects
     simply [the three matters for poetry in the tragic style],
     or of those things which directly and simply follow
     after them, let him first drink of Helicon, and then,
     after adjusting the strings, boldly take up his ^plectrum~
     and begin to ply it.  But it is in the exercise of the need-
     ful caution and discernment that the real difficulty lies;
     for this can never be attained to without strenuous
     efforts of genius, constant practice in the art, and the
     habit of the sciences.  And it is those (so equipped)
     whom the poet in the sixth book of the ^Aeneid~ describes
     as beloved of God, raised by glowing virtue to the sky,
     and sons of the Gods, though he is speaking figura-
     tively.  And therefore let those who, innocent of art and
     science, and trusting to genius alone, rush forward to
     sing of the highest subjects in the highest style, confess
     their folly and cease from such presumption; and if in
     their natural sluggishness they are but geese, let them
     abstain from imitating the eagle soaring to the stars.

	|8.  mente che scrivesti~: Latent is the metaphor of a
Book of Memory, a figure that controls the whole form of the
^Vita nuova~ after it is presented there in the opening words
(see C. S.  Singleton, 1949, pp. 25-54).  This metaphor will be
used more than once in the ^Commedia.~  See ^Par.~ XXIII, 54,
where memory is called the "libro che 'l preterito rassegna."  By
virtue of this same figure the poet also speaks of himself as
"scriba" (^Par.~ X, 27).  Here in the ^Inferno~, however, it is
"memory" itself that "wrote down" what the poet saw.

	|9.  la tua nobilitate~: See ^Conv.~ IV, xvi, 4: "Per
questo vocabulo `nobilitade' s'intende perfezione di propria
natura in ciascuna cosa."  ("This word `nobleness' means the
perfection in each thing of its proper nature.")

	|10.  Io cominciai...~: The prologue and invocation
completed, the canto's ^pars executiva --~as Dante terms it in his
^Letter to Can Grande (Epist.~ XIII, 43)-- begins with this verse.

	|12.  l'alto passo~: The "deep way" that lies ahead, the
"guerra del cammino" of vss. 4-5.  Note in "passo" the suggestion
of a "passing" or "crossing over" (into the world of the dead),
and a certain figurative correspondence with "lo passo che non
lasci@o gi@a mai persona viva" (^Inf.~ I, 26-27).

	|13.  Tu dici che di Silvio il parente~: The passing
touch of "Tu dici che" recognizes that Aeneas' journey to the
world of the dead as related in the ^Aeneid~ was poetic
fiction.  (For a similar touch, see ^Par.~ XV, 26: "se fede merta
nostra maggior musa," referring, of course, to Virgil's ^Aeneid.~
Also see ^Inf.~ XIII, 46-48.)  In contrast, no such "reservation"
is made when Paul's journey is mentioned (^Inf.~ II, 28:
"Andovvi").

	|Silvio~: Dante follows Virgil in making Silvius not
the son of Ascanius (Livy, I, iii, 6-7), but the late-born son of
Aeneas and Lavinia (^Aen.~ VI, 763-66):

     Silvius, Albanum nomen, tua postuma proles,
     quem tibi longaevo serum Lavinia coniunx
     educet silvis regem regumque parentem,
     unde genus Longa nostrum dominabitur Alba.

     Silvius of Alban name, thy last-born child, whom late
     in thy old age thy wife Lavinia shall bring up in the
     woodland, a king and father of kings; from him shall
     our race have sway in Long Alba.

According to Servius (on ^Aen.~ VI, 760), at the death of Aeneas,
Lavinia took refuge in the woods for fear of Ascanius (Aeneas'
son by Creusa) and there gave birth to Silvius.  Ascanius, the
founder of Alba Longa, eventually was succeeded by Silvius.

	|14.  corruttibile ancora~: Still mortal.

	|14-15.  ad immortale secolo~: Cf. the Latin ^saeculum~
in this sense.  "Mortale secolo" means "this world," of course.
"Immortale secolo" refers to "the otherworld," and is general
enough to include both Hades and Paradise.  It is possible that
Dante knew the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~, a very old and widely known
account of Heaven and Hell in which Paul is represented as going
to Hell.  Nevertheless, "immortal world" here in Canto II clearly
suggests Heaven as well as Hell: Paul went to the former, Aeneas
to the latter.  Dante would have expected his readers to remember
that Paul had been "caught up into paradise" (see n. to vs. 29);
moreover, the ^vi~ in "Andovvi" (vs. 28) indicates Paradise,
included in the "immortale secolo."  Paul's rapture will be
recalled again when Dante's own ascent to the heavenly Paradise
begins, and it is touched on in Dante's ^Letter to Can Grande
(Epist.~ XIII, 79)./ On the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~ and other
popular accounts of the otherworld known in the Middle Ages, see
T.  Silverstein (1937).

	|15.  sensibilmente~: In his bodily senses.

	|17.  i~ = ^gli.~

	|pensando~: The subject understood may be either "God" or "one"
in a kind of ablative absolute.  "If one considers the high effect..."
seems the more probable interpretation.

	|l'alto effetto~: As stated in vss. 20-24.

	|18.  e 'l chi e 'l quale~: Cf. the scholastic phrase
^quis et qualis./~ Aeneas was noble by birth, by character, and
by marriage.  See ^De mon.~ II, iii, 6: "Nam divinus poeta noster
Virgilius per totam Eneidem gloriosissimum regem Eneam patrem
Romani populi fuisse testatur in memoriam sempiternam."  ("For our
divine poet Virgil, throughout the ^Aeneid~ testifies, for an
everlasting memorial, that the glorious king Aeneas was the
father of the Roman people.") And Romulus, the legendary founder
of Rome, was descended from Aeneas (^Aen.~ VI, 777-79).  Some
interpreters would refer the phrase to the "alto effetto" (vs.
17) rather than to Aeneas, but this seems less satisfactory; the
focus here appears to be on Aeneas himself, as it continues to be
in vss. 20-21.  For yet another interpretation, see A. Pagliaro
(1961), pp. 190, 231-36, and Petrocchi's note.

	Petrocchi has followed Pagliaro in having no comma after
"quale"; however, many other editors have a comma there, and this
seems more in accord with the meaning that the translation has
rendered.

	|20.  e'~ = ^ei (egli).~

	|21.  l'empireo ciel~: The Empyrean heaven, the tenth and
outermost sphere, God's abode and "kingdom," as it is called in
^Inf.~ I, 127.  See ^Conv.~ II, iii, 8, 10:

     Veramente, fuori di tutti questi [cieli], li cattolici
     pongono lo cielo Empireo, che @e a dire cielo di fiamma
     o vero luminoso....E quieto e pacifico @e lo luogo di
     quella somma Deitade che sola [s@e] compiutamente
     vede.  Questo loco @e di spiriti beati, secondo che la Santa
     Chiesa vuole, che non pu~ dire menzogna.

     But beyond all these [heavens] the Catholics assert the
     empyrean heaven, which is as much as to say the heaven
     of flame, or the luminous heaven....But still and
     tranquil is the place of that supreme deity, which
     alone completely perceiveth itself.  This is the place of
     the blessed spirits, according as holy Church, which
     may not lie, will have it.

	|21.  eletto~: For Dante, the Roman Empire is directly
ordained by God as part of His providential plan for man's
redemption and was established in order to prepare the way for
the Advent of the Saviour and the foundation of His Church on
earth -- a conception that emerges time and again in the course of
the poem.  See C.S.  Singleton (1958), pp.  86-100.  Also see
F. Torraca (1925), who quotes several documents of Henry VII in
support of this idea, and N. Zingarelli (1927), pp. 91-94.

	|22-23.  la quale e 'l quale...fu stabilita~: "Roma e suo
impero" (vs. 20) are the antecedents.  A compound subject
governing a singular verb is common in Dante./ The reading
"stabilita" instead of "stabilito" seems preferable since it
singles out the first subject (Rome) as the "holy place." Thomas
Aquinas (^De reg. prin.~ I, 14) refers to Rome as the city "quam
Deus praeviderat christiani populi principalem sedem futuram"
("which God had foreseen as the chief abode of the Christians").
Also see ^Conv.~ IV, iv, 13: "E che ci@o sia, per due apertissime
ragioni vedere si pu@o, le quali mostrano quella civitade
imperatrice, e da Dio avere spezial nascimento, e da Dio avere
spezial processo."  ("And that this is so may be seen by two most
manifest reasons, which show that this city [of Rome] was
imperial, and had special birth and special progress from God.")

	|24.  u'~ = ^ubi (ove).~

	|maggior Piero~: Probably no comparison is intended here; the
adjective may simply mean "great" (see M. Barbi, 1934b, p. 237).
Possibly, however, some comparison might be implied in the sense that
Peter is thus singled out as the first and greatest of the popes.  See
^Par.~ XXXII, 136, where Adam is styled the "maggior padre di
famiglia."

	|25.  onde li dai tu vanto~: Again, the particular turn
of phrase implies that Aeneas' journey was poetic fiction.  See
n. to vs. 13.

	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|27.  di sua vittoria e del papale ammanto~: Aeneas'
victory led to the establishment of the Roman Empire, which was,
in turn, a preparation for the establishment of the Church -- the
"alto effetto" (vs. 17) that was to come of Aeneas' journey.  See
n.  to vs. 21.

	|28.  Andovvi~ = ^vi and@o~, i.e., "ad immortale secolo,"
which is Heaven in this case (see n. to vss. 14-15).

	|lo Vas~ ^d'elezione~: Paul.  See Actus 9: 15: "Dixit autem ad
eum Dominus: Vade, quoniam vas electionis est mihi iste, ut portet
nomen meum coram Gentibus et regibus et filiis Israel." ("But the Lord
said to him, 'Go, for this man is a chosen vessel to me, to carry my
name among nations and kings and the children of Israel.'")

	|29.  per recarne conforto a quella fede~: Paul, "caught
up into paradise," saw by direct vision (II Cor. 12:2-4), not
^per speculum~, as faith must see in this life.  His was a seeing
that transcended faith, and the report of it is a "conforto" to
faith.

	|30.  principio a la via di salvazione~: See Heb. 11:6:
"Sine fide autem impossibile est placere Deo."  ("Without faith it
is impossible to please God.")  See also Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ II-II, q. 2, a. 3, resp.: "Ad hoc quod homo perveniat ad
perfectam visionem beatitudinis, praeexigitur quod credat Deo,
tamquam discipulus magistro docenti." ("In order that a man
arrive at the perfect vision of heavenly happiness, he must first
of all believe God, as a disciple believes the master who is
teaching him.")

	|31-33.  io...io...io...~: In Italian, the subject
pronoun is always emphatic, and it becomes the more so here by
its repetition.

	|31.  venirvi~: The ^vi~ continues to refer to the
"immortale secolo" (vss. 14-15), including both Heaven and Hell,
but the shift from the "going" of Aeneas and Paul ("andata," vs.
25) to the "coming" of Dante ("venuta," vs. 35) brings in Virgil
and his point of view.  This shift is sustained throughout the
rest of the canto.

	|32.  Enea...Paulo~: Aeneas at the start of his journey
to Hades also names two who had been there (^Aen.~ VI, 12223):
"Quid Thesea magnum, / quid memorem Alciden?"  ("Why speak of
great Theseus, why of Alcides?")

	|33.  n$e altri 'l crede~: Neither Vandelli nor Casella
has the pleonastic pronoun "'l" (=^il~).  Petrocchi argues
convincingly for its inclusion in the verse; see his note.

	|34.  se del venire io m'abbandono~: "If I allow myself
to come."

	|35.  folle~: "Folly" -- with the touch of a suggestion
that for him to undertake such a journey would be an act of
^hubris.~

	|36.  me'~ = ^meglio.~

	|37-40.  E qual...tal mi fec' io~: Again, a pseudo-simile
(see n. to ^Inf.~ I, 55-60).

	|38.  cangia~ = ^cambia.~i

	|proposta~ = ^proposito~ (cf."proposto," vs. 138).

	|39.  tolle~ = ^toglie~ (from Latin ^tollere~).  The
meaning here is "si distoglie."

	|40.  oscura costa~: Like "piaggia" (see n. to ^Inf.~ I,
vs. 29), "costa" can mean either "shore" or "slope," or, as here,
it may have both meanings.  It is dark because night has fallen,
but it is dark also in a moral sense, as the "piaggia" is
"diserta" in both a physical and a moral sense.

	|41.  la 'mpresa~ = ^la impresa.~

	|44.  del magnanimo quell' ombra~: Virgil might be so
named in any case, but "magnanimo" here, with "viltade" (vs. 45)
applied to the wayfarer, suggests a struggle between magnanimity
and pusillanimity.  See ^Conv.~ IV, xxvi, 7, 9:

     Questo sprone si chiama Fortezza, o vero Magnanimi-
     tate....Quanto spronare fu quello, quando esso Enea
     sostenette solo con Sibilla a intrare ne lo Inferno a
     cercare de l'anima di suo padre Anchise, contra tanti
     pericoli.

     This spur is called courage, or consciousness of great-
     ness....How great spurring was that when the same
     Aeneas hardened himself to enter alone with the Sibyl
     into hell and search for the soul of his father Anchises,
     in the face of so many perils.

Virgil's ^exhortatio~ to Dante as they stand before the gate of
Hell will be a direct reminiscence of this passage in the
^Aeneid.~  See ^Inf.~ III, 14-15 and the note.

	|46.  fiate~ = ^volte~, of frequent occurrence in Dante.

	|47.  onrata~ = ^onorata.~

	|48.  quand' ombra~ = ^quando s'adombra.~

	|49.  solve~ = ^solva~, present subjunctive of ^solversi.~

	|50.  io 'ntesi~ = ^io intesi.~

	|51.  dolve~ = ^dolse~, archaic past absolute of ^dolere~
in an impersonal construction, "it grieved me for you."

	|52.  sospesi~: Literally, "suspended."  The meaning will
become clear when the reader learns more (see ^Inf.~ 1V, 28-42)
about the condition of those in Limbo, of Virgil and the other
virtuous pagans whose punishment it is to live in desire but
without hope.  The adjective "sospesi" (both here and again in
^Inf.~ IV, 45) indicates not only this spiritual condition, but
also the actual physical position of Limbo; outside of Hell
proper, it nevertheless is counted as the first circle.

	|55.  Lucevan li occhi suoi pi@u che la stella~: See
^Vita nuova~ XXIII, 25 and ^Conv.~ III, ix, 11-12.

	|la stella~:  Singular for the plural, as elsewhere in Dante.

	|56.  a dir soave e piana~: Both adjectives function here
as adverbs modifying "dir."  See M. Barbi (1934b), p. 203.

	|57.  in sua favella~: "In her speech" or mode of
speaking (as E. G.  Parodi, 1957, p. 338, explains).

	|58-60.  O anima...lontana~: Beatrice's words to Virgil
have a rhetorical amplitude and formal development that follow
recognized models, with an exordium in the manner of a ^captatio
benevolentiae~ ("gaining the good will (of another]").  We may
note here the first of the many appeals in the ^Inferno~ to
enduring fame in the world of the living -- a survival after death
that is desired by many of the damned of Hell, as if it were
their only "immortality."

	|61.  l'amico mio, e non de la ventura~: "Ventura" is
synonymous with "Fortuna" and, accordingly, bears in this context
some suggestion of a personification, as if two ladies, Beatrice
and Lady Fortune, were contending for this man's affections.
Behind the term "amico," in this context, lies the current phrase
"nemica Fortuna" as well as "nemico della Fortuna." / See
Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ III, 9 (vol. I, p. 254, ll.  17-18):
"Madonna, el mi pare che voi siate delle nemiche della fortuna
come sono io" ("My lady, it appears to me that you are one of
Fortune's enemies, as I am"); VIII, 7 (vol. II, p. 149, l. 36):
"Ma anche questo l'aveva la sua nemica fortuna tolto" ("But this,
too, her enemy Fortune had taken from her").  See also X, 8 (vol.
II, p. 285, l. II): "amato dalla fortuna" ("beloved of
Fortune").(See Plate 1.)

	|62.  la diserta piaggia~: The "gran diserto" and the
"loco selvaggio" of ^Inf.~  I (vss. 64 and 93).  See also "la
piaggia diserta," ^Inf.~ I, 29.  In support of the meaning
"shore" for "piaggia" here in ^Inf.~ 11, 62, a metaphorical
"fiumana" will appear in vs. 108.

	|63.  v@olt' @e = @e volto.     paura~: In fact,
throughout the preceding account of this same scene, fear (see
^Inf.~ I, vss. 6, 15, 19, 44, 53, 90) was stressed as the chief
obstacle to the ascent of the mountain.  Now fear is explicitly
said to be what caused the wayfarer finally to turn back.
Virgil's question to Beatrice (^Inf.~ II, 82-84) will continue to
underline fear.

	|64.  smarrito~: The word echoes "smarrita" (^Inf.~ I, 3)
and suggests that the wayfarer may be in danger of again losing
the "diritta via," as indeed he is in his "ruining down to the
depth" (^Inf.~ I, 61).

	|68.  mestieri~ = ^mestiere.~

	|70.  I' son Beatrice~: Virgil had referred to Beatrice
in vss. 122-23 of the preceding canto as a soul worthier than he
to take over as guide and lead the wayfarer to Paradise, but he
did not explicitly name her.  Now Virgil tells how she descended
to Limbo and declared herself to him.  But we may well wonder how
Virgil, who died in 19 B.C., could be expected to recognize
Beatrice, and his immediate recognition of her takes on a greater
interest.  See n. to vss. 76-78.

	|72.  amor mi mosse~: As is evident from Beatrice's whole
account of the prologue action in Heaven, the love she speaks of
is a love ^de sursum descendens~ ("descending from on high"), the
blessed Virgin Mary's love and, in the last analysis, God's love.
Beatrice in the ^Commedia~ is no Pre-Raphaelite "Blessed
Damozel."

	|76-78.  O donna di virt@u...li cerchi sui~: These words
of recognition to Beatrice are most important as a first focus on
her allegorical meaning.  See C. S. Singleton (1956)./ Some
editors place a comma after "virt@u"; and since "donna" is the
antecedent of "cui," this seems preferable.

	|78.  sui~ = ^suoi.~

	|81.  @e uo'~ = ^@e uopo~ (cf.  Latin ^opus est~).  For a
justification of this reading see Petrocchi's note.

	|82.  la cagion che~ = ^la cagione per la quale.~

	|83.  in questo centro~: In this context the phrase bears
a strong pejorative connotation, which stems from the
well-established view that the earth's position at the center of
the universe is the most ignoble -- because it is farthest from God
and His angels.  The cavity of Hell is, of course, even farther
from the "ampio loco" (vs. 84) of the Empyrean heaven.  See Fra
Giordano da Rivalto, ^Prediche~ VI (1739 edn., p. 22):

     La terra...@e il centro di questo mondo; imperoc-
     ch'ella @e nel mezzo di tutti i cieli, e di tutti gli elementi.
     Ma il diritto centro si @e appunto quel miluogo della
     terra dentro, ch'@e in mezzo della terra, come la granella
     @e in mezzo del pome.  Quello @e il diritto centro, ove noi
     crediamo, che sia il ninferno.

     The earth...is the center of this world, for it is in
     the midst of all the heavens and of all the elements.
     But the true center is precisely that point within the
     earth which is in its midst, as the core is in the midst
     of the apple.  We believe that Hell is located there, at
     the true center.

	|84.  l'ampio loco~: The Empyrean heaven, the outermost
sphere, which contains the whole universe.  It is a spiritual
heaven where the saints abide with God.

	|ardi~: Latent in the verb is the metaphor of fire or a flame
which, in Dante's physics as in Aristotle's, seeks ever to rise to its
"proper" place, i.e., the sphere of fire, the highest of the elemental
spheres, as to its resting place.  So Beatrice "burns" to return to her
"proper" place.(See Figs. 1 and 2.)

	|85.  saver~ = ^sapere.~

	|86.  dirotti~ = ^ti dir@o.~

	|88.  dee~ = ^deve.~

	|89.  altrui~: A dative here, although it should be noted
that ^altrui~, invariable in form, also can be accusative or
possessive, according to the context.

	|91-93.  I' son fatta...non m'assale~: This lack of
compassion toward the damned in Limbo and Hell is the
characteristic attitude shown by the saints in Paradise.  As
Thomas Aquinas summarizes it (^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 94,
a. 2, resp.): "Et ideo beati qui erunt in gloria nullam
compassionem ad damnatos habebunt."  ("Therefore the blessed in
glory will have no pity on the damned.")  On this matter of the
saints' immunity to compassion, see C. H.  Grandgent (1926).

	|92.  la vostra miseria~: Readers of this translation,
which does not use the second person singular "thou" but only
"you," except when the Deity is addressed, should remark the
shifts from singular to plural that take place in the original
Italian.  In making the shift here, Beatrice refers to the misery
of all the damned of Hell.  ^tange~: See Sapien. 3:1: "Iustorum
autem animae in manu Dei sunt, et non tanget illos tormentum
mortis."  ("But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and
the torment of death shall not touch them.")

	|93. n$e fiamma d'esto 'ncendio non m'assale~: Fire
stands for all the torments of Hell, even though it actually
proves to be the instrument of punishment in only two of the
several circles (the seventh and the eighth).  Among the many
Biblical references to the fire of Hell, see especially Ecclus.
28:25-27:

     Mors illius mors nequissima, et utilis potius infernus
     quam illa.  Perseverantia illius non permanebit, sed
     obtinebit vias iniustorum, et in flamma sua non com-
     buret iustos; qui relinquunt Deum incident in illam,
     et exardebit in illis et non extinguetur, et immittetur
     in illos quasi leo, et quasi pardus laedet illos.

     The death [inflicted by an evil tongue] is a most evil
     death: and hell is preferable to it.  Its continuance shall
     not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of
     the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its
     flame.  They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it
     shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it
     shall be sent upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it
     shall tear them.

	|93.  d'esto 'ncendio~ = ^d'esto incendio.~

	|94-96.  Donna @e gentil nel ciel...l@a s@u frange~: As
is made clear later (but may well be taken for granted), the
blessed Virgin Mary is "our advocate" in Heaven.  Her
intercession, in fact, makes this journey to God possible --"stern
judgment is broken thereabove."  The sinner otherwise would have
remained in the darkness of sin and finally have been swept down
to the "second death" of Hell.  Dante's own great devotion to the
Virgin Mary is evident throughout the poem.  How the Divine Will
may be affected or changed by love is described in ^Par.~ XX,
94-99.  See also, in the prayer addressed to Mary at the end of
the poem (^Par.~ XXXIII, 16-18), what may be applied to her
intercession here at the beginning:

     La tua benignit@a non pur soccorre
     a chi domanda, ma molte fiate
     liberamente al dimandar precorre.

	|97-102.  Questa chiese Lucia...l'antica Rachele~: No
reader will miss the courtly atmosphere of this prologue scene in
Heaven, the gracious manner in which one "lady" turns or comes to
another, with due observance of station and degree.  Indeed, this
is the court of the "Emperor who reigns thereabove," to whom
Virgil referred (^Inf.~ I, 124).

	|97.  Lucia~: This doubtless is St.  Lucy of Syracuse,
the third-century virgin martyr regarded as patron saint of those
who suffer from eye ailments.  Early commentators consider her as
the symbol of illuminating grace.  The meaning of Lucy's role in
this first relay of grace will become clearer as the poem
unfolds.

	|98.  il tuo fedele~: There were two churches in Florence
dedicated to St.  Lucy of Syracuse.  Commentators frequently
point out that Dante may have placed himself under Lucy's
protection while he was suffering from a temporary eye affliction
(^Vita nuova~ XXXIX, 4; ^Conv.~ III, ix, 14-16).  This can hardly
be intended as any part of the meaning here, however, where
seeing is a matter, above all, of an inner light.

	|100.  nimica di ciascun crudele~: The phrase is similar
to "l'avversario d'ogne male" in vs. 16.  "Crudele" is an adjective
used substantively, and the meaning is "all who are cruel."

	|101.  si mosse~: Mary does not leave her seat, as Lucy
does; a higher and a lower rank thereby are implied.

	|102.  con l'antica Rachele~: Beatrice has her seat in
Heaven beside Rachel, as the poem states both here and again at
the end (see ^Par.~ XXXII, 89)./ Rachel, according to the
account in Genesis was the younger sister of Leah.  Jacob first
married Leah, and then finally won Rachel.

	|103.  loda di Dio vera~: See ^Vita nuova~ XXVI, where
Dante recounts that all who watched Beatrice pass along the way
praised God for her.  In her earthly life, and now in her
heavenly life, Beatrice is such a wondrous being that she is a
living praise of the Creator.

	|104.  ch$e~ = ^perch$e.~

	|105.  ch'usc@i per te de la volgare schiera~: A familiar
tenet of the doctrine of courtly love is expressed here: by his
love for his lady the poet is lifted above the vulgar.  The past
tense points back to the experience described in the ^Vita~
^nuova~, where Beatrice appears not as a disembodied allegory but
as a real lady, as here.

	|107.  la morte~: Spiritual death, primarily, but also
physical death (see ^Purg.~ I, 58-60)./ What is seen here from
Heaven connects with the first simile of the poem (^Inf.~ I, 22-
27).

	|108.  su la fiumana ove 'l mar non ha vanto~: This river
or "flood" is essentially the same water as the "pelago" of
^Inf.~ I, 22-27.  It is not a river that flows into the sea;
hence, the sea rightly can be said to have no vaunt over it.  On
the imagery and meaning of this verse, see C. S.  Singleton
(1948).

	|109.  fur~ = ^furono.~

	|ratte~ = ^rapide.~

	|111.  cotai~ = ^cotali.~i

	|fatte~: The verb ^fare~ often replaces the more specific 
verb ^dire.~

	|116.  li occhi lucenti lagrimando volse~: Beatrice turns
her tearful eyes to Virgil (not toward Heaven, as some
commentators understand).  ^Volgere~ often is used to signify a
turning of the attention rather than a bodily movement.  Beatrice
was looking at Virgil before, as she spoke to him; it is only now
that her eyes fill with tears, as she continues to face toward
him and urges him to proceed to the rescue of the wayfarer on the
dark slope.  It is this that makes Virgil more eager to do her
command.

	|118.  volse~ = ^volle~, past absolute of ^volere.~

	|119.  quella fiera~: The she-wolf, the most troublesome
of the three beasts and the one that was causing the wayfarer
finally to ruin back into the darkness of sin.

	|120.  il corto andar~: The phrase clearly implies that
there is a longer way up the mountain.  What that longer path is
the poem will make clear in due course.

	|121.  restai~ = ^ristai.~ "Why do you stay" or "Why do you
hold back" from entering upon this journey? ^Restare~ frequently
means "to stay" or "to leave off."

	|122.  allette~ = ^alletti.~

	|124.  tai~ = ^tali.~  Cf."cotai," vs. III.

	|126.  'l mio parlar~: All that Virgil had said (^Inf.~
I, 112-20).

	|ben~: Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 8.

	|135.  porse~: Past absolute of ^porgere~ (literally, "to
proffer").

	|138.  proposto~ = ^proposito.~  Cf. "proposta," vs. 38.

	|141.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|fue~ = ^fu.~

	|142.  cammino alto e silvestro~: "Alto" echoes what was
said of the way or crossing to the otherworld ("alto passo,"
^Inf.~ II, 12), while the adjective "silvestro" clearly connects
with "selva" in "selva oscura" of the poem's opening verses
(^Inf.~ I, 2).  Thus, Virgil leads the wayfarer from the desert
strand of this prologue scene into the way through Hell.  This
way will be described as savage, "silvestro" (^Inf.~ XXI, 84).  In
metaphor, then, the savage way ("cammino silvestro") of Hell
corresponds to the dark wood ("selva oscura") of the sinful life.
The journey beyond always remains potentially our journey here.
Not only through metaphor, but primarily through allegory this
transition is achieved, so that in the dimension of the literal
journey through Hell the dimension of our own journey in "our
life" is constantly recalled and developed.
