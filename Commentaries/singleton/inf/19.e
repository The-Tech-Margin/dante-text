	|1.  Simon mago~: In the Bible, Simon Magus was a
sorcerer of Samaria who was converted by the preaching of Philip
the evangelist (see Actus 8:9-13).  When he subsequently
attempted to buy the power of conferring the Holy Ghost, he was
severely rebuked by the apostle Peter for thinking that the gift
of God might be purchased with money (see Actus 8:14-24).  From
the name Simon is derived the word "simony," which is applied to
all traffic in sacred things, especially the buying or selling of
ecclesiastical offices; those guilty of the offense are termed
"simonists" or "simoniacs."

	|miseri seguaci~: The simonists.

	|2.  le cose di Dio~: Spiritual goods and offices.

	|2-3.  di bontate deon essere spose~: "Should be married
to goodness," i.e., should be assigned to the good and righteous.

	|3.  deon~ = ^devono.~

	|3.  e voi rapaci~: The "voi" singles out present
practitioners of simony, the followers of Simon contemporary to
Dante.

	|4.  avolterate~: Archaic, "adulterate."

	|5.  per voi suoni la tromba~: "Proclaim judgment upon
you."  Town criers sounded a trumpet to announce their reading of
judicial sentences in public; the word here may also suggest the
sounding of the angel's trumpet on the Day of Judgment./ "Tromba"
probably should be considered the subject of "suoni," although
^io~ (understood) might be the subject and "tromba" the object.

	|7-8.  Gi@a eravamo, a la seguente tomba, montati~: Those
who advocate this punctuation take "tomba" as the ditch ("fosso,"
vs. 9) in which the simonists are "buried"; see, for example, M.
Barbi (1934b), p. 241.  Other interpreters, however, have
understood "tomba" to mean the bridge itself; see F. D'Ovidio
(1907), pp. 342-45.

	|9.  sovra mezzo 'l fosso~ = ^sovra il mezzo del fosso.~

	|10-12.  O somma sapienza...comparte~: On this tercet and
the "art" and "justice" here exclaimed over, see C. S. Singleton
(1954), pp. 29-30.

	|11.  in cielo~: "in the heavens"; not "in Heaven."

	|12.  giusto~: The adjective is used for the
adverb.

	|comparte~: "Metes out" or "apportions" the punishments of
Hell.

	|14.  livida~: The color that was called "ferrigno" (see
^Inf.~ XVIII, 2) in the general description of the eighth circle.

	|15.  d'un largo~ = ^di una larghezza.~  Thus there is a
certain calculated regularity in the architecture here, which the
simile of the Florentine Baptistery (vs. 17) emphasizes.

	|17.  nel mio bel San Giovanni~: The famous Baptistery of
Florence, in which Dante, like most Florentine children of his
time, was baptized; see ^Par.~ XXV, 8-9.  John the Baptist is the
patron saint of Florence; see ^Inf.~ XIII, 143-44.  The present
Baptistery, octagonal in form, was in Dante's time the cathedral
of Florence.  (The present cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, was
begun in 1296 from plans of Arnolfo di Cambio and was not
completed until the middle of the fifteenth century.)  The
Baptistery dates back to at least the sixth century, although its
precise date is still the subject of controversy.  It may have
been erected on the site of an ancient temple of Mars, the
original patron of Florence; see ^Inf.~ XIII, 144 and n. to
^Inf.~ XIII, 143-50.

	|18.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|21.  e questo sia suggel ch' ogn' omo sganni~: G.
Vandelli (1935, p. 117) asserts that the verse is designed to
induce those who interpreted the story of Dante's breaking the
baptismal font in San Giovanni's differently from the way Dante
does (i.e., as an act of sacrilege) to change their minds./ He
points (pp. 119-20) to two examples of ^suggello~ used in the
same sense it has in this verse, namely, "dichiarazione scritta,
debitamente munita di ^suggelli"~ ("written declaration, duly
furnished with ^suggelli~ [seals]").

	|22.  soperchiava~: The subject is plural: "piedi" and
"gambe."

	|24.  grosso~: The "calf" of the leg (though Porena
prefers to understand "thigh").

	|26.  giunte~ = ^giuntura.~  If "grosso" (vs. 24) is taken
to mean the calf, then "giunte" refers especially to the ankles;
however, the knees might be wriggling too without actually being
visible.

	|27.  averien~ = ^avrebbero.~

	|ritorte e strambe~:  Giovanni Battista Gelli (^Letture~ VII,
9; see p. 172) defines ^ritorte~ as "quei legamenti de' rami d'arbori
attorti, con che i villani legono le fastella della stipa" ("those
bands made of twisted branches of trees, with which the peasants tie
their bundles of brushwood") and ^strambe~ as "quelle fune fatte d'erbe
secche e nervose, con le quali vengon legate le cuoia di verso la
Barberia" ("those ropes made of dry and sinewy grass, used over in
Barbary to tie up bundles of leather").

	|29.  strema~ = ^estrema.~

	|buccia~: Literally, "rind."

	|30.  punte~: The toes, possibly the tips of the toes.

	|31.  Chi @e colui~: Dante's opening words are similar to
those which singled out Capaneus (^Inf.~ XIV, 46): "chi @e quel
grande...."

	|che si cruccia~: "Who shows his pain" by writhing.

	|33.  e cui pi@u roggia fiam ma succia~: The phrase may
suggest the way in which physical magnitude repeatedly is used to
signify moral stature (see ^Inf.~ X, 52-54 and the note; ^Inf.~
XIII, 32 and the note).  But here there is a striking difference:
it is not greater physical size but more intense punishment that
singles out this sinner: the punishing flame is redder on his
feet.

	|cui~: Accusative here.

	|succia~ = ^succhia~, "sucks," as a flame draws up oil through
a wick.

	|35.  quella ripa che pi@u giace~: As will be seen later
(Inf. XXIV, 34-40), the whole field of the eighth circle slopes
toward the pit at the center.  If the floors of the ^bolge~ are
fairly level (as seems to be the case), then the inner bank of
each will be shorter than the outer, and will "slope less," will
"have a more gradual slope." (See Fig. 6b, p. 312.)

	|37.  m'@e bel~: "Is gratifying to me"; see ^Purg.~ XXVI,
140.

	|39.  quel che si tace~: Virgil can read Dante's thoughts
and thereby divine his wishes.

	|40.  in su l'argine quarto~: The fourth embankment,
dividing the third ^bolgia~ from the fourth.

	|41.  a mano stanca~ = ^a mano sinistra.~  The phrase
modifies "volgemmo" and "discendemmo."

	|42.  nel fondo foracchiato e arto~: The bottom is
"narrow" (cf. the Latin ^artus~) in the sense that the many
holes leave only a narrow passageway between.

	|44.  non mi dipuose, s@i...~: A common construction in
early Italian; see vss. 127-28.

	|dipuose~ = ^depose.~

	|mi~ giunse~: "Brought me up to."

	|rotto~: "Crevice," the "hole" into which the sinner is thrust
head down.

	|45.  che si piangeva~: Some editors prefer "s@i
piangeva," which in the present context would make perfectly good
sense; "si" without the accent, on the other hand, could be the
familiar pleonastic reflexive, which sets off or frames the
subject (see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94).

	|zanca~: The term, like "shank" in English, is not necessarily
derisive and its use is not comparable to the use of "zucca" for "head"
in the Preceding canto (see ^Inf.~ XVIII, 124).  This is borne out by
the fact that "zanche" later is used to refer to Virgil's legs (^Inf.~
XXXIV, 79).

	|46-47.  O qual che se'...commessa~: The opening phrase
immediately reduces the sinner to the status of uncertain
identity, to a "thing" with its upper side turned down, an object
comparable to a stake thrust in a hole (as vs. 47 clearly
implies).

	|47.  come pal commessa~: See "piantato," vs. 81.  The
simile anticipates that of vss. 49-51, and refers to a horrible
punishment known as ^propagginazione~, literally, "the planting
of grapevines," by which assassins were stuck head downward in a
hole, the hole was filled with dirt, and the criminal choked to
death.  Scartazzini (3rd edn.), commenting on vs. 49, quotes an
old decree of Florence which refers to such punishment:
"Assassinus...plantetur capite deorsum, ita quod moriatur."  ("Let
the assassin...be planted with his head down, so that he will
die.")

	|48.  se puoi, fa motto~: The challenge continues the
derisive focus on this upside-down "thing."  Can it speak or not?

	|49-51.  to stava come 'l frate...cessa~: On the
punishment of assassins (here alluded to in the sense of hired
murderers) and the calling back of the confessor, Benvenuto
comments:

     Aliquando contingit...quod unus pessimus sicarius
     damnatus...ad plantationem corporis, postquam est positus in
     fossa cum capite deorsum, revocat confessorem suum ut
     confiteatur sibi aliquid peccatum, et dicat sibi aliquid de
     novo.  Tunc confessor necessario inclinat aurem suam ad
     terram et attente auscultat illum.

     Sometimes it happens...that a wicked murderer, who has been
     condemned...to be planted with his head down, will, after he
     has been placed in the ditch head first, call back his
     confessor to confess some further sin.  At such times, the
     confessor necessarily bends his ear toward the earth, and
     attentively listens to him.

	|51.  cessa~: "Delays."  Here ^cessare~ is a transitive
verb, having "morte" as object.

	|52.  cost@i~: "Up there"; the word refers to the
position of the person spoken to.  The speaker, as we learn in
vss. 69-70 (though not explicitly), is Pope Nicholas III; see n.
to vs.  69.  He thinks he is addressing Pope Boniface VIII; see
n.  to vss. 53-57.

	|ritto~: "Standing," as if to say, "as I am not and as you
shall not be for long."  The word is repeated (vs.  53) with telling
emphasis.

	|53-57.  Bonifazio...farne strazio~: Boniface VIII
(Benedetto Caetani), born at Anagni ^ca.~ 1235, was created
cardinal by Martin IV in 1281; elected pope at Naples in
succession to Celestine V on December 24, 1294; and crowned at
Rome on January 23, 1295.  He died at Rome, October 11, 1303.
Since Boniface died three years after the assumed date of Dante's
journey through Hell, the poet by anticipation has assigned
Boniface his place among the simonists.  He has been referred to
before (see ^Inf.~ VI, 69; ^Inf.~ XV, 112-14) and will be the
object of many another bitter denunciation in the poem.  Villani
(who as a Guelph might have been expected to support the Church)
says of him (VIII, 6, 64):

     Pecunioso fu molto per aggrandire la Chiesa e' suoi parenti,
     non faccendo coscienza di guadagno, che tutto dicea gli era
     licito quello ch'era della Chiesa....Fece al suo tempo pi@u
     cardinali suoi amici e confidenti, intra gli altri due suoi
     nipoti molto giovani, e uno suo zio fratello che fu della
     madre, e venti tra vescovi e arcivescovi suoi parenti e
     amici della piccola citt@a d'Anagna di ricchi vescovadi, e
     l'altro suo nipote e figliuoli, ch'erano conti...lasci@o
     loro quasi infinito tesoro.

     By aggrandizing the church and his relatives, he became very
     rich; nor did he have any scruples about making profits, for
     he said that everything that belonged to the church was
     lawfully his....In his time he created several cardinals
     from among his friends and confidants, among them two very
     young nephews of his, and an uncle who was his mother's
     brother.  He also created twenty bishops and archbishops
     from among his relatives and friends in the small city of
     Anagni, giving them rich dioceses; and, to his other nephew
     and to his sons, who were counts...he left an almost
     infinite fortune.

On the charge that Boniface was elected pope by fraud (seized "by
guile the beautiful lady," vss. 56-57), and on Boniface's
relations with his predecessor, Pope Celestine V, see n. to
^Inf.~ III, 59-60, especially the passage from the ^Cronica
fiorentina~ there cited.  See also Villani (VIII, 6):

     Nel detto anno 1294, messer Benedetto Guatani
     cardinale, avendo per suo senno e sagacit@a adoperato
     che papa Celestino avea rifiutato il papato...segu@i la sua
     impresa, e tanto adoper@o co' cardinali e col procaccio
     del re Carlo, il quale avea l'amist@a di molti cardinali,
     spezialmente de' dodici nuovi eletti per Celestino, e stando
     in questa cerca, una sera di notte isconosciuto con poca
     compagnia and@o al re Carlo, e dissegli: "Re, il tuo papa
     Celestino t'ha voluto e potuto servire nella tua guerra di
     Cicilia, ma non ha saputo; ma se tu adoperi co' tuoi amici
     cardinali che io sia eletto papa, io sapr@o, e vorr@o, e
     potr@o"; promettendogli per sua fede e saramento di mettervi
     tutto il podere della Chiesa.  Allora lo re fidandosi di
     lui, gli promise e ordin@o co' suoi dodici cardinali che gli
     dessero le loro boci...e per questo modo fu eletto papa
     nella citt@a di Napoli, la vilia della nativit@a di Cristo
     del detto anno.

     In that year 1294, Messer Benedetto Caetani, the cardinal,
     having shrewdly and sagaciously induced Pope Celestine to
     renounce the papacy...pursued his plan.  He skillfully won
     over the cardinals, and the support of King Charles, who
     enjoyed the friendship of many cardinals, especially of the
     twelve newly elected by Celestine.  One night, in pursuit of
     his goal, he secretly went with but a few companions to King
     Charles and said to him: "King, your Pope Celestine wanted
     to serve you and could have served you in your war in
     Sicily, but he did not know how.  If you influence your
     friends and cardinals to elect me pope I shall know how, I
     am willing, and I will be able to."  And he promised him by
     his faith and by the sacrament that he would bring all the
     power of the church to bear on that war.  The king believed
     him, made him the promise, and arranged to have his twelve
     cardinals give him their vote...and thus was he elected
     pope, in the city of Naples, on the eve of Christmas in the
     said year.

	|54.  Di parecchi anni mi ment@i lo scritto~: "The
writing [i.e., the 'Book of the Future'] lied to me by several
years."  The speaker, like all souls in Hell, can dimly see
things in the future (see n. to ^Inf.~ X, 100-105).  He thinks he
is speaking to Boniface, not Dante; but he has "read" in the
"Book of the Future" that Boniface will die in 1303 and
accordingly does not yet expect him.  Hence his surprise.

	|56.  a 'nganno~ = ^a inganno.~  The reference may be both
to Boniface's deceit of Celestine and to Boniface's fraudulent
election as pope.

	|57.  la bella donna~: The Church, Bride of Christ and of
His Vicar on earth (see "suo marito," vs. III).  See Eph.  5:25-
27:

     Viri, diligite uxores vestras, sicut et Christus dilexit
     ecclesiam, et seipsum tradidit pro ea, ut illam
     sanctificaret, mundans lavacro aquae in verbo vitae, ut
     exhiberet ipse sibi gloriosam ecclesiam, non habentem
     maculam aut rugam aut aliquid huiusmodi, sed ut sit sancta
     et immaculata.

     Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
     Church, and delivered himself up for her, that he might
     sanctify her, cleansing her in the bath of water by means of
     the word; in order that he might present to himself the
     Church in all her glory, not having spot or wrinkle or any
     such thing, but that she might be holy and with  out
     blemish.

	|57.  di farne strazio~: "To do her outrage" by
practicing simony.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ (n. to vs. 52)
comments: "Nullo maggiore strazio puote uomo fare della sua
donna, ch'egli ha sposata, che sottometterla per moneta a chi
pi@u ne d@a."  ("A man can do no greater outrage to the woman he
has married than to subject her for money to whoever pays the
most.")

	|62.  Non son colui, non son colui~: This repeated reply
corresponds to Nicholas' repeated question in vss. 52-53 ("Se' tu
gi@a...se' tu gi@a") and represents a kind of tit for tat.

	|64.  tutti storse i piedi~: "Tutti" has the value of
"both" (adjective) and "all over" (adverb).  Nicholas is writhing
his feet in extreme vexation over having so needlessly revealed
his identity by his "sudden question" (see vs. 78).

	|65.  pianto~: "Weeping" because of rage, more than
anything else.

	|67.  ch'i' sia~ = ^chi io sia.~

	|ti cal~ = ^ti cale.~

	|68.  che tu abbi per@o la ripa corsa~: The shade of
Nicholas, "planted" head down as he is in his hole, has no way of
knowing this on his own.  The wayfarer may have said as much when
he "answered as [he] was bidden" (vs. 63).  Or perhaps he simply
said he was not among those doomed to this ^bolgia~ and Nicholas
concluded that he was passing by and came all the way "down the
bank" in order to satisfy his curiosity.

	|69.  sappi ch'i' fui vestito del gran manto~: The
speaker, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini), was a
nobleman of Rome.  He was created cardinal-deacon of San Nicola
in Carcere Tulliano by Innocent IV in 1244; and was elected pope
at Viterbo on November 25, 1277, in succession to John XXI, after
a vacancy in the Holy See of more than six months.  He died at
his castle near Viterbo on August 22, 1280.  The less than three
years of Nicholas' pontificate were marked by nepotism (see vs.
71 and the note) and intrigue.  On his nepotism, which led
naturally to simony, Villani elaborates (VII, 54):

     Poi che fu chiamato papa Niccola terzo, fu magnanimo, e per
     lo caldo de' suoi consorti imprese molte cose per fargli
     grandi, e fu de' primi o primo papa, nella cui corte
     s'usasse palese simonia per gli suoi parenti; per la qual
     cosa gli aggrand@i molto di possessioni e di castella e di
     moneta sopra tutti i Romani, in poco tempo ch'egli vivette.
     Questo papa fece sette cardinali romani, i pi@u suoi
     parenti....E tolse alla Chiesa castello Santangiolo, e
     diello a messer Orso suo nipote.  Ancora il detto papa
     fecesi privilegiare per la Chiesa la contea di Romagna e la
     citt@a di Bologna a Ridolfo re de' Romani....Incontanente
     che'l detto papa ebbe privilegio di Romagna, s@i ne fece
     conte per la Chiesa messer Bertoldo degli Orsini suo nipote,
     e con forza di cavalieri e di gente d'arme il mand@o in
     Romagna, e con lui per legato messer frate Latino di Roma
     cardinale ostiense suo nipote, figliuolo della suora....

     After he became Pope Nicholas III his magnanimity and his
     affection for his relatives caused him to do many things for
     their aggrandizement.  He was one of the first, if not the
     first pope at whose court simony was openly practiced for
     the benefit of relatives.  In the short time that he lived,
     he multiplied their possessions, their castles, and their
     money, so that they had more than all other Romans.  This
     pope created seven cardinals, most of them his
     relatives....He took away Castel Sant'Angelo from the Church
     and gave it to his nephew Messer Orso.  Furthermore, said
     pope made Rudolph king of the Romans invest him, on behalf
     of the Church, with the county of Romagna and the city of
     Bologna....As soon as the pope had Romagna, his nephew
     Bertoldo degli Orsini was made count thereof in the name of
     the Church.  The pope sent him to Romagna with knights and
     men at arms, and with him as legate Messer Frate Latino of
     Rome, the cardinal of Ostia, who was his nephew, the son of
     his sister.

On Nicholas' part in European intrigues of the time, see n. to
vss. 98-99.    ^del gran manto~: See "papale ammanto" (^Inf.~ II,
27) and "il gran manto" (^Purg.~ XIX, 104).

	|70.  figliuol de l'orsa~: The Orsini were commonly
referred to as ^filii ursae~; see I. Del Lungo (1898), p. 469.
H. Grundmann (1932, p. 252) notes that in the pseudo-Joachist
prophecy of the popes known as the ^Papalisto~ there is a
reference to the Orsini as "genus nequam ursa catulos pascens"
("that nefarious species the bear, feeding its young").  The bear
was known as a voracious animal, and the female was thought to be
particularly fierce in guarding her young.

	|71.  cupido s@i per avanzar ti orsatti~: A reference to
Nicholas' nepotism.

	|72.  che s@u l'avere e qui me misi in borsa~: The
^contrapasso~ aspect of the punishment is evident here.
Nicholas' words echo Peter's condemnation of Simon (Actus 8:20):
"Pecunia tua tecum sit in perditionem." ("Thy money go to
destruction with thee.")  The hole in which the sinner is thrust
is his "purse"; his "money" is there with him, and he is told to
guard it well (vs. 98).

	|73.  tratti~: Each sinner remains "planted with his feet
aglow" (vs. 81) until "thrust" lower by his successor.
Apparently this hole is reserved exclusively for popes.

	|75.  piatti~: A predicate adjective after "son" (vs.
73).  "Piatti" has something of the value of a past participle:
"flattened," "mashed."

	|76-81.  L@a gi@u cascher@o io...coi pi@e rossi~:
Nicholas, who died in 1280, has been in Hell twenty years and
will not be supplanted by Boniface, who died in 1303, until three
years hence.  Boniface, in turn, will wait nearly eleven years to
be replaced by the next pope (Clement V; see n. to vs. 83), who
died in 1314.  However, Nicholas' prediction cannot be taken as
incontrovertible evidence that the present canto was composed
after 1314, although G. Petrocchi (1957, pp.  660-61) has
proposed that after 1314 Dante was able to retouch these verses
and thus safely to "predict" the death of the Gascon pope.

	|78.  'l s@ubito dimando~: Which he has already regretted
(see vss. 64-65).

	|dimando~ = ^dimanda~; for this form see ^Inf.~ II, 97.

	|79-80.  Ma pi@u @e 'l tempo...~^sottosopra~: See n. to
vss. 76-81.

	|83.  ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|un pastor sanza legge~: Clement V (Bertrand de Got) was born
in Gascony ^ca.~ 1264.  He was archbishop of Bordeaux before his
election to the papacy on June 5, 1305, in succession to Benedict XI,
and he was crowned on November 14 of that year.  He died near Avignon,
on April 20, 1314.  It was during the pontificate of Clement V (who
appears never to have entered Italy) that the papal see was removed to
Avignon (1309), where it remained for over seventy years in what has
been called the Babylonian Captivity.  Clement owed his election to the
influence of Philip the Fair ("chi Francia regge," vs. 87), and as pope
was little more than a puppet of the French king.  See Villani, VIII,
80; E. Gorra (1917).

	Here in Canto XIX, Clement is judged only as a simoniacal
pope, who will take his place with Nicholas III and Boniface VIII
in the third ^bolgia~ of the eighth circle.  At other points in
the poem, Clement will be denounced bitterly on other grounds,
though he is never mentioned by name.  Villani (IX, 59) says of
him: "Questi fu uomo molto cupido di moneta, e simoniaco, che
ogni beneficio per danari s'avea in sua corte." ("He was a man
very greedy for money, and a simoniac.  At his court, any
benefice could be had for money.")

	|85-87.  Nuovo Ias$on...suo re~: Jason (born Joshua),
second son of the high priest Simon, wrested the office of high
priest from his own brother by promising the king, Antiochus IV
Epiphanes, 360 talents of silver; see II Mach. 4:7-8.  Antiochus
(died ^ca.~ 164 B.C.) and Jason then endeavored to root out the
Jewish religion and to introduce Greek customs and the worship of
Greek divinities; see II Mach. 4:13-16.  This attempt led to an
uprising of the Jews under the Maccabees; see I Mach. 6:1-16.

	|87.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~

	|lui~: Dative.

	|chi Francia regge~: Philip the Fair.  Even as Antiochus
favored Jason, so Philip will have Clement made pope; see n. to vs.
83.

	|88.  s'i' mi fui~: The reflexive in such constructions
can hardly be translated, but it sets off the subject by
reinforcing it with something of the suggestion of "on my part."

	|s'i' mi fui qui troppo folle~: Freely, "whether I went too
far." See ^Inf.~ II, 35; XXVI, 125.

	|89.  pur rispuosi~: Goes back to "troppo folle" (vs. 88)
with the touch, "But I did reply to him so."

	|a questo metro~:  The phrase is obviously trenchant: "I sang
him this tune."

	|91-92.  in prima...ch'~ = ^prima...che.~

	|92.  ch'ei ponesse le chiavi in sua bal@ia~: See Matt.
16:18-19: "Et ego dico tibi, quia tu es Petrus, et super hanc
petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam....Et tibi dabo claves regni
caelorum."  ("And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my Church....And I will give thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven.")

	|93.  Viemmi~ = ^vienmi.~  See Matt. 4: 18-19:

     Ambulans autem Iesus iuxta mare Galilaeae vidit duos
     fratres, Simonem qui vocatur Petrus, et Andream fratrem
     eius, mittentes rete in mare (erant enim piscatores).  Et
     ait illis: Venite post me, et faciam vos fieri piscatores
     hominum.

     As he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two
     brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother
     Andrew, casting a net into the sea (for they were
     fishermen).  And he said to them, "Come, follow me, and I
     will make you fishers of men."

	|94-96.  Matia...l'anima ria~: Matthias the Apostle was
chosen by lot ("sortito") to fill the place of Judas Iscariot;
see Actus 1:24-26.

	|97.  Per@o ti sta~: Again the pleonastic reflexive in
its "distancing" function; freely, "Stay right here where you
are."

	|ben~: "Justly."

	|98.  e guarda ben~: The "ben" echoes that of the
preceding verse.  The hole in which the pope is thrust is like a
purse, where, with his head down, he should be able to guard the
money with which he justly perished; see n. to vs. 72.

	|a mal tolta moneta~: See vs. 72.

	|98-99.  la mal tolta moneta...Carlo ardito~: This
probably refers to Nicholas' part in an intrigue against Charles
of Anjou, brother of St. Louis and king of Naples and Sicily,
who had refused to marry Nicholas' niece.  It was commonly
believed that the Eastern emperor, Michael Palaeologus, supplied
Pope Nicholas with funds to aid a Sicilian rebellion against
Charles that led to an insurrection known as the Sicilian Vespers
and to the eventual loss (after Nicholas' death) of Sicily by the
house of Anjou (see Villani, VII, 54).  This was, however, only
one of a number of plots and counterplots with and against the
royal houses of Europe which were part of Nicholas' brief career
as pope.

	|104.  la vostra avarizia~: Passing to the plural ^voi~
at this point, Dante condemns all simoniacal popes and churchmen
for their avarice (see ^Inf.~ VII, 46-48).

	|105.  calcando i buoni e sollevando i pravi~: Buti
comments:

     Li pastori simoniaci della santa Chiesa fanno tristo il
     mondo, per ch'ellino calcano i buoni non accettandoli a'
     benef@ici, perch@e non @anno che dare; e inalzino li rei per
     danari, accettandoli a' benef@ici: e cos@i danno materia a'
     cherici d'essere tristi, e non curare se non d'avere danari,
     sperando per quelli d'ottenere ogni grazia.

     The simoniacal pastors of the Holy Church make the world
     wicked; for they put down good men, and do not give them
     benefices because they cannot pay; and they raise up bad
     men, and give them benefices.  With that, they give clerics
     cause to be wicked, and to think of nothing but getting
     money, through which they can hope to obtain any favor.

	|106-111.  il Vangelista...al suo marito piacque~: See
Apoc. 17:1-3, 7, 9, 12, 18:

     Et venit unus de septem angelis qui habebant septem phialas,
     et locutus est mecum dicens: Veni, ostendam tibi damnationem
     meretricis magnae quae sedet super aquas multas, cum qua
     fornicati sunt reges terrae....  Et abstulit me in spiritu
     in desertum, et vidi mulierem sedentem super bestiam
     coccineam plenam nominibus blasphemiae, habentem capita
     septem et cornua decem.  ...Et dixit mihi angelus: Quare
     miraris? Ego dicam tibi sacramentum mulieris et bestiae quae
     portat eam, quae habet capita septem et cornua decem....Et
     hic est sensus, qui habet sapientiam: septem capita, septem
     montes sunt super quos mulier sedet: et reges septem
     sunt....Et decem cornua quae vidisti, decem reges sunt, qui
     regnum nondum acceperunt....Et mulier quam vidisti, est
     civitas magna quae habet regnum super reges terrae.

     And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven
     bowls, and he spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show thee
     the condemnation of the great harlot who sits upon many
     waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed
     fornication...."  And he took me away in spirit into a
     desert.  And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored
     beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and
     ten horns....And the angel said to me, "Wherefore dost thou
     wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of
     the beast that carries her which has the seven heads and the
     ten horns....And here is the meaning for him who has wisdom.
     The seven heads arc seven mountains upon which the woman
     sits; and they are seven kings....  And the ten horns that
     thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received a kingdom
     as yet....And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city
     which has kingship over the kings of the carth."

For the author of the Apocalypse, the "civitas magna" was
presumably imperial Rome; for Dante it is Christian Rome.  Dante,
moreover, has combined woman and beast, and made of the one
figure the symbol of the corrupt Church, who "whores" with kings.

	|108.  a lui~ = ^da lui.~

	|109.  le sette teste~: The Seven Gifts of the Holy
Spirit; see ^Purg.~ XXIX, 73-78.

	|110.  e da le diece corna ebbe argomento~: The ten horns
symbolize the Ten Commandments, from which the Church derived
strength as long as the pope ("suo marito," vs. 111) governed
virtuously.

	|112.  Fatto v'avete dio d'oro e d'argento~: "Gold and
silver" are also paired earlier in this canto, in vss. 4 and 95.
See Ps.  113B [115]:4: "Simulacra gentium argentum et aurum."
("Their idols are silver and gold.")  See also Eph. 5:5: "aut
avarus, quod est idolorum servitus" ("or covetous one -- for that
is idolatry").  And see Osee 8:4: "Argentum suum et aurum suum
fecerunt sibi idola."  ("Of their silver and their gold they have
made idols to themselves.")

	|113.  idolatre~: Plural of ^idolatra~; see the similar
form, "omicide," in ^Inf.~ XI, 37.

	|114.  se non ch'elli uno, e voi ne orate cento~: This
verse may be construed to mean: "For every idol they worship, you
worship a hundred."  Or, since the verse perhaps contains a
reference to the Golden Calf of the Israelites, it may mean: "You
worship not just one idol, but everything that is of gold."

	|115.  matre~ = ^madre~ (see n. to vs. 117).

	|116.  non la tua conversion~: See ^Par.~ X, 55-59.

	|quella dote~: According to a legend universally accepted in
the Middle Ages as historical fact, Constantine the Great (Roman
Emperor 306-37), before he removed his government to Byzantium,
abandoned to the Church his temporal power in the West.  This so-called
Donation of Constantine is said to have been made by the emperor in
return for his having been cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester I.
Lorenzo Valla, who flourished more than a century after Dante's death,
proved the Donation to be a forgery; it is now thought to have been
composed at the papal court or in France in the second half of the
eighth century (see B. Nardi, 1944, pp.  109-59).

	Dante did not doubt the authenticity of a document so
widely accepted as genuine in his day, but he did deny that it
had any juridical value (see ^De mon.~ III, x, 1-6).  From the
way in which Dante refers to it, Nardi (1944, pp. 144-45)
concludes that he did not know directly the text of the Donation;
he cites as evidence ^De mon.~ III, x, 1: "Dicunt adhuc quidam
quod Constantinus imperator, mundatus a lepra intercessione
Silvestri tunc summi pontificis, Imperii sedem, scilicet Romam,
donavit Ecclesie cum multis aliis Imperii dignitatibus."  ("It is
further urged by some that the Emperor Constantine, when cleansed
of his leprosy at the intercession of Sylvester, who was then
supreme pontiff, granted the seat of empire, to wit Rome, to the
church, together with many other dignities of the empire.")

	|117.  il primo ricco patre~: Sylvester I (pope 314-35).
See n. to vs. 116.

	|patre~ = ^padre.~  See n. to vs. 115.

	|118.  cantava cotai note~: These words have the same
trenchant tone as "metro" in vs. 89.

	|120.  forte~: The adjective is used for the
adverb.

	|piote~: "Feet" or "soles."  According to E. G.
Parodi (1957, p. 275), the word is still used in some parts of
northern Italy.  It is not necessarily a sarcastic or derisive
term (see ^Par.~ XVII, 13).

	|121.  al mio duca piacesse~: What pleased Virgil was
that Dante should sing him "such notes."

	|122.  labbia~: "Countenance."  See ^Inf.~ VII, 7.

	|attese~: "Heeded."

	|123.  espresse~: "Uttered" by Dante.

	|124.  con ambo le braccia~: This amounts to an embrace,
for this time Virgil clasps Dante to his breast, whereas he had
carried him down the bank on his hip (vss. 40-45).

	|128.  s@i men port@o~ = ^s@i me ne port@o.~  On this
construction see vs. 44 and the note.

	|129.  tragetto~: "Crossing"; see E. G. Parodi (1957),
p. 272.

	|130.  spuose~ = ^depose.~

	|131.  soave~: The adjective is used for the adverb;
"soave" repeats "soavemente," vs. 130.
