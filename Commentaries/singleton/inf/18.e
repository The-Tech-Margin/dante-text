	|1.  Malebolge~: Name invented by Dante to combine the
word ^malo~ ("evil") and ^bolgia~ ("pouch").  The ^Anonimo~
^fiorentino~ comments: "Dice l'Auttore che questo luogo dello
inferno, dove poeticamente discrive dieci cerchietti, @e chiamato
Malebolge, che tanto vuole dire quanto Male sacco, o veramente
Male valige."   ("The author says that this place in Hell, where he
poetically depicts ten small circles, is called Malebolge, which
means the evil sacks, or the evil bags.")

	|2.  pietra di color ferrigno~: "Dark stone"; see "sasso
tetro" in vs. 34.

	|3.  la cerchia~: The "stagliata rocca" of ^Inf.~ XVII,
134; also called here in Canto XVIII "alta ripa" (vs. 8) and
"roccia" (vs. 16).  ^Cerchia~ was commonly used in Dante's time
to designate the walls encircling a city (see ^Par.~ XV, 97).
Such a connotation may be intended here, since the wayfarers now
are entering a new area of Hell, a new "city."

	|il volge~: "Surrounds it."

	|4.  Nel dritto mezzo~: "In the exact center."

	|campo~:  The whole "field" is seen as if from some vantage
point above.  It is the poet Dante, not the character in the poem, who
knows the entire configuration.

	|6.  suo loco~: "In the proper place."  This Latin phrase
was current in Dante's day.  The "place" will prove to be ^Inf.~
XXXI; the pit here referred to leads down into the ninth and last
circle.

	|dicer@o~ = ^dir@o.~

	|l'ordigno~: "Arrangement."

	|7.  cinghio~: The whole circular area or band that
constitutes the eighth circle, between the wall of stone and the
pit.

	|9.  valli~: Plural of ^valle.~

	|10-12.  Quale...rende figura~: This should be construed:
^Quale figura~ [object] ^rende la parte~ [subject] ^dove sono i~
^fossi che cingono un castello.~  The reader was told (^Inf.~
VIII, 76-77) that such concentric moats surround the walls of the
city of Dis.

	|13.  quelli~: The "fossi" of vs. 11.

	|14.  sogli~ (plural of ^soglio~) = ^soglie.~

	|15.  la ripa di fuor~: "The outside bank" of the moat
farthest from the castle.

	|ponticelli~: Little drawbridges span the moats.

	|16.  scogli~: Unlike the drawbridges that connect the
moats surrounding a castle, the "reefs of stone" spanning the ten
concentric ^bolge~ that constitute the eighth circle, or
Malebolge, are not artificial but natural bridges.  They are very
rough on top, as indicated by the word "scheggia" (vs. 71) and by
many later references.  How many of these reefs extend from the
wall of stone to the pit at the center, like spokes in a wheel,
we are not told.  Each spans the ten ^bolge~ (except for one
breakdown which the reader will learn of later) and makes
successive abutments of their banks.  The yawning pit at the
center "terminates" the reefs and "gathers them in" (vs. 18) like
the hub of a wheel.(See Fig. 6, p. 312.)

	|17.  movien~ = ^movevano.~

	|ricidien~ = ^recidevano~, "traversed."

	|18.  i~ = ^li.~

	|raccogli~ = ^raccoglie.~  Other editors have read "racco'gli
(See E.G. Parodi, 1957, p. 242) and this is possible, taking the form
^gli~ to be the direct object plural ^li.~  See Petrocchi's note on
this; also Parodi (1957), pp.  351-52.

	|19.  In questo uogo~: Having viewed the eighth circle
panoramically, the reader is brought back to the narrative.

	|scossi~: The word suggests a new meaning for
"discarcate," ^Inf.~ XVII, 135 Geryon, in his spitefulness,
literally had shaken the wayfarers from his back.

	|20.  trovammoci~ = ^ci trovammo.~

	|21.  tenne a sinistra~: Virgil resumes the normal spiral
direction through Hell, turning to the left.  He and his charge
now walk across the stone margin between the high wall and the
first ^bolgia~; and when they come to the first reef, which will
serve them as walkway and bridge over the ^bolge~, they will turn
to the right as they ascend it and proceed.  The right turn is
necessitated by the configuration of this eighth circle and bears
no symbolic meaning.  See n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 31.

	|22.  pieta~: Pronounced ^pi@eta~; see ^Inf.~ II, 106.

	|23.  novi frustatori~: In this series of new things the
"new scourgers" come with some surprise for the reader and
generate a momentary suspense.  These scourgers are also "novi"
in the usual sense of "strange," since they are "horned demons"
(see vs. 35).

	|24.  repleta~: A Latinism current in Dante's day and
used elsewhere by him.

	|25.  ignudi~: As usual, whenever the pain of a
particular torment is increased by a soul's going naked, this
condition is emphasized (see, for example, ^Inf.~ XIII, 116).
Such is clearly the case here, for these souls -- the panders and
seducers -- are scourged by demons.

	|26-27.  dal mezzo in qua...di l@a con noi~: As the
simile of vss. 28-33 at once makes clear, the first ^bolgia~
holds two files of sinners, who proceed around it in opposite
directions.  Those in the file nearest the wayfarer ("dal mezzo
in qua") -- the panders -- go in a counterclockwise direction, and so
are said to come "toward us"; whereas the other file -- the
seducers -- keeping to the inner half of the ^bolgia~, circulates
clockwise, thus moving in the same direction as Virgil and Dante,
who are still walking along between the high wall and the first
^bolgia.~

	|26.  venien~ = ^venivano.~

	|27.  ma con passi maggiori~: The phrase refers to the
souls just described as moving in the same direction as the
wayfarer, who therefore can compare their pace with his own.
However, those who come toward him are also moving faster than he
is, for both groups, whipped by demons, are driven to go faster
than they might otherwise choose (see vss. 37-39).

	|28-29.  come i Roman...giubileo~: This first Jubilee of
the Roman church was proclaimed by Boniface VIII in his bull
^Antiquorum habet fdem~, dated February 22, 1300, but with
retroactive force to the previous Christmas (1299).  This bull
granted indulgence to all who visited the basilicas of San Pietro
and San Paolo fuori le Mura on a certain number of days during
the year and confessed and repented of their sins.  Villani
(VIII, 36) gives the following account:

     Negli anni di Cristo 1300, secondo la nativitade di
     Cristo...papa Bonifazio ottavo che allora era apostolico,
     nel detto anno a reverenza della nativit@a di Cristo, fece
     somma e grande indulgenza in questo modo; che qualunque
     Romano visitasse infra tutto il detto anno, continuando
     trenta d@i, le chiese de' beati apostoli santo Pietro e
     santo Paolo, e per quindici d@i l'altra universale gente che
     non fossono Romani, a tutti fece piena e intera perdonanza
     di tutti i suoi peccati, essendo confesso o si confessasse,
     di colpa e di pena....E fu la pi@u mirabile cosa che mai si
     vedesse, che al continuo in tutto l'anno durante, avea in
     Roma oltre al popolo romano, duecentomila pellegrini, sanza
     quegli ch'erano per gli cammini andando e tornando, e tutti
     erano forniti e contenti di vittuaglia giustamente, cos@i i
     cavalli come le persone, e con molta pazienza, e sanza
     romori o zuffe: ed io il posso testimoniare, che vi fui
     presente e vidi.

     In the year of Christ 1300, according to the birth of
     Christ...Pope Boniface VIII, who then occupied the Holy See,
     granted a supreme and great indulgence in that year, to
     commemorate the birth of Christ.  It was to be in this
     manner: to Romans who, within the space of that year,
     visited the churches of the Blessed Apostles St. Peter and
     St. Paul for thirty consecutive days, and to all others who
     were not Romans who did so for fifteen days, a full and
     complete pardon of all sins would be granted as well as
     remission of guilt and punishment, provided the sins were or
     would be confessed....  And it was the most wondrous thing
     ever seen, for throughout the entire year, there were
     continuously two hundred thousand pilgrims in Rome, aside
     from the Romans themselves, and not counting those who were
     on the roads, coming or going.  All were properly and
     satisfactorily provided with victuals, the horses as well as
     the people; and it was done with great patience and without
     uproar or arguments.  And I can testify to it, for I was
     present, and I saw it.

It is thought that Dante was in Rome during that year and
himself witnessed the remarkable organization here described.

	|28.  essercito~ = ^esercito~, "multitude," "host."

	|29.  lo ponte~: The Ponte Sant'Angelo, a bridge over the
Tiber at Rome, was built by the Emperor Hadrian to connect his
tomb (the present Castel Sant'Angelo; see n. to vs. 32) with the
city.  In Dante's day it was the only bridge serving the
Trastevere section where St.  Peter's is located.  and
accordingly was very crowded at the time of the Jubilee.

	|32.  'l castello~: The Castel Sant'Angelo, on the right
bank of the Tiber at Rome, originally the Moles Hadriani, was
erected by Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his successors.
It owes its modern name to the tradition that Gregory the Great
(pope 590-604), while leading a procession to pray for the
cessation of the plague, beheld the archangel Michael sheathing
his sword above the castle, in commemoration of which a chapel
was subsequently erected at the summit of the building by
Boniface IV (pope 608-615).(See Plate 4.)

	|33.  'l monte~: Monte Giordano, a low hill across the
Tiber from Castel Sant'Angelo.

	|34.  su per lo sasso tetro~: The devils walk among the
sinners, on the dark stone of the bottom of the ^bolgia.~

	|35.  demon~ (pronounced ^dem@on~) = ^demoni~, plural of
"demonio" (vs. 64).

	|ferze~ = ^sferze~, "whips."

	|36.  battien~ = ^battevano.~

	|37.  levar le berze~: This phrase probably is one of the
derisive taunts that now become more frequent in Dante's
description of lower Hell.  The ^A nonimo fiorentino~ says:
"Vocabolo antico et volgare, et vuol dire le calcagna."  ("This is
an old and common word, and it means heels.")  See "zucca"
(literally, "gourd") used for "head" (vs. 124), and "broda"
("soup") for the mire of Styx (^Inf.~ VIII, 53).  For present-day
usage of ^berze~ in certain North Italian dialects, see E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 352, and G. Bertoni (1933), p. 25.

	|38-39.  gi@a nessuno...le terze~: The jeering tone of
the narrative becomes more evident in this turn of phrase.

	|41.  furo~ = ^furono.~

	|furo scontrati~ = ^si scontrarono.~

	|42.  Gi@a di veder costui non son digiuno~: Now the
derisive note enters even into what the wayfarer says, though
here he speaks mainly to himself.  Grandgent translates the
phrase: "I am not fasting for previous sight of him."

	|43.  figurarlo~ = ^raffigurarlo.~

	|affissi~: See "affisse," ^Inf.~ XII, 115.

	|45.  assentio~ = ^assent@i.~

	|gissi~: First person past subjunctive of ^gire.~

	|46.  celar si credette~: The wish to hide oneself, to
avoid being recognized, becomes more and more frequent on the
part of sinners in lower Hell.  See n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 67-73.

	|47.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|49.  se le fazion che porti non son false~: The verse
stresses the fraudulent, deceptive aspect of pandering.  See the
^Ottimo Commento's~ gloss on "femmine da conio" (vs. 66): "Quando
uno inganna altro, quello si dice coniare; mostra uno, ed @e
altro.  Coniare @e mutare d'una forma ad altra forma, e viene a
dire ingannare, fare falso conio, falsa forma."  ("When one
deceives the other, it is called ^coniare~: he seems to be one
thing, and is another.  ^Coniare~ means to change from one form
to another, and signifies to deceive, to make false coin, false
form.")  The thrust is aimed at one who is recognized as having
been guilty, in life, of changing "from one form to another."
See n. to vs. 66.

	|50.  Venedico...Caccianemico~: Venedico de' Caccianemici
dell'Orso, of Bologna, was the son of Alberto de' Caccianemici,
head of the Geremei, or Guelph party of Bologna.  Venedico
(pronounced ^Ven@edico~) is said to have gained the marquis of
Este admittance to the bedchamber of his sister Ghisolabella for
money.  Venedico was at various times ^podest@a~ of Pistoia,
Modena, Imola, and Milan and was, with his father, an active
opponent of the Lambertazzi, or Ghibelline party of Bologna.  He
was a staunch ally of the marquis of Este (Obizzo II; see n. to
^Inf.~ XII, 111-12), and his support of the marquis's policy with
regard to Bologna appears to have led to his expulsion from his
native city in 1289.  He died in January 1303, although clearly
Dante believed him dead by 1300.  (On Venedico see C. Ricci, 1921a,
pp. 10-11; G. Zaccagnini, 1914, pp. 27-47, 1915, 1934, pp.  19-
40; Q. S@antoli, 1921; G. Gozzadini, 1875, pp. 212-21.)

	|51.  s@i pungenti salse~: Benvenuto, who knew Bologna
well, comments:

     Ad intelligentiam huius literae, ut videas quot sunt occulta
     et ignorata in isto libro, volo te scire, quod ^Salse~ est
     quidam locus Bononiae concavus et declivus extra civitatem
     post et prope sanctam Mariam in Monte, in quem solebant
     abiici corpora desperatorum, foeneratorum, et aliorum
     infamatorum.  Unde aliquando audivi pueros Bononiae dicentes
     unum alteri ad improperium: Tuus pater fuit proiectus ad
     Salsas.  Ad propositum ergo autor vult dicere: Quid ducit te
     ad vallem tam infamem, sicut est vallis Salsarum apud
     patriam tuam?  Non ergo capias hic Salsas pro sapore, sicut
     communiter omnes exponunt, quia metaphora esset aliena a
     proposito, ut per se patet.

     So that you may understand this word, and at the same time
     see how many things are hidden and unknown in this book, I
     want you to know that ^Salse~ is a certain sloping, concave
     place outside Bologna, just past Santa Maria in Monte.  The
     bodies of desperate criminals, usurers, and other
     unspeakable persons used to be thrown there.  And I have
     heard boys in Bologna say to each other as an insult: your
     father was thrown to Salse.  Thus, what the author means to
     say is: what has brought you to a valley as infamous as the
     valley of Salse in your homeland? In this passage,
     therefore, you must not interpret "Salse" as having to do
     with taste, as is commonly done.  For it is self-evident
     that such an interpretation would not correspond to the
     author's intention.

On the other hand, "salse," in its derisive context here, makes
perfectly good sense without reference to the Salse of Bologna.
M. Barbi (1934b, p. 241) quotes a passage from Fra Giordano da
Rivalto which is an example of the word's metaphorical use.  See
Fra Giordano da Rivalto, ^Prediche~ XXVI (1831 edn.), vol. 1,.pp.
201-2:

     Tu vedrai uno ricco uomo, e parratti ch'abbia tutta la
     gloria del mondo, e penserai che Iddio l'ami molto, ed egli
     n'avr@a molte volte molto poca; non sapete le salse, c'hanno
     questi ricchi, e non sapete la mostarda, c'hanno questi
     signori, no; le mostarde, e le salse, che si trovano nel
     matrimonio, e nelle ricchezze, e nelle signor@ie....  Voi
     sentite pur le vostre, ma voi non sentite le loro....  Ben
     lo ti credo, che tu no'l credi, ch@e tu non hai provato
     delle mostarde, c'ha provato egli.

     You see a rich man, and it will seem that he possesses all
     the glory in the world, and you will think God must love him
     very much.  And very often, he will possess but very little
     glory.  No, you do not know what sauces these rich men must
     bear, nor what mustard.  The mustards and the sauces that
     are in matrimony, in riches, in lordship....You feel your
     own, but you do not feel theirs....I can well believe that
     you do not believe it, for you have not tried the mustards
     he has tried.

It seems possible that Dante has drawn on both senses of the
word, effectively increasing the sarcasm of the taunt.  The
Bolognese Venedico would thus get the thrust in both senses, but
particularly in its reference to his native city; hence perhaps
his own reference to Dante's "plain speech," which causes him to
remember the "former world."

	|55.  la Ghisolabella~: Sister of Venedico de'
Caccianemici, who is said to have accepted a bribe to betray her
to the marquis of Este (see n. to vs. 50).  The marquis
reportedly took his pleasure and abandoned the fair lady, who
nevertheless later (in or before 1270) married Niccol@o da
Fontana of Ferrara.  The early commentators and editors write the
name as two words, "Ghisola bella," and assume that she was so
called because of her beauty.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says:
"Per eccellenzia, per@o che avanzava in bellezza tutte le donne
bolognesi a quello tempo, fu chiamata la Ghisola bella."  ("She
was called 'Ghisola bella' by virtue of her manifest superiority,
for she was more beautiful than any other Bolognese woman of that
time.")  Ghisolabella or Ghislabella, however, may well have been
her name, as indicated by her will, dated September 1, 1281, in
which she is described as "D. Ghislabella, filia quondam domini
Alberti de Cazanimitis, et uxor domini Nichollay de Fontana"
("Lady Ghislabella, daughter of Signor Alberto de' Caccianemici
and wife of Signor Niccol@o da Fontana").  For the will, see
I. Del Lungo (1888), p. 270.  For Ghisolabella and a possible
explanation of Dante's attitude toward Venedico, see Del Lungo
(1888), pp. 235-47.

	|59.  anzi n'@e questo loco tanto pieno~: Denunciation of
particular cities of Italy for this or that sin begins here in
earnest, although Florence has already come in for very severe
judgment on more than one count, including usury (as did Padua in
^Inf.~ XVII, 70).

	|60.  apprese~: "Capable of," "given to" saying ^sipa.~

	|61.  sipa~: Archaic Bolognese dialect for ^sia~ (modern
Bolognese ^sepa~), often used for "yes."

	|S@avena e Reno~:  These two rivers of northern Italy both rise
in the Tuscan Apennines and flow north through Emilia.  The Savena, the
smaller stream, leaves Bologna about two miles to the west; the Reno
leaves Bologna about two miles to the east.  Thus the two streams
roughly indicate the eastern and western limits of Bologna and her
territory.

	|63.  seno~: "Disposition."  Benvenuto comments:

     Nota quod autor capit hic avaritiam large; nam bononiensis
     naturaliter et comuniter non est avarus in retinendo, sed in
     capiendo tantum.  Illi enim, qui sunt vitiosi, ibi
     prodigaliter expendunt ultra vires facultatis vel lucri;
     ideo faciunt turpia lucra, aliquando cum ludis, aliquando
     cum furtis, aliquando cum lenociniis, exponentes filias,
     sorores, et uxores libidini, ut satisfaciant gulae et
     voluptatibus suis.

     Note that the author here means avarice in the wide sense.
     Generally, and by nature, the Bolognese are not avaricious
     about keeping things, but only in acquiring them.  In fact,
     those subject to this vice very often spend prodigally, far
     beyond their earnings and their possibilities.  For that
     reason, they earn money in shameful ways -- by gambling,
     stealing, or pimping, subjecting their own daughters,
     sisters, and wives to the lust of others, just to satisfy
     their own gluttony and their own pleasures.

	|65.  de la~ = ^con la.~

	|scuriada~: Also ^scuriata~; literally, a "horsewhip," but also
a whip for children, as Buti says in his commentary on ^Inf.~ XXV, 79:
"Ferza e scuriata @e una medesima cosa, et @e lo strumento con che si
batte lo cavallo, o vero li fanciulli."  (^"Ferza~ and ^scuriata~ mean
the same thing, an instrument with which to whip horses or children.")

	|66.  femmine da conio~: I. Del Lungo (1888, pp. 199-269)
made an exhaustive study of this much-debated phrase.  In his
commentary on the ^Inferno~ he concluded:

     "Da conio," da inganno, da ingannare, da corrompere con
     frode.  I sostantivi ^conio, coniello~; i verbi ^coniare~,
     ^coniellare~; i verbali ^coniatore, coniellatore~, sono
     formali nel linguaggio statutale d'allora, per designare
     inganno di frodolenti.  E distintivo del mezzano @e la
     frode; compresivi i ruffiani di mestiere, per turpe lucro,
     al che @e l'allusione dei vv. 59-63.

     "Da conio" -- made for deception -- that which deceives, which
     corrupts through fraud.  The substantives ^conio~,
     ^coniello~; the verbs ^coniare, coniellare~; and the nouns
     ^coniatore, coniellatore~ are all used in the statutory
     language of the time to designate fraudulent deception.  The
     distinguishing characteristic of the pander is fraud.  And
     that includes the professional pimp who does it for filthy
     lucre -- to which vss. 59-63 allude.

Torraca cites the early Italian Aesop (fable XLIII): "i malvagi
coniatori, i quali s'adornono e mostrono apparenzia di buone
persone...acci@o che meglio possino coniare e tradire e
ingannare" ("the evil falsifiers [^coniatori~], who cloak
themselves with the appearance of good men...so that they may all
the better falsify, betray, and deceive").

	Clearly, panders are being punished here in the first
^bolgia~ of the eighth circle for fraud, and this aspect of the
meaning is essential.  However, in the immediate context, with
the reference to the "avaricious nature" of the Bolognese, the
meaning of "conio" as the steel die used in minting (Latin
^cuneus~, OFr ^coigne~, English ^coin~) would seem to be
uppermost in its reference to money.  Thus on "da conio" G.
Bertoni (1933, p. 28) hesitated between the meaning ^da
mercanteggiare~ ("for purposes of trade") and ^da ingannare~
("for purposes of deception").  Both meanings probably are
present, the first being predominant.  Venedico induced his
sister to do the will of the marquis, probably on the basis of
false promises, and this was a fraudulent act, but he did so for
coin, for hire.  For a recent discussion of the meaning of
"femmine da conio," see W. Conner (1955).

	|67.  mi raggiunsi~ = ^mi ricongiunsi.~

	|68.  divenimmo~ = ^pervinimmo.~  See ^Inf.~ XIV, 76.

	|69.  l@a 'v' uno~ = ^l@a ove uno.~

	|la ripa~: "La cerchia" (vs. 3).

	|uscia~ = ^usciva.~

	|71.  scheggia~: Literally, "chip"; here used to indicate
the jagged top of the stone reef.

	|72.  da quelle cerchie etterne~: E. Bianchi (1921)
proposes that "cerchie" here refers to the custom of whipping a
condemned man along a certain course through the city as he was
led to the place of execution. He cites two passages from Antonio
Francesco Grazzini's ^Le Cene~ (I, 5), pp. 115, 116.  The first
is: "L'altra mattina, facendo le cerchie maggiori per Pisa, fosse
attanagliato e finalmente squartato vivo."  ("The other morning,
after first having been made to take the widest course around
Pisa, he was then tortured with pincers and finally quartered
alive.")  The second citation is: "Lo infelicissimo Fazio, fatto
per tutta Pisa le cerchie maggiori, in piazza condotto, sopra un
palchetto a posta fatto...dal manigoldo in presenza di tutto il
popolo fu squartato."  ("The unhappy Fazio, after having been made
to take to the widest course in Pisa, was brought to the square,
placed upon a specially constructed platform...  and was
quartered by the executioner, in the presence of the entire
populace.")  Bianchi concludes that "cerchie etterne" refers to
the "eternal circlings" of the sinners under the demons'
whiplashes.  He goes on to say that the adjective "eternal" lends
an unexpected and terrifying suggestion of Divine Justice.

	Although Bianchi's examples are late (Grazzini died in
1584), as are those cited by M. Barbi (1921, 1924b), certainly,
as G. Vandelli has observed (1932a, p. 196), the expression
^cerchie~, or ^cerchia~, or ^cerca~, in this meaning might be as
old as the custom to which it refers.  Commentators have not (to
my knowledge) noted that this custom figures in Boccaccio's
^Decameron~ in a context that further suggests that such a
punishment for panders and seducers, especially the latter,
applies here.  In the seventh story of Day V, a certain Pietro is
arrested for having got the daughter of Messer Amerigo with child
and is condemned to death and forced to suffer just this
punishment.  See ^Decam.~ V, 7 (vol. I, p. 386, 11. 34-36;
p. 387, 11. 7-8): "Pietro condannato, essendo da' famigliari menato
alle forche frustando, pass@o, s@i come a color che la brigata
guidavano piacque, davanti ad uno albergo....Era Pietro dalla
cintura ins@u tutto ignudo e con le mani legate di dietro."  ("The
condemned Pietro was being led to the gallows by people, who
whipped him.  At the pleasure of those who were leading the
group, he was made to pass before an inn....Pietro was naked to
the waist, with his hands tied behind his back.")  This Pietro was
making the ^cerchie~, although Boccaccio does not use the term.

	"Cerchie," in the present context, would thus appear to
carry a possible double meaning comparable to that of "salse" in
vs. 51 (see note).  First, the word applies to the actual
situation in Hell: the souls of the panders literally are
circling.  However, the fact that they are scourged as they go
calls up the image of the condemned man being whipped through the
city.

	The wayfarers proceed over the bridge, turning their
backs on the first file of sinners, the panders; in this sense
they leave the eternal circlings of the panders behind to attend
to the circlings of those who go in the opposite direction, the
seducers.  The demonstrative adjective in the immediate context
thus takes on a special force: "We departed from ^those~
everlasting circlings," in order to attend to the next.

	|73.  el~: The "scoglio" of vs. 69, upon which the
wayfarers walk as on a bridge.

	|75.  Attienti~: See ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 82.

	|feggia~ = ^ferisca.~

	|79.  Del~ = ^dal.~

	|traccia~: See ^Inf.~ XII, 55; XV, 33.

	|80.  ven@ia~ = ^veniva.~

	|86.  Ias$on~: Jason was the leader of the Argonauts on
their celebrated expedition to the land of Colchis in quest of
the golden fleece.  In the course of this adventure the Argonauts
visited Lemnos, where Jason seduced and abandoned Hypsipyle.  At
length they arrived in the land of the Colchians, where Medea,
the daughter of Ae,etes, king of Colchis, having fallen in love
with Jason, helped him secure the golden fleece.  When Jason and
his companions sailed away, they took Medea with them.  Jason
married Medea, but afterward deserted her for Creusa.

	The several episodes referred to in connection with Jason
are elaborated by Statius and Ovid: the seduction of Hypsipyle is
described in ^Theb.~ V, 403-85 (also in ^Heroides~ VI); the
betrayal of Medea in ^Heroides~ XII.  Valerius Flaccus
(^Argonautica~ II, 77-425) gives another version of the story of
Hypsipyle.  See E. R. Curtius (1950, pp. 398-428) on the ship of
the Argonauts.

	|87.  f$ene~ = ^fe' (fece~).  See the similar use of
"p@one" for ^p@o~ (^pu@o~) in ^Inf.~ XI, 31.

	|90.  dienno~ = ^diedero.~

	|91.  segni~: Mute tokens of affection.

	|92.  Isifile~: Hypsipyle was the daughter of Thoas, king
of Lemnos.  She secretly saved her father's life when the Lemnian
women killed all the other men on the island.  After the
Argonauts landed in Lemnos, she was seduced and abandoned by
Jason, by whom she had twin sons.  See n. to vs. 86.

	|94.  Lasciolla~ = ^la lasci@o.~

	|96.  Medea~: Daughter of Ae,etes, king of Colchis.  With
the help of Medea, Jason secured the golden fleece.  As the
condition of her assistance Jason promised to marry her.  He did
take her with him as his wife when he sailed from Colchis, but
afterward abandoned her for Creusa (sometimes called Glauce),
daughter of Creon, king of Corinth.  In revenge Medea caused the
death of Creusa and murdered her own two children by Jason. See
Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 1-397; also n. to vs. 86.

	|99.  assanna~ = ^azzanna.~

	|101.  con l'argine secondo~: The embankment that forms
the inner bank of the first ^bolgia~ and the outer bank of the
second.  The stone margin on which the wayfarers had walked
before climbing onto the reef was the first embankment.

	|103.  si nicchia~: Benvenuto comments: "sicut facit
aliquando infirmus in lecto" ("as a sick man sometimes does, in
his bed").  The term could be equivalent to ^si rannicchia~ and
mean "to nestle," but given the present context, such a meaning
seems less likely.  Virgil and Dante cannot see anything yet, but
only hear ("sentimmo") what is in the next ^bolgia.~

	|104.  scuffa~ = ^scuffa.~  Said of one who eats so
greedily that his nostrils become covered with the food and he
has to snort through it in order to breathe.  The exact way in
which this applies to these sinners is soon made clear.  Some
editors would read "sbuffa" ("puffs," "blows").

	|106.  grommate:~ "Caked."  ^Gromma~ is the deposit of
cream of tartar that wine leaves in the cask (see ^Par.~ XII,
114).  The "exhalation" is indeed thick, to make such a deposit
here.

	|109.  cupo~: The meaning can be either "deep" or "dark,"
but the latter seems preferable.

	|114.  che da li uman privadi parea mosso~: "Mosso"
clearly suggests that the "sterco" (vs. 113) would have been
transported here.  Could the poet have had in mind something
that must have been a common sight in his day and to which
Boccaccio refers in one of his stories, namely, those ditches
near the outskirts of the city into which human excrement
(jestingly called, in the story, "la contessa di Civillari") was
dumped for use as manure? See ^Decam.~ VIII, 9 (vol. II, p. 171,
ll. 17-19): "Erano allora per quella contrada fosse, nelle quali
i lavoratori di que' campi facevan votare la contessa di
Civillari per ingrassare i campi loro."  ("In that district, there
were ditches into which the peasants used to empty the countess
of Civillari, to fertilize the fields.")

	|116.  merda~: Here, as elsewhere in lower Hell, Dante's
language becomes deliberately nasty, violent, derisive, and
taunting, as it continues to be in the next verse.

	|118.  sgrid@o~: "Shouted angrily."

	|gordo~: See "ghiotto," ^Inf.~ XVI, 51.

	|119.  brutti~: All besmeared with excrement.  See ^Inf.~
VIII, 35.

	|122.  Alessio Interminei~: Of this Alessio, member of
the prominent Interminei or Interminelli family of Lucca, little
is known beyond the fact that he lived during the latter half of
the thirteenth century.  It appears from a document dated 1295
that he was alive in that year, and he must have died not long
after. (See C. Minutoli, 1865, pp. 200-10.)  Benvenuto says: "Iste
ergo Alexius ex prava consuetudine tantum delectabatur
adulatione, quod nullum sermonem sciebat facere, quem non
condiret oleo adulationis: omnes ungebat, omnes lingebat, etiam
vilissimos et mercenarios famulos; et ut cito dicam, totus
colabat, totus foetebat adulatione." ("Well, this Alessio had a
terrible habit: he was so given to flattery, that he was unable
to say anything at all without seasoning it with the oil of
adulation. He greased everyone, he licked everyone, even the most
vile and venal servants.  In short, he completely dripped with
flattery and stank of it.")

	|123.  t'adocchio~: See ^Inf.~ XV, 22.

	|124.  zucca~: Literally, "gourd," "pumpkin."  The tone
of derision in such words is evident.  See "berze," vs. 37, and
the note.  It should be noted that such terms are most often
rhyme words; the rhyme doubles the derisive effect.

	|126.  stucca~ = ^stuccata.~

	|127.  pinghe (pinga)~ = ^spinga.~

	|129.  attinghe~ = (^tu~) ^attinga.~

	|130.  fante~: "Wench," but with the strong connotation
of "prostitute"; see M. Barbi (1924c).

	|133.  Taide~: Tha,is, a courtesan in ^Eunuchus~, a play
by Terence.  In the episode referred to, Thraso, her lover, has
sent her a gift of a slave through a soldier named Gnatho.  There
is little doubt that Dante took the conversation, not from the
play itself (Act 3, sc. 1, ll. 1-2), with which he probably was
not acquainted, but from Cicero's ^De amicitia~ (XXVI, 98-99),
which he knew well.  Dante introduces the quotation in the same
context in which Cicero does, namely in illustration of the
habitual exaggeration indulged in by flatterers:

     Hos delectat assentatio, his fictus ad ipsorum voluntatem
     sermo cum adhibetur, orationem illam vanam testimonium esse
     laudum suarum putant.  Nulla est igitur haec amicitia, cum
     alter verum audire non volt, alter ad mentiendum paratus
     est.  Nec parasitorum in comoediis assentatio faceta nobis
     videretur, nisi essent milites gloriosi.

	magnas vero agere gratias Thais mihi?

     Satis erat respondere "magnas."  "Ingentis," inquit.  Semper
     auget assentator id, quod is, cuius ad voluntatem dicitur,
     volt esse magnum.  Quam ob rem, quamquam blanda ista vanitas
     apud eos valet, qui ipsi illam adlectant et invitant, tamen
     etiam graviores constantioresque admonendi sunt, ut
     animadvertant ne callida assentatione capiantur.

     Such men delight in flattery, and when a complimentary
     speech is fashioned to suit their fancy they think the empty
     phrase is proof of their own merits.  There is nothing,
     therefore, in a friendship in which one of the parties to it
     does not wish to hear the truth and the other is ready to
     lie.  Nor should we see any humour in the fawning parasites
     in comedies if there were no braggart soldiers.

	In truth did Thais send me many thanks?

     It would have been enough to answer, "Many."  "Millions of
     them," said the parasite.  The flatterer always magnifies
     that which the one for whose gratification he speaks wishes
     to be large.  Wherefore, although that sort of hollow
     flattery influences those who court and make a bid for it,
     yet even stronger and steadier men should be warned to be on
     their guard lest they be taken in by flattery of the crafty
     kind.

Through his undoubted ignorance of the play, Dante has attributed
to Thais the exaggerated reply ("ingentis") put by Terence into
the mouth of the parasite Gnatho.  In the original play this
entire exchange takes place between Thraso and Gnatho, not (as
Dante supposes, from an understandable misreading of Cicero,
taking his "Thais" as a vocative) between Thraso and Tha,is
directly.

	|134-135.  Ho io grazie grandi apo te?~  For the
expression ^aver grazie~ (the equivalent of ^gratias habere~ in
Latin), see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 110, a. I,
resp.: "Secundum communem modum loquendi tripliciter gratia
accipi consuevit: uno modo pro dilectione alicuius, sicut
consuevimus dicere quod iste miles habet gratiam regis, idest,
rex habet eum gratum." ("According to the common manner of
speech, grace is usually taken in three ways, first, for anyone's
love, as we are accustomed to say that the soldier is in the good
graces of the king, i.e., the king looks on him with favor.")
Also see ^Summa contra Gentiles~ III, 150: "Unde et qui ab aliquo
diligitur dicitur gratiam eius habere." ("Consequently, he who is
loved by another is said to enjoy his grace.")

	|135.  apo~ (Latin ^apud~) = ^presso.~
