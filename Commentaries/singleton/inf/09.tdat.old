<b>Eritòn</b>: Erichtho, a Thessalian sorceress, who,
according to Lucan (<i>Phars.</i> VI, 507-830), was employed by
Pompey's son Sextus to conjure up the spirit of one of his dead
soldiers on the eve of the battle of Pharsalia, so that he could
learn what was to be the outcome of the campaign. The story
Dante tells about Erichtho's sending Virgil into the nethermost
Hell is of unknown authority. It probably was suggested to Dante
by one of the numerous legends associated with Virgil in the
Middle Ages, when the Roman poet was universally regarded as a
magician. Boccaccio, for instance, in his comment on <i>Inf.</i> I,
71, calls Virgil &ldquo;solennissimo astrolago&rdquo; (&ldquo;a very great
astrologer&rdquo;) and gives a list of his wonderful performances. (On
this aspect of Virgil's reputation in the Middle Ages, see D.
Comparetti, 1955, pp. 26-67; also see E. Moore, 1896, pp. 234-37.)
Referring specifically to Dante's story about Erichtho and
Virgil, Boccaccio admits in his <i>Comento</i> that he cannot &ldquo;recall
ever having read or heard just what this story was.&rdquo; Benvenuto
was of the opinion that Dante invented the tale: &ldquo;Ista est
simpliciter fictio nova.&rdquo; (&ldquo;This is simply a new fiction.&rdquo;) But
the &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; is, in a sense, not so new: the Sibyl who guided
Aeneas through the nether regions declared that she had been
there once before and had seen all (<i>Aen.</i> VI, 562-65).

turns the other heavens in any physical sense, but does
&ldquo;encircle&rdquo; or enclose them (see Fig. 1, p. 34). The Empyrean
seems the more appropriate meaning here, since it is the tenth
sphere and as such is most remote from Hell. In this
antithetical sense, the circle in Hell that is farthest from
Heaven would contain the greatest evil and the worst sinners, as
indeed Judecca (<i>Inf.</i> XXIV, 117), the &ldquo;circle of Judas,&rdquo; will be
seen to do. Thus, Virgil not only has journeyed to Hell before

<b>a la man destra si fu vòlto</b>: This turn to the
right is more than a literary reminiscence (see <i>Aen.</i> VI, 540-
42). It is particularly striking here because the two wayfarers
have always turned to the left and -- with a minor exception to be
noted later and easily explained for literal reasons -- will
continue to do so. This unusual turn in Hell is thrown into
sharper relief by the fact that through Purgatory the pilgrim and
his guide always turn to the right as they climb. On a possible
significance of this exceptional turn to the right here in the
circle of heresy, see J. Freccero (1961a), p. 179:
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
This apparent exception to Dante's rule will help in reality
to prove it. Heresy, unlike all other sins in hell, attacks
the True, and not the Good; which is to say, in the words of
St. Thomas, that its <i>subiectum</i> is not <i>voluntas</i> but
rather <i>intellectus.</i> Here is the only instance in Dante's
moral system where an error of the speculative intellect is
punished in hell, a fact which no pagan, neither Cicero, nor
Aristotle, nor Virgil would have been able to understand.
It is for this reason that the pilgrim must perform his
retrograde movement to the right, in order to deal with an
aberration of the intellect in the realm of perverted will.
