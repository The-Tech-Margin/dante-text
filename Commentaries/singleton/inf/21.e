	|1.  di ponte in ponte~: From the bridge over the fourth
^bolgia~ to that which spans the fifth.

	|2.  la mia comed@ia~: See ^Inf.~ XVI, 128; see also the
similar form "traged@ia," ^Inf.~ XX, 113, and the note.

	|3.  tenavamo~ = ^tenevamo~, "were holding"(i.e., "were
standing on").

	|'l colmo~: The summit of the bridge over the
fifth ^bolgia~, now called a "fessura" (vs. 4).

	|5.  pianti vani~: Depends on "per veder" in the
preceding verse.  The wayfarer expects to see such
"lamentations," even as he has seen the bottom of the fourth
^bolgia~ bathed with "angoscioso pianto" (^Inf.~ X, 6).  Instead,
to his great surprise, he sees the fifth ^bolgia~ "marvelously
dark" (vs. 6); no sinners are visible in it.

	|6.  e vidila mirabilmente oscura~: The verse registers
great surprise and, with the long simile that follows, generates
considerable suspense because there is no one moving around on
this scene.  The ^bolgia~ is naturally dark, as are the others in
this eighth circle; but what creates the strange darkness that
the wayfarer "sees" (we are then told) is black pitch, which
becomes the subject of the simile in vss. 7-18.

	|vidila~ = ^la vidi.~

	|7-18.  Quale ne l'arzan@a...parte~: This simile is
neither digressive nor ornamental, as some commentators hold, but
serves to build up the suspense and surprise already present in
vs. 6.  The first term (vss. 7-15) describes a scene of great
activity around the boiling pitch in the Venetian Arsenal.  The
second term la single ^tercet~) contains nothing to match this,
nothing except boiling pitch.  This noncorrespondence of the two
terms of the figure is the most effective feature of the whole;
through the surprising difference thus brought out, the reader's
eye dwells on the "tenace pece" and its viscous bubbling./
"Quale" (vs. 7) modifies "pece" (vs. 8); construe: ^quale la
tenace pece bolle l'inverno.~  "Tal" (vs. 16) begins the second
term of the simile and refers to the "pece," now called "pegola"
(vs. 17).

	|7.  arzan@a~: Venetian form for ^arsenale.~

	|l'arzan@a de' Viniziani~: The Arsenal at Venice
(built in 1104 and greatly enlarged in 1303-4 and 1325) was one
of the most important shipyards in Europe in Dante's time.  About
two miles in perimeter, it was enclosed within high walls
surmounted by battlements and flanked by towers.  See F. C. Lane
(1934), pp. 129-31.

	|9.  rimpalmare~ = ^rispalmare~; "to pay," in the sense of
"to coat again with tar."

	|10.  navicar non ponno~: This is not to be taken
literally, although winter certainly is not the best season for
navigation and hence is a good time for building and repairing
ships.

	|ponno~ = ^possono~; the subject is "i Viniziani"
vs 7).

	|in quella vece~: "Instead of which."

	|11-15.  chi...chi...chi...~: The very movement of the
eye over the busy scene reinforces the sense of animation.

	|11.  ristoppa~: "Recaulks."

	|13.  ribatte~: "Hammers away," the prefix ^ri-~ implying
repeated blows.

	|14.  volge sarte~: The "sarte" are the ropes, the tackle
of the vessel.  They are made of twisted strands of hemp, hence
"volge."

	|15.  terzeruolo e artimon~: A sailing ship's three
principal sails are the mainsail, mizzen, and
jib.

	|rintoppa~ = ^rattoppa~, "patches."

	|17.  bollia~ = ^bolliva.~

	|pegola~: A synonym of "pece," from the Latin ^picula~,
originally a diminutive of ^pix.~  The words "pegola spessa" correspond
to the phrase "tenace pece" (vs. 8) in the first term of the simile.

	|18.  'nviscava~ = ^inviscava~; "was begluing," as with
bird lime (^vischio~).  See n. to ^Inf.~ XIII, 55-57.

	|19.  lei~: Refers to the "pegola" (vs. 17).

	|20.  mai che~ (Latin ^magis quam~) = ^pi@u che, altro
che.~  See ^Inf.~ IV, 26.

	|21.  gonfar~ = ^gonfiarsi.~

	|riseder~ = ^risedersi.~
See Virgil, ^Georg.~ II, 479-80: "unde tremor terris, qua vi
maria alta tumescant / obicibus ruptis rursusque in se ipsa
residant" ("whence come tremblings of the earth, the force to
make deep seas swell and burst their barriers, then sink back
upon themselves").

	|compressa~: Suggests the bursting of the bubbles in boiling
viscous liquid, and the settling back of the whole mass.

	|23.  Guarda~ = ^guardati~ (pronounced ^gu@ardati~): "look
out!"

	|24.  del loco dov' io stava~: From the edge of the
bridge, where the wayfarer is standing in order to look down into
the ^bolgia.~

	|25.  cui tarda~: Literally, "to whom it is late"; i.e.,
"who longs."

	|26.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|28.  che, per veder, non indugia 'l partire~: The
wayfarer looks and at the same time rushes to Virgil's side.

	|31.  fero~ = ^fiero.~

	|32.  acerbo~: "Fierce," "savage."

	|33.  con l'ali aperte e sovra i pi@e leggero~: The
devil's outspread (and no doubt batlike) wings make him "light of
foot," as if he were just alighting.

	|34.  omero~: Pronounced ^@omero~; the subject of
"carcava" in the following verse.  The object is "peccator" (also
vs. 6).

	|superbo~: "High," "haughty."

	|35-36.  carcava un peccator...nerbo~: The figure, as
Benvenuto observes, is that of a butcher carrying the carcass of
some animal to be skinned:

     Quod iste daemon portabat unum peccatorem in spatula, et
     corpus pendebat per renes cum capite deorsum, et diabolus
     cum unguibus suis tenebat eum ante per pedes, sicut recte
     macellarius portat animal iugulatum nigrum ad macellum ad
     excoriandum et vendendum ipsum.

     For this demon carried a sinner on his back, with the body
     hanging from the loins, head down.  In front, the devil held
     the sinner's feet with his claws, just as the butcher
     carries to the abattoir an animal with its throat cut, to
     have it skinned and to sell it.

	|35.  con ambo l'anche~: The sinner is slung over the
devil's shoulder like the carcass of a slaughtered
animal.

	|ghermito~: Suggests "gripped by claws," which is
literally true here, no doubt, since this devil is one of the
Malebranche, or "Evil-claws" (see vs. 37).

	|36.  nerbo~: The strong sinew just above the hoof, by
which butchers customarily hang or carry carcasses.

	|37.  Del~ = ^dal.        Malebranche~: "Evil-claws."  The
name suggests one of the more grotesque and terrifying features
of these devils.

	|38.  anzian~: M. Barbi (1934b, p. 210) cites the
unpublished commentary of Guido da Pisa, whose authority in this
case is to be respected: "In lingua tuscia rectores et
gubernatores populares anciani vocantur, ut est Pisis Pistorii et
Luce."  ("In the Tuscan language, the rectors and governors of the
people are called ^anziani~, just as they are in Pisa, Pistoia,
and Lucca.")  V. Capetti (1913, p. 59) states that the ^anziani~
were ten citizens, two from each division of the city, who held
office for two months.  The office of "elder" in Lucca thus
corresponded to the Florentine office of prior, in which Dante
himself served; and the sinner condemned to punishment in this
fifth ^bolgia~ of the eighth circle is guilty of corruption in
public office (barratry), the very charge made against Dante when
he was sentenced to exile.  (Barratry, the buying and selling of
public office, is the civil equivalent of simony, the buying and
selling of church office, the sin punished in the third
^bolgia.~)

	In the same gloss referred to above, Guido da Pisa
identifies the barrator in question as one Martino Bottaio, who
died in Lucca on the same day that Virgil and Dante in Hell
reached the ^bolgia~ of the barrators (see vss. 112-14 for the
exact time reference).  Barbi (1934b, p. 210) quotes Guido:

     Iste Martinus bottarius, qui propter peccatum baractarie hic
     ponitur ab auctore, fuit homo multum levis in moribus, sicut
     sunt omnes alii etiam sui cives.  Nam re vera omnes lucani
     comuniter stulti sunt et fatui reputantur.  Hic ergo
     Martinus adeo levis fuit quod cum quadam vice ad Romanam
     Curiam ex parte sui Comu nis ambaxiator ivisset, et una die
     cum papa Bonifatio in camera se multum iactasset, ait ad
     dominum Papam: ^Padre santo, crollami.~  Quod cum papa causa
     ioci et recreationis illum crollasset, inquit Martinus:
     ^Messa Lucca hai crollata.~

     This Martino Bottaio, who is placed here by the author
     because of his sin of barratry, was a very silly man, as are
     all his fellow citizens.  As a matter of fact, the Lucchese
     are generally very foolish, and are known to be fatuous.
     Once, this Martino was sent to the Roman ^curia~ as
     ambassador of his commune.  He was so silly that one day, at
     an audience with Pope Boniface at which he had boasted a
     great deal, he said: "Holy Father, shake me."  To go along
     with the joke, the pope shook him, whereupon Martino said:
     "You have just shaken half of Lucca."

	|38.  Santa Zita~: St. Zita (born 1218, died ^ca.~
1278), the patron saint of Lucca, is also the patron saint of
domestic servants, since she herself was a servant.  Her tomb is
in the church of San Frediano at Lucca (see the illustration
given by C. Ricci, 1921b, p. 212).

	|39.  per anche~: "Again," and, by implication, "for
another sinner," as is clear from what the devil goes on to say.
The implication that the sinners are carried directly down into
Hell from Lucca does not accord with the statement in ^Inf.~ III,
122-23 that all sinners first assemble at the river Acheron; but
we may at least imagine that the devil hauls his prey before
Minos for judgment (see ^Inf.~ V, 4-15) before bringing it to its
allotted place, according to that judge's sentence.

	|40.  terra~ = ^citt@a~, as elsewhere in the poem; here the
word refers to Lucca.

	|41.  fuor che Bonturo~: The jeering sarcasm of this
touch is evident.  Bonturo is actually the worst barrator of all;
and in Lucca every public official is corrupt, it seems

	|Bonturo~: Bonturo Dati, the head of the popular
party in Lucca at the beginning of the fourteenth century,
appears to have bought and sold public offices on so grand a
scale that he controlled nearly all such traffic in the city.
Benvenuto credits Bonturo with the remark to Boniface VIII that
Guido da Pisa imputes to Martino Bottaio (see n. to vs.  38), but
Guido's opinion is probably the more trustworthy in matters
concerning Lucca.  On Bonturo Dati see C. Minutoli (1865), pp.
211-20.

	|42.  del no, per li denar, vi si fa ita~: Buti comments:
"In Lucca...a chi d@e esser detto di no nelli offici @e detto di
s@i; et a chi non @a ragione @e fatto che l'abbia per li denari."
("In Lucca...those who should be told 'no' in certain offices are
told 'yes' and those who are in the wrong are made to be in the
right, through money.")

	|ita~: Latin adverb, meaning "in this manner," "just so."  As
M. Barbi points out (1934b, p.  273), its use in Italian as an
affirmative was not uncommon.  Cf. ^s@i~, from the Latin ^sic.~

	|44-45.  e mai non fu mastino...lo furo~: The devil is
intent on his next prey, another barrator back there in Lucca,
where barrators are so numerous that already another one has died
unrepentant.

	|45.  furo~: "Thief"; see ^Inf.~ XII, 90.

	|47.  ma i demon~: Finally the suspense generated by the
long simile of the Arsenal is resolved: there ^are~ guardians
here, after all.  The appearance of the creature who brought
Martino Bottaio has suggested that the guardians might be devils,
and now the true situation becomes clear.

	|demon~: Pronounced ^dem@on.~

	|48.  gridar~ = ^gridarono.~

	|Qui non ha loco il Santo Volto!~ The vulgar jeer is evident:
the sinner's rear end turns up, all black with pitch.

	|Santo Volto~:  The "Volto Santo" ("Sacred Face") of Lucca is
an ancient crucifix of great sanctity, carved in dark wood.  According
to tradition, this relic was carved by Nicodemus, who, while attempting
to portray the divine features, fell asleep and on awaking found the
work had been miraculously completed for him.  The story of how it was
transferred from the Holy Land to Lucca, where it is said to have been
deposited in 742, is told by Benvenuto, who concludes his account with
the remark, "Tu de hoc crede quod vis, quia hoc non est de articulis
fidei." ("You can believe whatever you like about that matter; it is
not an article of faith.")  Benvenuto states that the Lucchese were
accustomed to offer up prayers and oblations to the Volto Santo,
particularly when they were in trouble.  Its renown was such that even
the impious William Rufus is said to have been in the habit of swearing
by it.  It is still an object of veneration, and is preserved in the
nave of the cathedral of San Martino at Lucca, in a small marble chapel
known as the Tempietto.  For the legend itself, the miracles wrought by
the holy image, and a bibliography, see G. Fallani (1961), pp.
117-23.(See Plate 5.)

	|49.  si nuota altrimenti che nel Serchio~: Lana
comments: "La state comunemente ogni lucchese vi si bagna entro."
("In the summer all the Lucchese generally bathe
there.")

	|Serchio~: A river of Tuscany, which rises in the
Apennines of Lunigiana and flows south toward Lucca, a few miles
to the north of which it turns southwest and empties into the
Ligurian Sea between Viareggio and Pisa (it formerly joined the
Arno a short distance from its mouth).

	|51.  non far sopra la pegola soverchio~: This terrible
warning stresses the ^contrapasso~ aspect of the punishment:
those who sinned in barratry operated "under cover" and must
continue to do so here.

	|52.  addentar~ = ^addentarono~; literally, "bit
into."

	|raffi~: "Hooked spears."

	|53-54.  Coverto convien...accaffi~: The stress on
"undercover operation" continues, in the words "coverto,"
"nascosamente," and "accaffi."  The sharpest taunt lies in the
phrase "se puoi."

	|54.  accaffi~: "Seize," "hook," a meaning easily applied
to the activity of barratry.  On this word see E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 277.

	|55-57.  Non altrimenti i cuoci...non galli~: Porena
comments that Dante has in mind the huge kitchen -- equipped with
big kettles -- of a court or great noble house, where a cook
directs and supervises the work of many subordinates.  The whole
simile continues that of the butcher with his carcass (vss. 34-
36), the "meat" (vs. 57) now having been brought to "pot" (vs.
56).

	|55.  cuoci~ (archaic) = ^cuochi.~

	|vassalli~: "Kitchen boys."

	|58.  non si paia~ = ^non appaia, non apparisca.~

	|59.  t'acquatta~ = ^acquattati~, (pronounced
^acqu@attati~); "crouch," "squat down"; see "quatto quatto,"
vs. 89.

	|60.  dopo~ = ^dietro.~

	|scheggio~: Literally, "splinter," but here the word has the
meaning of "rocchio" (see ^Inf.~ XX, 25), a "jag" or "jutting rock" of
the rough reef.

	|aia~ = ^abbia.~

	|62.  i' ho le cose conte~: "I have things under control
here."

	|63.  altra volta~: Virgil may be referring to his
difficulties with the devils at the walls of Dis (see ^Inf.~
VIII, 82-130) or to some skirmish that he had with these devils
on his previous journey to lower Hell (see ^Inf.~ IX, 22-30).
The first meaning seems more probable and more significant, since
Virgil appears to forget that his difficulties before Dis were
solved not by himself but by a messenger from Heaven.  Hence
Virgil here exhibits the same self-confidence he showed in the
earlier encounter, before the devils shut the gate in his face.
^baratta~: "Skirmish," "wrangle"; see E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
277.  The term by its very form brings barratry (^baratter@ia~)
to mind; see ^Inf.~ XI, 60.

	|64.  di l@a dal co del ponte~: Virgil advances beyond
the far head of the bridge.  On the form "co," see n. to ^Inf.~
XX, 76.

	|65.  ripa sesta~: The wall dividing the fifth and sixth
^bolge.~

	|66.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|68.  ch'escono~ = ^con cui escono.~

	|69.  che di s@ubito chiede ove s'arresta~: When the dogs
rush out at him, the poor beggar ventures no nearer the house,
but asks for alms from where he has stopped, all fearful.
However, Virgil, neither suppliant nor frightened, gives a
command (vs. 72).  For another interpretation (but one that seems
less acceptable), see M. Barbi (1928).

	|74.  traggasi~ = ^si tragga.~

	|75.  e poi d'arruncigliarmi si consigli~: The subject of
"si consigli" could be "l'un di voi" in the preceding verse, but
probably the whole group of devils is intended, as though the
phrase read: "si consigli tra voi."  In that case, the verse as a
whole implies: "[After what I shall tell him,] then take counsel
[among yourselves] if I am to be gaffed."

	|76.  Malacoda~: "Evil-tail."

	|78.  Che li approda~ = ^che pro gli fa~: "What good will
it do him?"

	|approda~ = ^fa pro~; cf. the Latin ^prodesse.~
As Malacoda advances toward Virgil, he addresses his comrades
behind him, or perhaps only himself.

	|81-82.  sicuro gi@a...e fato destro~: The reference in
vs. 81, as in vs. 63 (see note), seems to be to the encounter at
the walls of Dis (^Inf.~ VIII, 82-130), where the devils (those
who had "rained down from Heaven," ^Inf.~ VIII, 83) put up their
most troublesome resistance (^schermo~).  But now Virgil, with
predictable effect, refers to the divine aid he was given in that
encounter.  The phrase "fato destro," in fact, seems to echo the
words "le fata" of ^Inf.~ IX, 97.

	|83.  Lascian'~ = ^lasciane~ (pronounced ^l@asciane, ne =
ci~).  Virgil's use of ^ne~ cannot be understood by the devils,
since they presumably have not yet seen his companion, who is
crouching behind a jut of rock (see vss. 58-60; 88-89).  The
reference to "altrui" in the following verse is equally obscure-
-deliberately so -- for the moment.

	|83-84.  Lascian' andar...silvestro~: Virgil's words here
are a variation on the formula of adjuration, "vuolsi cos@i col@a
...si vuole," that he had used in upper Hell when his passage was
challenged (see, for example, ^Inf.~ III, 95-96).

	|84.  silvestro~: See ^Inf.~ II, 142.

	|85.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|86.  si lasci@o cascar l'uncino a' piedi~: An effective
touch in the diabolical histrionics of this scene.

	|87.  Omai~: The little word, often so hard to translate,
has in it a touch of "Well, in that case!"

	|feruto~ = ^ferito.~

	|90.  omai~: See n. to vs. 87, above.

	|93.  temetti ch'ei tenesser~: Scartazzini-Vandelli
compares the Latin ^vereor ut.~

	|patto~: Here used primarily in the sense of "assurance,"
"promise."  Thus the Pisans, surrendering the fortress of Caprona and
being given assurance of safe-conduct, were "patteggiati" (vs. 95).
Here in vs. 93, "patto" refers to Malacoda's order (vs. 87): "Let no
one strike him."

	|95.  Caprona~: A castle in the territory of Pisa, about
five miles from that city, on a hill close to the Arno.  In
August 1289, shortly after the death of Count Ugolino, head of
the Guelph party in Pisa, and the expulsion of the Guelphs from
that city, the Tuscan Guelphs, headed by the Lucchese and
Florentines, invaded Pisan territory and captured several forts,
including that of Caprona, as Villani records (VII, 137):

     Nel detto anno 1289 del mese d'Agosto, i Lucchesi feciono
     oste sopra la citt@a di Pisa colla forza de' Fiorentini...e
     andarono insino alle porte di Pisa, e fecionvi i Lucchesi
     correre il palio per la loro festa di san Regolo, e
     guastarla intorno in venticinque d@i che vi stettono ad
     oste, e presono il castello di Caprona, e guastarlo....

     In the year 1289, in the month of August, the Lucchese, with
     the help of the Florentines, besieged Pisa...and while they
     were at the gates of Pisa, they celebrated their feast of
     San Regolo by playing the ^palio~ right there.  During the
     twenty-five days the siege lasted, they laid waste the
     surrounding countryside, and they took and destroyed the
     castle of Caprona.

Benvenuto states that Dante himself took part in the siege: "Et
hic nota quod autor fuit personaliter in isto exercitu; erat enim
tunc iuvenis viginti quinque annorum, et ibi vidit istum actum;
ideo libentius fecit talem comparationem, ut de se memoriam
faceret, quia aliquando tractaverat arma." ("And note here that
the author was in this army himself.  He was then a young man of
twenty-five, and there he witnessed this event.  All the more
willingly, then, did he make this comparison, to record the fact
that, at one time, he had borne arms.")  I. Del Lungo (1888, pp.
171-73) supports this view, on the ground that the campaign
against Ghibelline Pisa took place soon after the battle of
Campaldino (June 11, 1289), where Dante is known to have been.

	|98.  lungo~: See this usage in ^Inf.~ X, 53.

	|100.  Ei~ = ^essi.~

	|100-102.  Vuo' che 'l tocchi...accocchi~: The language
of the devils is as low and vulgar as their actions.

	|102.  rispondien~ = ^rispondevano.~

	|gliel'~ = ^gliele.~ ^Le~ is invariable and can represent ^lo,
li~, or ^la~; in this case it is ^la~, a form common to many idioms in
Italian.  Thus, ^accoccarla ad uno~ means "to let someone have it," "to
deal someone an ugly blow."

	|103.  quel demonio~: Malacoda.

	|tenea sermone~: "Was speaking" with Virgil.

	|105.  Posa, posa~: It is easy to imagine such a command
given to a watchdog: "Down, down!"

	|106-111.  Pi@u oltre andar...face~: As the reader learns
later (^Inf.~ XXIII, 133-44), Malacoda deliberately tricks
Virgil, but in this particular moment he is telling the truth:
the sixth bridge is indeed broken down. The fact that he declares
as much and does not simply point to the broken bridge ahead
implies that they cannot see the next bridge, either because the
bank on which they stand at the head of the fifth bridge is too
wide, or because it is too dark for them to see so far.

	|107.  iscoglio~ = ^scoglio~ (vs. III); one of the several
reefs which, like the spokes of a wheel, run from the surrounding
wall of the eighth circle across the whole series of ^bolge~
(except for the sixth, where at least the bridge ahead is broken
down).  See the earlier description, ^Inf.~ XVIII, 14-18; also
Fig. 6, p. 312.

	|110.  grotta~: Literally, "cliff"; see ^Inf.~ XIV, 114;
^Purg.~ I, 48.  Here in Canto XI "grotta" means the bank that
divides the fifth from the sixth ^bolgia.~

	|111.  presso~ = ^vicino.~

	|presso @e un altro scoglio che via face~: As it turns out, the
devil's lie is wholly in this verse, since actually ^all~ the bridges
over the sixth circle are broken down, as will be evident.

	|face~ = ^fa.~

	|112-114.  Ier, pi@u oltre cinqu' ore...fu rotta~: "Ier"
is the subject of "comp$ie" (vs. 114); the object is "anni" (vs.
114)./ See the latest time reference, ^Inf.~ XX, 124-29.  It was
then a little after six o'clock in the morning of the second day
of the journey; it is now seven o'clock in the morning.  On the
full symbolic and structural import of Malacoda's time-telling
and the connection with Christ's death on the cross, see C. S.
Singleton (1966).

	|112.  otta~ = ^ora.~

	|114.  la via fu rotta~: This breakdown of the rock
bridge obviously is related to the "ruina" of ^Inf.~ V, 34 and to
that of ^Inf.~ XII, 31-45, over which second ruin Virgil
marveled.  Like these two ^ruine~, the breakdown over the sixth
^bolgia~, referred to by Malacoda, occurred after Virgil's
previous journey to lower Hell, and consequently he is easily
deceived.  Virgil does know, however (see ^Inf.~ XII, 45), that
the rock of Hell collapsed at more than one point.

	|115-116.  Io mando...sciorina~: Malacoda states this as
if he had been intending all along to send a squad of devils on
just such a mission, but (as later becomes evident) this touch is
part of a ruse designed to trap the wayfarers.

	|116.  s'alcun se ne sciorina~: ^Sciorinare~ commonly
refers to the hanging out of clothes or other articles to dry;
hence the expression means: "If any is drying himself."

	|ne~: "Out" of the pitch.

	|117.  gite~ = ^andate.~

	|118.  Tra'ti~ = ^tr@aiti.~

	|118-123.  Alichino, e Calcabrina...Rubicante pazzo~: A
good deal has been written about the possible meaning of these
devils' names.  Some, like Malacoda, are obvious; others can only
be guessed at.  (See Torraca; E. G. Parodi, 1957, pp.  354-56; A.
Chiari, 1939, p. 20; L. Olschki, 1937, pp. 75-77; L. Spitzer,
1943, pp. 256-62; 1944.)

	|120.  la decina~: The squad is in fact a ^decuria~
(Latin for "decury," a division of ten men).  Later (^Inf.~ XXII,
74) Barbariccia, the leader, is termed "decurio" ("decurion," the
leader of a decury).

	|122.  sannuto~: "Tusked," i.e., "with ^sanne" (zanne~).

	|124.  boglienti~ = ^bollenti.~

	|pane~ = ^panie~ (pronounced ^p@anie~); see in ^Inf.~ XX, 9 the
similar form "letane" for ^letanie~ (pronounced ^let@anie~).  "Pane" is
"bird lime" or "glue"; see n. to vs. 18, above.

	|125-126.  costor sian salvi...tane~: This turns out to be
another example of Malacoda's deliberate treachery, and the other
devils know it.  Since all the bridges across the sixth ^bolgia~
are down, Malacoda is guaranteeing the wayfarers safe-conduct all
the way to -- nowhere!

	|128.  andianci~ = ^andiamoci.~  ^Ci~ has the function of
the pleonastic reflexive (see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94), setting off
the subject; here it is reinforced by "soli."

	|129.  se tu sa' ir~: The words look back to Virgil's
assurance (vs. 62) that he knows "about these things," and
perhaps to his earlier statement (^Inf.~ IX, 30) that he well
knows the way.

	|cheggio~ = ^chiedo.~

	|132.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|135.  li lessi~: "The stewed ones," the souls in the
boiling pitch.  The term continues the figure of vss. 55-57; see
also "i bolliti," ^Inf.~ XII, 102.

	|136.  Per l'argine sinistro~: The devilish squad turns
left (with respect to the direction of the wayfarers' advance)
along the far bank of the fifth ^bolgia.~

	|dienno~ = ^diedero.~

	|137-138.  la lingua stretta coi denti...per cenno~: The
grotesque gesture (one has only to imagine what snouts these
demons have) amounts to a "wink" of complicity and delight at the
prospect of the adventure ahead, in which the devils are going to
trick Virgil and Dante.

	|139.  elli avea del cul fatto trombetta~: The decurion's
answer amounts to a "Let's be off!" quite worthy of a devil.
