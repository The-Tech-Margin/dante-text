	|2.  per non dir pi@u~: "Having stopped speaking."  See
^Inf.~ XVI 101 for "per" meaning, as here, "on account of,"
"through."

	|sen gia~ = ^se ne giva (se ne andava~).

	|5.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|6.  uscia~ (pronounced ^usc@ia~) = usciva.~  See the
rhyme word ^ven@ia (= veniva~), vs. 4.

	|7-12.  Come 'l bue cicilian...trafitto~: The victims of
Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily, are said to have been
shut up and roasted alive in a brazen bull invented by the
Athenian artisan Perillus.  The contrivance was so fashioned that
the shrieks of those inside sounded like the bellowing of a bull.
According to legend, Perillus was the first to perish by his own
invention. Dante could have known the story from any of several
sources; it is told by Orosius (^Hist.~ I, xx, 1-4); Ovid
(^Tristia~ III, xi, 39-54 and ^Ars amat.~ I, 653-56); Pliny
(^Nat. hist.~ XXXIV, xix, 89); and Valerius Maximus (^Fact.
dict. memor.~ IX, ii, 9), whose account follows:

     Saevus etiam ille aenei tauri inventor, quo inclusi subditis
     ignibus longo et abdito cruciatu mugitus resonantem spiritum
     edere cogebantur, ne eiulatus eorum humano sono vocis
     expressi Phalaridis tyranni misericordiam implorare possent.
     quam quia calamitosis deesse voluit, taeterrimum artis suae
     opus primus inclusus merito auspicatus est.

     There was a savage fellow who invented a brazen bull in
     which victims were enclosed and a fire kindled beneath; they
     suffered a long and a hidden torture for he so arranged it
     that the moans that were torn from them sounded like the
     lowing of a bull, since if they sounded at all like human
     voices, they might plead for mercy from the tyrant,
     Phalaris.  Now, since he was so anxious to torment the
     unfortunate, the artisan himself was the first to experience
     the efficiency of his hideous invention.

	|7.  cicilian~ = ^siciliano~, as also "Cicilia" is used in
the poem for ^Sicilia.~

	|8.  e ci@o fu dritto~: See Ovid, ^Ars amat.~ I, 655-56:
"Iustus uterque fuit: neque enim lex aequior ulla est, / Quam
necis artifices arte perire sua."  ("Both were just; for there is
no juster law than that contrivers of death should perish by
their own contrivances.")  Pliny also describes Perillus'
punishment as "cruciatum eum iustiore saevitia" ("a cruelty more
just than the one he proposed").

	|12.  el~: The brazen bull.

	|pareva dal dolor trafitto~: See Ovid, ^Tristia~ III, xi, 48:
"Et veri vox erit illa bovis."  ("And that will be the voice of a true
bull.")

	|14.  dal principio~ = ^da principio~; "at
first."

	|in suo linguaggio~: Just as the shrieks of the victims roasted
alive in the brazen bull had no outlet and were thus incoherent, so the
voice of the shade enclosed within the flame at first has no outlet and
is indistinct.

	|17-18.  dandole...lor passaggio~: Giving to the tip of
the flame the movement made by the speaker's tongue as it uttered
the words.

	|quel guizzo che dato avea la lingua~: The expression is ^dare
un guizzo~, "to give a twist."

	|19-20.  udimmo dire...la voce~: The shade who begins to
speak here, who is never named, is the great Ghibelline leader
Guido da Montefeltro, nicknamed "the Fox."  Villani (VII, 80)
calls him "il pi@u sagace e il pi@u sottile uomo di guerra ch'al
suo tempo fosse in Italia" ("the shrewdest and finest soldier
that there was in Italy at that time") and (VII, 44) "savio e
sottile d'ingegno di guerra pi@u che niuno che fosse al suo
tempo" ("wise, possessing a more refined military talent than
anyone in his time").  Salimbene, the thirteenth-century
chronicler, calls him (vol. II, p. 224) "homo nobilis et sensatus
et discretus et morigeratus, liberalis et curialis et largus,
strenuus miles et probus in armis et doctus ad bellum" ("a
nobleman, intelligent, discreet, and gracious, generous, courtly,
and openhearted, and a very ardent soldier, able in arms and
versed in the art of war").

	Guido was born ^ca.~ 1220.  In June 1275, commanding a
combined force of Romagnole Ghibellines and exiled Ghibellines
from Bologna and Florence, he defeated a Guelph army led by
Malatesta da Rimini (Villani, VII, 48).  In September 1275, Guido
defeated the Guelphs at Reversano, near Cesena, and took
possession of Cesena, from which he expelled Malatesta da Rimini,
and of Cervia.  In 1282, he held Forl@i against the combined
French and Italian troops of Pope Martin IV, commanded by the
French knight and mercenary, Jean d'Eppes, on whom he inflicted
severe losses (see n. to vss. 43-44).

	The following year, however, Guido was driven out by the
inhabitants of Forl@i, who had come to terms with the pope, and
nearly all of Romagna submitted to the Church (Villani, VII, 80-
82).  In 1286 Guido himself made his submission to the new pope,
Honorius IV, and was reconciled to the Church but banished to
Piedmont (Villani, VII, 108).  Probably in March 1288, upon his
election as leader of the Pisan Ghibellines, he returned from
exile.  The pope punished this act of disobedience by
excommunicating Guido and his family and by laying Pisa, where
Count Ugolino had just been murdered, under an interdict
(Villani, VII, 128).  Under Guido's leadership, the Pisan
Ghibellines won several victories against the Florentine Guelphs;
but in 1293, when Florence and Pisa made peace, Guido was
dismissed (Villani, VIII, 2).

	In 1292 Guido made himself master of Urbino, which he
held against Malatestino da Rimini, at that time ^podest@a~ of
Cesena.  Shortly afterward, he was once more reconciled to the
Church, and late in 1296 he joined the Franciscan order.  It is
said that in 1298 Pope Boniface VIII induced Guido to advise him
how to reduce the stronghold of Palestrina, then held by the
Colonna family.  It is on the basis of this story -- whether real
or invented -- that Dante places Guido in the ^bolgia~ of the
fraudulent counselors (see n. to vs. 67).

	Guido died in September 1298 at the age of seventy-five.
According to some, he died and was buried in the Franciscan
monastery at Assisi.  Benvenuto, however, has a different
account; he says, with reference to Guido's supposed conversion:

     Dominus Malatesta, cum narraretur sibi a quodam familiari,
     quod comes Guido erat factus frater minor, respondit:
     caveamus ergo ne fieret guardianus Arimini.  ...devote
     assumpsit habitum, humiliter servavit regulam, et patienter
     tulit paupertatem; unde saepe visus est ire publice
     mendicando panem per Anconam, in qua mortuus est et
     sepultus; et multa audivi de eo, per quae poterat satis
     sperari de eius salute.

     When Dominus Malatesta was told by one of his entourage that
     Count Guido had become a Franciscan, he announced, "Let us
     beware lest he become the guardian of Rimini."...He assumed
     the monk's habit with sincerity, hewed to the clerical
     regimen with humility, and endured poverty patiently.  And
     so he could often be seen publicly begging for bread in the
     city of Ancona, where he died and was buried.  I have heard
     many things about him that would allow one to be of good
     hope for his salvation.

	|20.  che parlavi mo lombardo~: Strange as it may seem,
Virgil is said to have been speaking in the Lombard dialect to
Ulysses, and this serves to drop the pitch of the episode from
high tragedy to the everyday.  Most readers will come to this
with some surprise; but, as Grandgent comments, Dante believed
that the Italian dialects dated from antiquity and had always
existed simultaneously with Latin.  Hence Virgil, who came from
Lombardy, might appropriately enough speak his local dialect.(For
Virgil's Lombard origins, see ^Inf.~ I, 68-69.) B. Terracini
(1954, pp. 9-10) reviews the various interpretations of this
verse.

	|21.  dicendo "Istra ten va, pi@u non t'adizzo~": Guido
has evidently understood these parting words addressed to
Ulysses.  Hence Virgil's "lombardo" must indeed resemble
contemporary Lombard.

	|23.  restare~ = ^fermarti.~

	|24.  e ardo~: The value of "e" is that of Latin ^et~ in
the expression ^et tamen.~

	|25.  pur mo~: "Just now"; Guido's shade thinks it is
addressing one who has just fallen into Hell.

	|in questo mondo cieco~: Hell can always be so designated
because of its darkness, but in view of Guido's burning desire to know
about present conditions in his native Romagna and his evident
blindness to present events, the words take on special meaning.  In
^Inf.~ X, 58-59, Hell is called a "cieco carcere" for similar reasons.
On the "blindness" of all souls in Hell, see n. to ^Inf.~ X, 100-105.

	It is not clear whether the souls inside the flames can
see or not.  In this case Guido evidently does not see that the
wayfarer is present in the flesh.

	|27.  latina~ = ^italiana.~  See vs. 33; also ^Inf.~ XXII,
65.

	|28.  Romagnuoli~: For Romagna in general and the many
places referred to now, including Montefeltro, which is denoted
by the next two verses, see Map 3.

	|29.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|30.  e 'l giogo di che Tever si diserra~: The Apennines,
where the Tiber rises, at the foot of Mount Fumaiolo.

	|32.  mi tent@o di costa~: "Nudged my side"; see ^Inf.~
XII, 67.

	|33.  Parla tu; questi @e latino~: This plainly connects
with Virgil's speaking Lombard (vss. 20-21) and serves to drop
the pitch to something less than high tragedy.  Compare the
moment in the preceding canto when Virgil enjoined Dante not to
speak, since the souls there addressed were Greeks (see ^Inf.~
XXVI, 73-75)./ In ^Conv.~ IV, xxviii, 8, Dante calls Guido "lo
nobilissimo nostro latino" ("our most noble Italian").

	|36.  l@a gi@u~: The flame is obliged to stay down in the
"gullet of the ditch" (^Inf.~ XXVI, 40).

	|nascosta~: "Hidden" within the flame.

	|37.  mai~: Benvenuto comments: "Postquam coepit habere
tyrannos."  ("After which, it began to have tyrants.")

	|38.  tiranni~: The petty tyrants of Romagna seized rule
by force, generally without legitimate claim.  Machiavelli called
them "princes," of course.

	|39.  'n palese nessuna or vi lasciai~: At this time,
spring 1300, there was peace, or at least no open warfare, in
Romagna.  Torraca comments that after twenty-five years of
continuous war, in April 1299 the political parties, the tyrants,
and the communes agreed to a general and perpetual peace, which
apparently was still in force in 1300.

	|40-41.  Ravenna...l'aguglia da Polenta~: Polenta was a
castle near Brettinoro (modern Bertinoro), a few miles south of
Forl@i (see Map 3), from which the Guelph Polenta family took its
name.  The Polenta acquired authority over Ravenna toward the end
of the thirteenth century and relinquished it to Venice in 1441.
The head of the house at the time of which the wayfarer is
speaking was Guido da Polenta the elder (died 1310), father of
Francesca da Rimini, and grandfather of Guido Novello, Dante's
host at Ravenna in 1321.  The arms of the Polenta family
displayed an eagle, "half argent on a field azure, half gules on
a field or." Benvenuto says that Dante's metaphor implies, as was
the fact, that the rule of the Polenta was beneficent:

     Nunc autor descripturus specialiter statum Romandiolae,
     incipit a Ravenna, et sententialiter vult dicere, quod
     nobilis et antiqua prosapia istorum de Polenta dominatur
     Ravennae et Cerviae.  Unde debes scire, quod eo tempore
     regnabat Ravennae quidam dominus Guido Novellus de Polenta,
     vir quidem satis magnae intelligentiae et eloquentiae; qui
     multum honoravit Dantem in vita et in morte...ideo loquitur
     de eo valde honeste, describens ipsum ab insignio suae
     domus....Vult enim dicere, quod iste Guido Novellus fovet et
     protegit ravennates sub umbra alarum suarum, sicut aquila
     filios suos.  Et de rei veritate Ravenna tunc erat in
     florenti statu, quae nunc est in languido.

     Now the author, about to describe in detail the conditions
     in Romagna, begins at Ravenna, and he means to say,
     sententiously, that the noble and ancient race of these
     Polenta ruled in Ravenna and Cervia.  Now, you must know
     that in those days Ravenna was ruled by a certain Guido
     Novello da Polenta, a man of truly great intelligence and
     eloquence.  He honored Dante highly, both in life and in
     death...and Dante therefore speaks of him in the highest
     terms, describing him by reference to the escutcheon of his
     house....He means to say that this Guido Novello nourishes
     and protects the citizens of Ravenna under the shadow of his
     wings, just as the eagle does its young.  And in truth,
     Ravenna flourished in those days, whereas now it languishes.

	|41.  la si cova~ = ^se la cova.~

	|42.  Cervia~: Cervia, a town on the Adriatic, about
fourteen miles southeast of Ravenna, was a place of some
importance in the Middle Ages because of its salt monopoly, which
appears to have yielded a considerable revenue.  It had been
under the dominion of Ravenna for some years.  Benvenuto says:
"Habet haec civitas praerogativam salis; unde cardinalis
ostiensis dominus Bononiae et Romandiolae erat solitus dicere:
Plus habemus de Cerviola parvula, quam de tota Romandiola."
("This city had the monopoly on salt; wherefore the cardinal of
Ostia, lord of Bologna and Romagna, was wont to say, 'We receive
more from dear little Cervia than we do from all of Romagna.'")

	|43-44.  La terra...sanguinoso mucchio~: This is Forl@i,
of which Dante speaks in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ (I, xiv, 3) as the
central town of Romagna.  Under the direction of Guido da
Montefeltro (whose very shade the wayfarer is addressing, though
he does not know it yet), the city successfully withstood a
year-long siege laid by the French and Italian troops of Pope
Martin IV under Jean d'Eppes, who were finally repulsed with
heavy losses ("sanguinoso mucchio").  Villani says (VII, 81): "I
Franceschi e la gente della Chiesa ricevettono grande sconfitta e
dammaggio, e morirvi molti buoni cavalieri Franceschi."  ("The
French and the soldiers of the Church were roundly defeated and
suffered many casualties.  Many good French knights were
killed.") / We may imagine that Guido hears the wayfarer's
account with some satisfaction.

	|44.  Franceschi~ = ^francesi.~  The form was common in
early Italian.

	|sanguinoso mucchio~: On the meaning of this phrase, see F.
Torraca (1912), pp. 109-21.

	|45.  sotto le branche verdi~: The family thus designated
is the Ordelaffi, who in Dante's time ruled Forl@i.  Its
escutcheon bore on the upper half "on a field or a lion rampant
vert"; or, as the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ describes it, it was "uno
scudo dal mezzo in gi@u addogato, da indi in su uno mezzo leone
verde nel campo giallo" ("an escutcheon, the lower half divided
by vertical bands, and in the upper, a half lion vert on a field
or")./ It is probable that Dante was at Forl@i early in his years
of exile, in 1303, as aide and secretary to Scarpetta degli
Ordelaffi, who was head of the family at the time and leader of
the Bianchi forces there in 1302-3.

	|branche~: Here the word implies "paws" rather than "claws."

	|46.  'l mastin vecchio~: Malatesta da Verrucchio (died
1312), who, after defeating Montagna de' Parcitati and the
Ghibelline party of Rimini in 1295 (see n. to vs. 47), became the
first Malatesta lord of Rimini.  He retained the lordship until
his death at the age of one hundred.  Malatesta had four sons:
Malatestino, who succeeded his father as lord of Rimini in 1312;
Gianciotto, husband of Francesca da Rimini; Paolo, her lover; and
Pandolfo, who succeeded his eldest brother as lord of Rimini in
1317, since both Gianciotto and Paolo predeceased their father./
The family originally came from Montefeltro to Verrucchio, a
castle and village some ten miles southwest of Rimini, and from
that place took their name.

	|'l nuovo~: Malatestino, the "Young Mastiff," lord of Rimini
1312-17.

	|47.  Montagna~: Montagna de' Parcitati was head of the
Ghibelline party in Rimini.  When Malatesta overpowered Montagna
and the Ghibellines of the city in 1295, Montagna was taken
prisoner and entrusted to the charge of Malatestino.  Benvenuto
tells of Malatestino's harsh dealing with Montagna:

     Nobilis miles di Parcitatis de Arimino, princeps partis
     ghibellinae; quem captum cum quibusdam aliis Malatesta
     tradidit custodiendum Malatestino filio.  Postea petivit ab
     eo, quid factum esset de Montagna.  Cui iste respondit:
     Domine, est sub fida custodia; ita quod si vellet se
     suffocare, non posset, quamvis sit iuxta mare.  Et dum
     iterum et iterum peteret, et replicaret, dixit: Certe
     dubito, quod nescies ipsum custodire.  Malatestinus, notato
     verbo, fecit Montagnam mactari cum quibusdam aliis.  The
     noble knight of the Parcitati of Rimini, head of the
     Ghibelline faction, was captured together with some other
     men by Malatesta, who turned him over to his son
     Malatestino.  Later, the father asked him what he had done
     with Montagna, whereupon the son replied: "My lord, he is so
     well guarded that although he is near the sea, he could not
     drown himself even if he wanted to."  Malatesta, after
     several times making the same inquiry and receiving the same
     reply, at last said: "I see that you do not know how to
     guard him."  Malatestino, taking the hint, had Montagna and
     several others killed.

	|48.  l@a dove soglion~: At Rimini.

	|fan d'i denti succhio~: "They make an auger [^succhiello~] of
their teeth," -- i.e., they govern cruelly.  See Prov. 30:14:
"Generatio quae pro dentibus gladios habet, et commandit molaribus
suis, ut comedat inopes de terra, et pauperes ex hominibus."  ("There
is a group whose incisors are swords, whose teeth are knives, devouring
the needy from the earth, and the poor from among men.")

	|d'i = dei.~

	|49.  Le citt@a di Lamone e di Santerno~: Faenza,
nineteen miles southwest of Ravenna, is on the Lamone River; and
Imola, about twenty-one miles southeast of Bologna, is on the
Santerno River (see Map 3).

	|50.  il lioncel~: Maghinardo, or Mainardo, Pagano da
Susinana, head of the Pagani family in Dante's time, was lord of
Faenza in 1290, of Forl@i in 1291, and of Imola in 1296.  Dante's
designation of him as the "Little Lion" refers to his coat of
arms, "on a field argent a lion azure."  Maghinardo was also
called "the Demon" (see ^Purg.~  XIV, 118).  He died at Imola in
1302.

	|51.  che muta parte~: Although a Ghibelline by birth and
a staunch supporter of that party in Romagna, Maghinardo was
loyal to the Florentine Guelphs, in gratitude for the care they
had taken of him and his property when his father, at his death,
entrusted him to their protection as a minor.  Documents show
that the richest Florentine bankers later underwrote his
activities.  Instances of his political inconsistency are
numerous.  Villani gives the following account of him (VII, 149):

     Il detto Maghinardo fu uno grande e savio tiranno, e della
     contrada tra Casentino e Romagna grande castellano, e con
     molti fedeli; savio fu di guerra e bene avventuroso in pi@u
     battaglie, e al suo tempo fece grandi cose.  Ghibellino era
     di sua nazione e in sue opere, ma co' Fiorentini era guelfo
     e nimico di tutti i loro nimici, o guelfi o ghibellini che
     fossono; e in ogni oste e battaglia ch'e' Fiorentini
     facessono, mentre fu in vita, fu con sua gente a loro
     servigio, e capitano; e ci@o fu, che morto il padre, che
     Piero Pagano avea nome, grande gentile uomo, rimanendo il
     detto Maghinardo picciolo fanciullo e con molti nimici,
     conti Guidi, e Ubaldini, e altri signori di Romagna, il
     detto suo padre il lasci@o alla guardia e tuteria del popolo
     e comune di Firenze, lui e le sue terre; dal qual comune
     benignamente fu cresciuto, e guardato, e migliorato suo
     patrimonio, e per questa cagione era grato e fedelissimo al
     comune di Firenze in ogni sua bisogna.

     This Maghinardo was a great and wise tyrant, and a great
     chatelain in the region between Casentino and Romagna, where
     he had many faithful followers.  He knew a great deal about
     war, and had fought very boldly in many battles.  In his
     time he did great things.  He was a Ghibelline by birth and
     by deed; but with the Florentines he was a Guelph and the
     enemy of all their enemies, whether they were Guelphs or
     Ghibellines.  For as long as he lived, whenever the
     Florentines were engaged in a siege or a battle, he
     supported them with his troops, and served as their captain.
     And the reason was that at the death of his father, Piero
     Pagano, a great gentleman, Maghinardo was left a small boy
     among many enemies -- the Conti Guidi, the Ubaldini, and other
     lords of Romagna; wherefore his father left him and all his
     lands under the guardianship and tutelage of the people and
     the commune of Florence.  The commune raised him with gentle
     care, guarded him, and increased his patrimony; and for that
     reason, he was grateful and thoroughly faithful to the
     commune whenever it was in need.

Benvenuto, who copies Villani's account almost verbatim, says of
Maghinardo:

     Maghinardus Paganus...fuit nobilis castellanus in montibus
     supra Imolam; qui sua probitate et felicitate ex parvo
     castellano factus est magnus dominus in Romandiola, ita quod
     habuit tres civitates, scilicet Forlivium, Faventiam et
     Imolam.

     Maghinardo Pagano...was the noble lord of a castle in the
     mountains above Imola.  His probity and his good fortune
     caused him to rise from [the status of] a small chatelain to
     great lordship in Romagna, to the point where he had three
     cities under him, Forl@i, Faenza, and Imola.

	|52.  quella cu' il Savio bagna il fianco~: This is
Cesena, on the Savio River, midway between Forl@i and Rimini, at
the foot of the hills belonging to the Tuscan Apennine range (see
Map 3).

	|53.  cos@i com' ella sie' tra 'l piano e 'l monte~:
Torraca comments that although Cesena now is almost completely on
a plain, in Dante's time it rose toward the hills.  The Savio
River, which washed the base of these hills, also washed the edge
of the city.

	|sie'~ = ^siede.~

	|54.  tra tirannia si vive e stato franco~: Cesena
appears to have been to some extent a free municipality about the
time of which Dante is speaking (1300).  It was legally a free
commune but was bossed by Galasso da Montefeltro, Guido's cousin,
who was ^capitano del popolo~ from 1296 and ^podest@a~ from 1298
until his death in 1300, despite the fact that the office of
^podest@a~ normally changed every year.  Thus Cesena enjoyed more
freedom than the other cities Dante mentions; although it did not
enjoy self-government, it was not entirely in the hands of a
tyrant either.

	|si vive~: The pleonastic reflexive sets the subject off to
itself; see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94.

	|55.  che ne conte~: "That you tell us."

	|ne~ = ^ci.~

	|conse~ = ^conti.~

	|56.  altri~: The indefinite pronoun refers to Dante
himself; on this usage see M. Barbi (1920).

	|57.  se 'l nome tuo nel mondo tegna fronte~: For this
familiar formula of adjuration, see also, for example, ^Inf.~
X, 82.

	|tegna fronte~: Literally, "holds its head" high.

	|58-59.  'l foco...al modo suo~: See vss. 14-15.

	|60.  di@e cotal fiato~: "Gave forth this breath" -- i.e.,
spoke these words.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ IX, 584: "Linguaque vix
tales icto dedit aere voces."  ("And then with choked and feeble
utterance you spoke.")

	|61.  S'i' credesse~ = ^se io credessi.~

	|61-66.  S'i' credesse...ti rispondo~: These words follow
naturally upon Dante's entreaty based on Guido's enduring fame in
the world (see vss. 55-57); and Guido's pride in his fame is
evident (see vss. 77-78).  Even Vanni Fucci, "bestia" that he
was, could suffer embarrassment over being seen where he was in
Hell.

	|63.  staria~ = ^starebbe.~

	|67.  Io fui uom d'arme~: Did Dante invent the story that
is told now, or did he find it already recorded in some
contemporary chronicle?  No conclusive answer to the question has
been found.  Although it was long debated, chiefly by Francesco
D'Ovidio and Francesco Torraca, probably no definitive evidence
is forthcoming.  The whole matter hinges on whether the Ferrarese
chronicler Riccobaldo, writing before 1313, knew this canto of
the ^Inferno~ and based his account on it, or whether he wrote
independently.  In any case, Riccobaldo gives the story as
follows (quoted by E. G. Parodi, 1911b, p. 266):

     Erat eo tempore in ordine beati Francisci Guido qui, comes
     olim de Monte Feretro, dux fuerat bellorum pro Gibilinis.
     Hunc ad se vocavit papa Bonifacius.  Persuadet, ut dux belli
     sit contra cardinales adversos.  Cum omnino talia abnueret
     constanter, tum ait: -- Saltem me instruas quonam modo eos
     subigere valeam -- .  Tum ille: -- Multa promittite, pauca
     servate de promissis -- .

     At that time there was a Franciscan named Guido, a former
     count of Montefeltro, who was a general of the Ghibellines.
     Pope Boniface called him in and urged him to become leader
     in the war against the rebellious cardinals.  And when he
     persisted in refusing to have any part in it, the pope said,
     "At least you can advise me how to get the better of them."
     To which Guido replied: "Promise much but fulfill little
     that you promise."

Clearly Dante learned of Guido's fraudulent counsel after he had
written of him so glowingly in the ^Convivio~ (see the quotation
in n. to vs. 33, above).  The story is also told by Francesco
Pipino, a Bolognese chronicler who wrote shortly after
Riccobaldo.  For the controversy in detail, see E. G. Parodi
(1911b); Porena, "Nota finale," pp. 245-46; F. Torraca (1912),
pp. 305-46; F. D'Ovidio (1901), pp.  27-75.  For the
corresponding version of Francesco Pipino and for the relation of
the two chroniclers, see A. F.  Mass@era (1915); G. Petraglione
(1903).

	|69.  ven@ia~ = ^veniva~, a common use of the imperfect
tense for the conditional perfect; hence "ven@ia" ^= sarebbe
venuto.~

	|70.  se non fosse~ = ^se non fosse stato.

	|il gran prete~: Boniface VIII.  The phrase is derisive and
sarcastic.

	|71.  ne le prime colpe~: "In the old ruses," stratagems,
the "coperte vie" of vs. 76.

	|72.  quare~: Latin, "why."

	|73-74.  Sentre ch'io forma fui...madre mi di@e~: The
soul speaks in keeping with scholastic doctrine, which held that
the soul is the form of the body ("of the flesh and bones the
mother gave me"); see n. to ^Inf.~ VI, 106-7.

	|74-75.  l'opere mie...leonine, ma di volpe~: See Cicero,
^De officiis~ (I, xiii, 41), for the metaphor of the lion and the
fox.  On force of fraud as distinguishing elements in the sins of
malice punished in lower Hell, see n. to ^Inf.~ XI, 23-24.  If
Guido's deeds had been "leonine" -- that is, sins of violence -- he
would have fallen instead to the seventh circle of Hell./   The
anonymous ^Cronica di Pisa~ (col. 981C) relates: "Quando il detto
Conte Guido usciva fuore di Pisa con la gente, sonandoli innanzi
una Cennamella, li Fiorentini fuggiano e diceano: ^ecco la
Volpe.~"  ("When this count went forth from Pisa with his troops,
with the bagpipes playing before them, the Florentines fled,
saying: 'Here comes the Fox.")

	|78.  al fine de la terra il suono uscie~: See Ps. 18:5
[19:4]: "In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, et in fines orbis
terrae verba eorum."  ("Through all the earth their voice
resounds, and to the ends of the world, their
message.")

	|uscie~ = ^usc@i.~

	|79-80.  quella parte di mia etade~: Old age.  Dante also
speaks of Guido in the context of old age in ^Conv.~ IV, xxviii,
8.

	|81.  calar le vele e raccoglier le sarte~: In ^Conv.~
IV, xxviii, 8, as here, Dante uses a nautical metaphor to
describe old age; here it calls to mind that other voyager,
Ulysses, who with his companions was old and slow when he reached
the western limits of the inhabited world (see ^Inf.~ XXVI,
106-8).  Unlike Guido, Ulysses sailed forth on unknown seas.
Horace uses a similar metaphor in the ^Odes~ (I, xxxiv, 3-5):
"Nunc retrorsum / vela dare atque iterare cursus / cogor
relictos."  ("[I] am now compelled to spread my sails for the
voyage back, and to retrace the course I had abandoned.")

	|83.  pentuto e confesso mi rendei~: The ^Anonimo
fiorentino~, commenting on vs. 43, says: "Pentutosi et
confessatosi, si arrend@e a Dio."  ("Having repented and
confessed, he surrendered to God.")  See ^Purg.~ XX, 54, where
"un renduto" denotes a monk.

	|85.  Lo principe d'i novi Farisei~: Boniface VIII.  The
word "principe" is used ambiguously.  As pope, Boniface was chief
among the cardinals and other ecclesiastics, here termed the "new
Pharisees," of the Catholic Church; he was also, in Dante's view,
the greatest Pharisee of all.

	|d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|86.  guerra presso a Laterano~: The war between Boniface
VIII and the Colonna family and faction, who contested the
validity of the abdication of Celestine V (see n. to ^Inf.~ III,
59-60) and charged that Boniface had entered the papacy by fraud.
The struggle existed throughout Boniface's reign but came to a
head in 1297, when it appears that Stefano Colonna stole part of
the papal treasure.  The pope in consequence (in May 1297)
deprived the two Colonna cardinals, Jacopo and Pietro, of their
rank, excommunicated them and the rest of their house, and
demanded the surrender of certain castles.  The Colonna left Rome
and openly defied Boniface from their stronghold at Palestrina,
not far from the city, where they held out against the papal
forces until September 1298.

	|presso a Laterano~: Refers to the Colonna stronghold.
Palestrina is twenty miles southeast of Rome; see n. to vs. 102.
|Laterano~: In Dante's day "Laterano" was equivalent to the modern
"Vaticano," since the Lateran palace was the usual residence of the
pope."Laterano" is used here to denote Rome.

	|89.  e nessun era stato a vincer Acri~: Acre (French,
Saint-Jean-d'Acre, called Accho in the Old Testament and Ptolema,is
in the New Testament), now a city and seaport of Israel, is
situated on a low promontory of Mount Carmel on the northern
extremity of the Bay of Acre.  It is about eighty miles northwest
of Jerusalem and twenty-seven miles south of Tyre.  After having
been in the possession of the Saracens since the middle of the
seventh century (638), Acre was taken in 1104 by the crusaders
under Baldwin I, who made it their principal port and retained it
until 1187, when it was recovered by Saladin. In 1191, after a
long siege, it was retaken by Philip Augustus of France and
Richard Coeur de Lion, who gave the town to the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem, from whom it received the name of Saint-Jean-
d'Acre.  It remained in the possession of the Christians for a
hundred years and, in spite of frequent Saracen attacks, grew
into a large and populous city, protected on the land side by a
double line of fortifications.  In the spring of 1291, however,
it was besieged by the Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil because Christian
mercenaries within the city had violated a truce with the
Saracens.  After holding out for a few weeks, the city was taken
by assault.  With the defeat of Acre, the last of the Christian
possessions in the Holy Land reverted to the Saracens, and the
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem came to an end.

	|90.  n$e mercatante in terra di Soldano~: On receiving
news of the fall of Acre, Pope Nicholas IV at once attempted to
organize a crusade for the recovery of the city and called on all
Christians under pain of excommunication to abstain from any
further commerce with Egypt, the seat of Moslem power.

	|92.  quel capestro~: The Franciscan girdle or "corda"
(see vs. 67).

	|93.  che solea fare i suoi cinti pi@u macri~: Many times
Dante deplores the decline and corruption of religious orders.

	|94.  Ma come Costantin chiese Silvestro~: The legend of
Constantine's conversion by Sylvester I (pope 314-35) is narrated
by Jacobus de Varagine (or Voragine), archbishop of Genoa 1292-
98, in his ^Legenda aurea~ XII, 2-3.  According to this account,
Constantine, stricken with leprosy in punishment for persecuting
Christians, was advised by the heathen priests to wash himself in
a bath of infants' blood.  Three thousand infants were collected,
but Constantine was touched by the lamentations and prayers of
the mothers and ordered the children to be restored to their
parents, saying that it was better for him to die than to
sacrifice so many innocent lives.  The same night St.  Peter and
St. Paul appeared to him in a vision and told him to send for
Sylvester, who had taken refuge in a cave on Mount Soracte.
Constantine did as he was bidden and after receiving baptism at
Sylvester's hands was immediately cured; he then determined to
convert his mother Helena and finally succeeded in bringing her
and all of Rome to Christianity.  Other accounts add that
Constantine, to prove his gratitude still further and to leave
the Church completely at liberty, bestowed upon Pope Sylvester
the city of Rome and his temporal power in the West.  As the
legend goes, he then retired to Byzantium, which he rebuilt and
renamed Constantinople.  This story, widely accepted in the
Middle Ages, later proved baseless.  On the so-called Donation of
Constantine, see n. to ^Inf.~ XIX, 116.  G. Fallani (1958)
comments on the legend of Constantine and its iconography.

	|95.  Siratti~: Soracte (in medieval Latin, ^Siraptis~),
a mountain near the Tiber about twenty-four miles north of Rome,
where Pope Sylvester I is said to have taken refuge in a cave
during the persecutions of Constantine.  On its summit now stands
the church of San Silvestro.

	|95.  guerir~ = ^guarire.~

	|lebbre~ = ^lebbra~; for this form see E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
244.

	|96.  maestro~: The title for a physician.

	|98.  domandommi~ = ^mi domand@o.~

	|99.  ebbre~: The pope seemed "drunken," "raving," to be
asking a corded friar for such counsel.

	|100.  ridisse~: "Went on to say."

	|Tuo cuor non sospetti~: "Let your heart not mistrust," "have
no fear."  The specific reassurance is then given in vs. 103.

	|101.  finor~ = ^fin da ora.~  This is a most important
point, for the word means that absolution is given in
advance.  "Finor" also anticipates that the counsel requested will
be fraudulent and therefore sinful.

	|t'assolvo~: The formal words of absolution in Latin are "Ego
te absolvo."

	|e tu m'insegna~ = ^e tu insegnami~ (imperative); "e" has the
value of "and now," "in return."

	|102.  Penestrino~: The ancient Praeneste, now
Palestrina, a town situated on a steep hill about twenty miles
southeast of Rome.  It was the stronghold of the Colonna, who
managed to hold out there against the papal forces until
September 1298, when it was surrendered on a promise from the
pope of complete amnesty (the "lunga promessa" of vs. 110).  No
sooner did Boniface get possession of Palestrina than he raised
it to the ground (see "l'attender corto," vs.  110).  For
Villani's account, see VIII, 23, quoted in n. to vs. 110.

	|103-104.  Lo ciel poss' io...chiavi~: See Matt. 16:19: "Et
tibi dabo claves regni caelorum; et quodcumque ligaveris super
terram, erit ligatum et in caelis; et quodcumque solveris super
terram, erit solutum et in caelis."  ("And I will give thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.")  See also ^De mon.~ III, viii.

	|105.  che 'l mio antecessor non ebbe care~: It was
commonly believed that Pope Celestine V was induced to make "the
great refusal" by Benedetto Caetani, who then succeeded him as
Pope Boniface VIII (see n. to ^Inf.~ III, 59-60).  The words, in
the light of this belief, are cynical and ironical in the
extreme.

	|106.  pinser~ = ^spinsero.~

	|argomenti gravi~: The pope argues from his own authority,
delegated to him by Christ; Guido finds these arguments weighty, for,
as a corded friar, he is bound by an oath of obedience to higher
authority.

	|107.  l@a 've~ = ^l@a ove.~

	|'l tacer mi fu avviso 'l peggio~: As a Franciscan, bound by
oath to strict obedience, Guido would have good reason to fear the
wrath of Boniface if he did not yield to the latter's request (see
^Par.~ IV, 109-11).  Not to obey seems a worse sin than giving false
counsel, though by his words Guido clearly admits to an awareness that
in giving the counsel requested he will be committing a grave sin, and
he declares as much in the following verses.  Benvenuto observes:  "Sic
comes, dum nititur se excusare, accusat; quia voluit potius contra
conscientiam complacere Bonifacio, quam displicere illi pro salute
animae suae."  ("And thus the count, in trying to excuse himself,
accuses himself.  For he would rather please Boniface against his
conscience than displease him for the good of his soul.")

	|108.  da che~ = ^poich@e.~

	|mi lavi~: See Ps. 50:4 [51:2]: "Amplius lava me ab iniquitate
mea, et a peccato meo munda me."  ("Thoroughly wash me from my guilt
and of my sin cleanse me.")

	|109.  di quel peccato ov' io mo cader deggio~: "Since
you wash me of that sin which I must now incur."  Guido consents
to sin on the assurance that he is absolved in advance.

	|mo cader deggio~: Guido solemnly repeats the conditions of the
pact, and in so doing shows his confidence in its full validity; for
this reason he never bothered later to repent.

	|110.  lunga promessa con l'attender corto~: An account
of the pope's treachery at Palestrina is given by Villani (VIII,
23):

     Nel detto anno del mese di Settembre, essendo trattato
     d'accordo da papa Bonifazio a' Colonnesi, i detti Colonnesi
     cherici e laici vennero a Rieti ov'era la corte, e gittarsi
     a pi@e del detto papa alla misericordia, il quale perdon@o
     loro...ma fece disfare la detta citt@a di Pilestrino del
     poggio e fortezze ov'era, a fecene rifare una terra al
     piano, alla quale puose nome Civita Papale; e tutto questo
     trattato falso e frodolente fece il papa per consiglio del
     conte da Montefeltro, allora frate minore, ove gli disse la
     mala parola: ^lunga promessa coll'attender corto.~

     In the same year, in the month of September, Pope Boniface
     offered peace terms to the Colonna.  Members of that family,
     both priests and laymen, came to the papal court at Rieti to
     throw themselves at the pope's feet and ask for mercy.  He
     forgave them...but he had the city of Palestrina, which was
     strongly fortified on top of a hill, destroyed and had it
     rebuilt on the plain and called it Citt@a Papale.  The pope
     committed all these false and fraudulent acts on the advice
     of the count of Montefeltro, who was then a Franciscan, and
     who spoke the evil words, "a long promise and a short
     fulfillment."

It is possible that Villani took the words "lunga promessa
coll'attender corto" from Dante and that they do not represent
an independent view.  On the historicity of the incident, see n.
to vs. 67.

	|attender~: G. Manuzzi (1859, p. 364), under the entry
"attender," par. 16, gives another example of this meaning: "Il
castello s'arrend@e a patti, salve le persone, i quali non furono loro
attesi."  ("The castle surrendered on the condition that the people not
be harmed; and the condition was not observed.")

	|111.  ne l'alto seggio~: "On your lofty throne."

	|112.  Francesco venne poi~: The transition is the more
effective for being so abrupt.  Guido in fact did die in
September 1298, the month in which Boniface tricked the Colonna./
St.  Francis, in coming for one of his order, replaces the angel
that sometimes comes to struggle against a devil for the
possession of a soul; see ^Purg.~ V, 104.

	|113.  un d'i neri cherubini~: See the reference to
"angeli neri" in ^Inf.~ XXIII, 131; but Dante may well have
chosen one of the fallen cherubim in particular, since (according
to Pseudo-Dionysus) among the nine orders of angels they are
second in rank and the most learned, and even a fallen cherub
presumably would keep some of this special power.  Thomas Aquinas
(^Summa theol.~ I, q. 63, a. 7, ad 1) says: "Cherubim
interpretatur ^plenitudo scientiae.~" ("Cherubim is interpreted
^fulness of knowledge.~") See also ^Par.~ XI, 38-39.~

	|d'i = dei.~

	|114  li~ = ^gli.~

	|Non portar~ = ^non lo portar~; the omission of the object with
the imperative form of the verb is common in early Italian.

	|115.  Venir se ne dee~ = ^se ne deve venire.~

	|117.  dal quale~ = ^dal quale consiglio. in qua~: "Down
to this moment."

	|stato li sono a' crini~: The cherub has been waiting to seize
him the moment he died.

	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|118-120.  ch'assolver...per la contradizion~: "He cannot
be absolved [of a sin] who does not repent [of it]."  To repent
is to will not to do.  Hence it is not possible to repent in
advance of a sin which one is about to commit willingly.
Nevertheless, Guido, thinking himself absolved, never bethought
himself to repent later.

	|118.  ch'~ = ^ch@e~ in the sense of ^perch@e.~

	|assolver non si pu@o~: This impersonal construction may be
taken passively: "He may not be absolved."  The subject is "chi non si
pente."

	|si pente~: From ^pentirsi~, "to repent."  See ^De~ ^mon.~
III, viii, 7: "Unde cum dicitur `quodcunque ligaveris,' si illud
'quodcunque' sumeretur absolute, verum esset quod dicunt....Posset
etiam solvere me non penitentem: quod etiam facere ipse Deus non
posset."  ("Wherefore when it is said `Whatsoever thou hast bound,'
if this `whatsoever' were to be taken absolutely their contention
would be true....He would also be able to absolve me while I am not
penitent, which even God himself could not do.")

	|119.  pentere~: Pronounced ^pent@ere~; archaic for
^pentire~ (from the Latin ^paenitere~).

	|puossi~ = ^si pu@o~, impersonal.

	|121.  mi riscossi~: "I awakened with a start."  See
^Inf.~ IV, 2.  Only now does Guido realize how he erred by
believing in the fraudulent absolution promised by Boniface.  He
knows that the charge against him is valid: he has given false
counsel and has never repented.

	|123.  io loico~: The expressed subject pronoun is
emphatic.

	|loico~ = ^logico.~

	|124.  Min@os~: For Minos' role in Hell, see ^Inf.~ V,
4-12.

	|125.  otto volte~: Thus sentencing him to the eighth
circle of Hell.

	|126.  per gran rabbia la si morse~: For this
characteristic expression of wrath, see the descriptions of
Filippo Argenti turning upon himself with his teeth (^Inf.~ VIII,
61-63) and of the Minotaur gnawing himself (^Inf.~ XII, 14).  See
also Giotto's conception of ^Ira~ (Plate 6, facing p. 502).

	|127.  Questi @e d'i rei del foco furo~: These words
condemn the soul to the eighth ^bolgia.~

	|d'i~ = dei.~

	|foco furo~: See ^Inf.~ XXVI, 41-42: "il furto...invola."

	|128.  per ch'~: "For which reason," i.e., for which sin
and for which judgment against me [I am damned].

	|129.  s@i vestito~: With the flame that encloses
him.

	|mi rancuro~ = ^mi dolgo~, but with the suggestion of
bitter remorse, thereby throwing into relief the great contrast
between his suffering and that of Ulysses.

	|131-132.  la fiamma dolorando...aguto~: Ulysses' flame no
longer waved as in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 86, but became "erect and still"
(vs. 1) after he told his tale; Guido's flame goes off as it
came, "grieving...twisting and tossing its sharp horn."

	|131.  partio~ = ^part@i.~

	|135.  'l fosso~: The ninth ^bolgia.~

	|il fio~: "That which is due," the penalty.

	|136.  scommettendo~: The opposite of ^commettendo~
("putting together").

	|acquistan carco~: "Take on their burden" of guilt.
