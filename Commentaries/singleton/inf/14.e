	|1-3.  Poi che la carit@a...fioco~: A parting gesture of
piety that is almost ritualistic.  That the first-person
protagonist is a Florentine has already been made clear in his
encounters with Ciacco (^Inf.~ VI, 49-52) and Farinata (^Inf.~ X,
22-27).  Dante's love for his native city emerges most poignantly
again later.  See ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, vi, 3: "Florentiam adeo
diligamus ut quia dileximus exilium patiamur iniuste" ("though we
love Florence so dearly that for the love we bore her we are
wrongfully suffering exile").

	|2.  mi strinse~: See ^Aen.~ IX, 294: "Animum patriae
strinxit pietatis imago."  ("The picture of filial love touched
his soul.")  Also see ^Inf.~ V, 128: "come amor lo strinse."

	|raunai~ = ^radunai.~

	|3.  rende'le~ = ^le rendei.

	|ch'era gi@a foco~: Earlier the bleeding of the branch choked
the passage of the voice (see n. to ^Inf.~ XIII, 91).  Now the
momentary healing of the wound, the clotting of the blood, makes the
voice "faint." On "fioco" in this sense, see n. to ^Inf.~ I, 63.

	|4.  fine~ = ^confine.~

	|si parte~ = ^si divide.~

	|6.  di giustizia orribil arte~: The rain of fire of vss.
28-30, called the "vendetta di Dio" in vs. 16.  God is the maker
of this as of all other punishments in Hell.  The words "orribil
arte" echo the "orribil sabbione" of ^Inf.~ XIII, 19.

	|7.  cose nove~: "Things never seen before," "strange
things." See ^Inf.~ VII, 20, for "novo" in the sense of
"strange," as it is frequently used in the poem.

	|8-11.  dico che arrivammo...ad essa~: Compare these
verses, which provide a comprehensive view of the whole of the
seventh circle, with ^Inf.~ XII, 139 and ^Inf.~ XIII, 1-2.  For
the significance of such backward glances, see n. to ^Inf.~ XII,
139.

	|8.  landa~: A "plain," sometimes a clearing in a wood.

	|9.  che dal suo letto ogne pianta rimove~: The verse
focuses on the ^contrapasso~, or retributive, aspect of the
torments.  Sodomy, one of the three sins punished here, seems to
have determined the mode of punishment.  As sodomy is a denial of
and an offense against nature, so the plain is said to reject all
natural growth.  "Letto" is used here in the sense of "suolo."  In
writing this passage (especially vss. 89 and 13-15), Dante
evidently borrowed much from the description of the Libyan desert
in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ (IX, 431-37):

     At, quaecumque vagam Syrtim conplectitur ora
     Sub nimio proiecta die, vicina perusti
     Aetheris, exurit messes et pulvere Bacchum
     Enecat et nulla putris radice tenetur.
     Temperies vitalis abest, et nulla sub illa
     Cura Iovis terra est; natura deside torpet
     Orbis et inmotis annum non sentit harenis.

     But all that coast which surrounds the shifting Syrtis, as
     it lies flat under the scorching sun and near the parched
     sky, burns up corn-crops and smothers the vine with dust;
     and the powdery soil is bound together by no roots of
     plants.  The temperate air that life needs is not found
     there, and Jupiter pays no heed to the land; Nature is
     inactive; the lifeless expanse, with sands that are never
     ploughed, is unconscious of the seasons.

	|12.  a randa a randa~: "Randa" derives from the German
^Rand.~  I. Del Lungo (1906 p. 82) points out that though the
phrase "a randa" is unfamiliar to the modern ear, it was very
much a part of Florentine idiom as late as 1600.

	|13.  spazzo~ = ^spazio~ (Latin ^spatium~), but with a
difference of meaning.  Sapegno calls attention to Vincenzo
Borghini's explanation of the two words.  See Borghini, "Errori,"
p. 248: "Noi abbiamo ^spazio~ e ^spazzo~: diversi di dire e di
significato; il primo importa ^intervallum~, il secondo ^solum."~
("We have ^spazio~ and ^spazzo~, different in sound and in
significance: the first means ^intervallum~ [interval]; the
second ^solum~ [ground].")  See also the passage from Lucan
quoted in n. to vs. 9.

	|14.  colei~: The "rena" of vs. 13.  On this use of the
pronoun (nowadays a personal pronoun only) to refer to an
inanimate object, see E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 250, n. 93.

	|15.  Caton~: Cato the Younger of Utica (95-46 B.C.),
whose march through the Libyan desert shortly before his death is
recounted in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ (IX, 371-410).  See also n. to
vs. 9.

	|16.  vendetta di Dio~: The justice (vs. 6) meted out by
a wrathful God to whom violence has been done, directly or
indirectly (see ^Inf.~ XI, 46-48 and n. to vs. 48), by those who
are punished in this circle.

	|dei~ = ^devi.~

	|19.  anime nude~: Although all souls in Hell are nude
(except the hypocrites of ^Inf.~ XXIII), Dante mentions the fact
whenever he wishes to point up a particular great torment that is
increased by a soul's going naked.  See also, for example, ^Inf.~
XIII, 115-16.

	|gregge~: Plural of ^greggia~, "herd."

	|21.  diversa legge~: This phrase refers to the different
postures of the souls under the rain of fire, as the following
tercet makes clear.

	|22.  Supin~ = ^supino.~  The adjective is used for the
adverb.

	|22-24.  Supin giacea...sedea...andava...~: Each verse of
the tercet refers to one of the three groups mentioned in ^Inf.~
XI, 49-51 -- blasphemers, usurers, and sodomites.

	|24.  contin,uamente~: The diaeresis is very effective.

	|25-27.  Quella che giva...sciolta~: The tercet narrows
the focus to two of the three groups: those who run, the
sodomites; and those who lie on their backs, the blasphemers.
These are dealt with first.

	|pi@u molta~ = ^pi@u numerosa~; the sodomites are said to
outnumber the others.

	|27.  ma pi@u al duolo avea la lingua sciolta~: The
blasphemers, being those sinners guilty of the gravest sin in
this whole seventh circle -- a direct offense to God -- endure the
most pain. The ^contrapasso~ aspect of their torment is thus
apparent in their supine position, for when they uttered their
blasphemies they presumably turned their faces toward Heaven, and
now as they utter their laments they hold their faces turned the
same way, while God's punishing fire falls upon them.

	|28-29.  Sovra tutto 'l sabbion...falde~: The rain of
fire is plainly reminiscent of the fire which fell upon Sodom and
Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24): "Dominus pluit super Sodomam et Gomorrham
sulphur et ignem a Domino de caelo." ("The Lord poured down on
Sodom and Gomorra sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.")
See also Ezech. 38:22: Ignem et sulphur pluam super eum."  ("I
will rain fire and brimstone upon him.")

	|30.  come di neve in alpe sanza vento~: This extremely
effective verse seems to echo Guido Cavalcanti's "e bianca neve
scender senza venti" ("and white snow falling without winds"),
from his sonnet beginning "Bilt@a di donna" (in G. Contini,
1960, vol. II, p. 494, vs. 6), which names things pleasant to
behold.  For the rain of fire "like snow," see the quotation from
Albertus Magnus in n. to vss. 31-36.

	|alpe~: Dante frequently uses the word for "mountains" in a
general sense.

	|31.  Quali~: Modifies "fiamme" (vs. 33).  ^Alessandro~:
See n. to ^Inf.~ XII, 107.

	|31-36.  Quali Alessandro...solo~: Dante's source for
this story probably was the apocryphal ^Epistola Alexandri ad~
^Aristotelem, magistrum suum, de itinere suo et de situ~
^Indiae~, a Latin version of a work by an unknown Greek author
commonly referred to as Pseudo-Callisthenes.  There is, however,
a notable discrepancy between the two accounts, in that Dante has
Alexander bid his soldiers trample the flames, whereas in the
^Epistola Alexandri~ (p. 208) they are bidden to trample the
snow:

     Nam et flatus Euri ceciderat et frigus ingens vespertino
     tempore accrescebat.  Cadere mox in modum vellerum immensae
     coeperunt nives.  Quarum aggeratione metuens ne castra
     cumularentur, calcare militem nivem iubebam, ut quam primum
     iniuria pedum tabesceret....

     For the southeast wind had fallen, and toward evening the
     great cold became worse.  Very soon, large flakes of snow
     began to fall, like flakes of lamb's wool.  Fearing that the
     camp might be buried under the heavy snowfall, I ordered my
     soldiers to trample the snow, so that it would melt as
     quickly as possible under the blows of their feet.

A similar account is given in the abridged Latin version -- by the
Archpriest Leo -- of Pseudo-Callisthenes, commonly known as the
^Historia de preliis.~  Yet another version, in elegiacs,
composed in 1236 by Quilichinus de Spoleto, had been popular in
Italy more than sixty years before the date of the ^Commedia.~

	The commentators have assumed that Dante relied on his
memory of the ^Epistola Alexandri~ and thus confused the details
of the story.  The immediate -- though secondary -- source of his
description, however, was almost certainly a passage in the ^De
meteoris~ of Albertus Magnus (a book with which Dante was well
acquainted), who, owing to a misquotation of the ^Epistola
Alexandri~, is guilty of precisely the same confusion as to the
trampling of the flames as is Dante.  Albertus mentions the
incident of Alexander in India as an illustration of the
occurrence of igneous vapors (the same term used by Dante in vs.
35 to describe the fiery downpour), the origin and nature of
which he has been discussing (^De meteoris~ I, iv, 8):
"Admirabilem autem impressionem scribit Alexander ad Aristotelem
in epistola de mirabilibus Indiae, dicens: `Quemadmodum nivis
nubes ignitae de aere cadebant, quas ipse militibus calcare
praecepit.'"  ("Moreover, Alexander gives a remarkable
description of it in a letter on the Wonders of India addressed
to Aristotle.  He says: `Fiery clouds fell from the sky like snow
and he ordered the soldiers to stamp them down.'") That Dante was
acquainted with this book of the ^De meteoris~ (see I, iv, 9) of
Albertus Magnus is borne out by the fact that it was his
authority for the quotations from Albumazar and Seneca in the
^Convivio~ (II, xiii, 22).

	|32.  stuolo~: "Army," "host"; see ^Inf.~ VIII, 69.

	|33.  fiamme cadere infino a terra salde~: See the
description in the ^Epistola Alexandri~ quoted in n. to vss. 31-
36.

	|34.  scalpitar~: "Stamp out," strongly suggesting the
friction of feet on burning ground and flakes of fire.

	|35.  acci@o che~ = ^per ci@o che~, "inasmuch
as."

	|vapore~: Fire was termed ^vapor igneus~ ("igneous
vapor") in the science of the day.

	|36.  mei~ = ^meglio~ (see ^Inf.~ II, 36).

	|stingueva~ = ^estingueva.~

	|mentre ch'era solo~:  See the description in the ^Epistola
Alexandri~ quoted in n. to vss. 31-36.

	|38-39.  com' esca sotto focile~: Again the deliberate
stress on the friction of bare feet on burning sand.

	|39.  a doppiar lo dolore~: The scorching of the feet by
the burning sand is added to the burning by the fire that falls
from above.

	|40.  la tresca~: Buti comments: "Tresca si chiama uno
ballo saltereccio, ove sia grande e veloce movimento e di molti
inviluppato."  ("^Tresca~ is a dance full of jumps, very fast
moving, engaged in by many participants.")

	|42.  escotendo da s@e~: The subject of this participial
construction is the souls, not the hands.

	|l'arsura fresca~:  The fire, freshly fallen on the naked
sinners.

	|44-45.  fuor che ' demon duri...uscinci~: The defense
made by the devils at the walls of the city of Dis is described
in ^Inf.~ VIII, 82-130.

	|44.  che'~ = ^che i.~

	|45.  uscinci~ = ^ci uscinno (uscirono)~; see E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 256.

	|46.  quel grande~: Capaneus, depicted as a towering
giant by Statius (^Theb.~ X, 872 and ^passim~), was one of the
seven legendary kings who besieged Thebes (see n. to vss. 6869).
As he was scaling the walls of the city, Capaneus defied Jupiter,
and the god struck him dead with a thunderbolt.  Dante has
apparently borrowed several touches from Statius' account of
Capaneus (^Theb.~ X, 883-84, 897-911, 918-19, 927-30, 935-39):

     Iamque Iovem circa studiis diversa fremebant
     Argolici Tyriique dei....
     non tamen haec turbant pacem Iovis: ecce quierunt
     iurgia, cum mediis Capaneus auditus in astris.
     "nullane pro trepidis" clamabat, "numina Thebis
     statis?  ubi infandae segnes telluris alumni,
     Bacchus et Alcides?  pudet instigare minores.
     tu potius venias-quis enim concurrere nobis
     dignior?  en cineres Semeleaque busta tenentur -- ,
     nunc age, nunc totis in me conitere flammis,
     Iuppiter!  an pavidas tonitru turbare puellas
     fortior et soceri turres exscindere Cadmi?"

     Ingemuit dictis superum dolor; ipse furentem
     risit et incussa sanctarum mole comarum,
     "quaenam spes hominum tumidae post proelia Phlegrae!
     tune etiam feriendus?"  ait. premit undique lentum
     turba deum frendens et tela ultricia poscit,
     ............................
     ...in media vertigine mundi
     stare virum insanasque vident deposcere pugnas,
     ............................
     talia dicentum toto Iove filmen adactum
     corripuit: primae fugere in nubila cristae,
     et clipei niger umbo cadit, iamque omnia lucent
     membra viri....
     stat tamen, extremumque in sidera versus anhelat,
     pectoraque invisis obicit fumantia muris,
     ne caderet: sed membra virum terrena relinquunt,
     exuiturque animus; paulum si tardius artus
     cessissent, potuit fulmen sperare secundum.

     Meanwhile about Jove's throne the Argive and the Tyrian
     deities were clamouring in diverse factions....  Yet
     undisturbed is the peace of Jove; and lo! their quarrels
     ceased when in mid-heaven Capaneus was heard: "Are there no
     gods among you," he cries, "who stand for panic-stricken
     Thebes?  Where are the sluggard sons of this accursed land,
     Bacchus and Alcides?  Any of lesser name I am ashamed to
     challenge.  Rather come thou -- what worthier antagonist? For
     lo!  Semele's ashes and her tomb are in my power! -- come thou,
     and strive with all thy flames against me, thou, Jupiter!  Or
     art thou braver at frightening timid maidens with thy
     thunder, and razing the towers of thy father-in-law Cadmus?"

     Loud rose the gods' indignant clamour at his words; Jove
     himself laughed at the madman, and shaking the thick mass of
     his sacred locks: "What hope has man after Phlegra's
     arrogant assault?" he says, "and must thou too be struck
     down?"  As he hesitates the gods throng round him, gnashing
     their teeth and crying for the avenging weapons....They see
     the hero stand midway in the dizzy height of air, and summon
     them to insane battle....Even as he spoke, the thunderbolt
     struck him, hurled with the whole might of Jove: his crest
     first vanished into the clouds, the blackened shield-boss
     dropped, and all the hero's limbs are now illumined....He
     stands nevertheless, and turning towards heaven pants out
     his life and leans his smoking breast on the hated
     battlements, lest he should fall; but his earthly frame
     deserts the hero, and his spirit is released; yet had his
     limbs been consumed a whit more slowly, he might have
     expected a second thunderbolt.

	|47.  lo 'ncendio~ = ^lo incendio.~

	|torto~: This could mean "twisted" and refer to the giant's
body as he writhes under the fire; but since Capaneus appears to scorn
the fire, the adjective probably refers to the "scowling" expression on
his face -- an echo of the Latin ^torvus~ that Statius applies to the
great figure as it lies dead (^Theb.~ XI, 9-11):

     ille iacet lacerae complexus fragmina turris,
     torvus adhuc visu memorandaque facta relinquens
     gentibus...

     Grasping the fragment of a shattered tower the hero lies,
     with a scowl yet upon his face, and leaving deeds for all
     the world to tell of....

	|48.  maturi~: Some MSS have "marturi" (a form of
^marturare~, akin to ^martoriare~, "to torture"), and Petrocchi
has accepted this form rather than the "maturi" of earlier
editions.  But "maturi" is surely to be preferred here (since the
MS tradition allows it without question) for a ^conceptual~
reason: pride (as will be made clear by subsequent uses of this
metaphor) is considered to be "green," "unripe," "sour"
(^acerbo~). (See ^Inf.~ XXV, 18, where "acerbo" refers to the
proud Vanni Fucci, in connection with whom Capaneus is recalled.)
This rain of fire ought to "ripen" (humble) the proud Capaneus,
but seems not to do so.

	|49-51.  E quel medesmo...morto~: The supine Capaneus has
turned his head to observe the fact, then shouts at the
wayfarers, which is what prompts Virgil to shout back so loudly
(see vss. 61-62).

	|52-60.  Se Giove stanchi...allegra~: A blasphemer even
now, Capaneus reviles the God he knew as the supreme deity.  For
Statius' description of his defiance of Jupiter see ^Theb.~ X,
902-6, quoted in n. to vs. 46.

	|53.  aguta~ = ^acuta.~

	|55.  li altri~: The Cyclopes, Vulcan's
assistants.

	|a muta a muta~: "In relays."

	|56.  Mongibello~: Another name for Mount Etna, in
Sicily.  In the interior of Mount Etna and on one of the Lipari
Islands, according to myth, Vulcan had his workshops and with the
help of the Cyclopes ("li altri" of vs. 55) forged Jupiter's
thunderbolts.  See ^Aen.~ VIII, 416-22:

     Insula Sicanium iuxta latus Aeoliamque
     erigitur Liparen, fumantibus ardua saxis,
     quam subter specus et Cyclopum exesa caminis
     antra Aetnaea tonant, validique incudibus ictus
     auditi referunt gemitus, striduntque cavernis
     stricturae Chalybum et fornacibus ignis anhelat,
     Volcani domus et Volcania nomine tellus.

     Hard by the Sicanian coast and Aeolian Lipare rises an
     island, steep with smoking rocks.  Beneath it thunders a
     cave, and the vaults of Aetna, scooped out by Cyclopean
     forges; strong strokes are heard echoing groans from the
     anvils, masses of Chalyb steel hiss in the caverns, and the
     fire pants in the furnace -- the home of Vulcan and the land
     Vulcan's by name.

	|58.  la pugna di Flegra~: In the battle of Phlegra
Jupiter, with the help of Hercules, defeated the giants who
attempted to storm Olympus.  In the various versions of the
story, Phlegra (literally, "the place of burning") was always
localized in volcanic regions.  At first it was located on the
Macedonian peninsula of Pallene; later it sometimes was placed on
the Phlegraean Fields (Campi Flegrei), a volcanic region west of
Naples and east of Cumae.  The phrase "pugna di Flegra" seems to
be an echo of "proelia Phlegrae" ("Phlegra's assault") in the
verses of the ^Thebaid~ (X, 907-9) that relate how as Jupiter
makes ready to hurl his bolt at the defiant Capaneus he thinks of
that other, greater battle with the giants (see n. to vs. 46).

	|59.  con tutta sua forza~: See Capaneus' defiant
challenge to Jupiter (^Theb.~ X, 904), quoted in n. to vs. 46.

	|63.  non s'ammorza~: The verb keeps the image of the
flame (^ammorzarsi~ being said of a flame that "dies down"),
thereby suggesting an inner flame of pride burning in Capaneus,
even in this second death of Hell; it is matched by the terrible
rain of fire without, which "does not seem to ripen him."

	|65.  nullo~ = ^nessun.~

	|66.  compito~ (pronounced ^comp@ito~) = ^compiuto~; past
participle of ^compire.~

	|67.  labbia~: "Aspect," "countenance"; see ^Inf.~ VII, 7.

	|68.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|regi~ = ^re.~

	|69.  assiser~ = ^assediarono~ (from ^assidere, assedere~).

	|Tebe~: Thebes, city of Boeotia.  As a result of the dispute
between Eteocles and Polynices, sons of Oedipus, over the
sovereignty of Thebes, an expedition against the city on behalf
of Polynices, known as the war of the Seven against Thebes, was
undertaken by Adrastus, king of Argos, accompanied by his son-
in-law Capaneus, Amphiaraus, Hippomedon, Parthenopaeus,
Polynices, and Tydeus.  The battle is the subject of the
^Thebaid~ of Statius.

	|70.  Dio~: Capaneus' blasphemy, which was aimed at the
pagan Jupiter, is accounted a blasphemy against the true God.

	|71.  lui~: Dative here.

	|72.  fregi~: "Decorations," "ornaments."

	|73.  mi vien~ (imperative) = ^vienmi.~

	|metti~ = ^metta.~

	|74.  ancor~: Modifies "guarda" (vs 73); the words imply.
"See that you do as you have done up to now, and do not..." (see
vs. 12).

	|76.  divenimmo~ (Latin ^devenio~) = ^giungemmo.~

	|spiccia~: The verb is commonly used of blood spurting from a
vein and therefore is not only appropriate and suggestive here but
accounts for the wayfarer's shudder (vs. 78).  See ^Purg.~ IX, 102:
"come sangue che fuor di vena spiccia," where the word is again used in
rhyme with "arsiccia."

	|79-81.  Quale del Bulicame...quello~: See "bulicame" as
a common noun in ^Inf.~ XII, 117.  Here, by antonomasia, it
refers to a famous hot sulphurous spring near Viterbo, noted
since Roman times.  Like similar establishments, the hot spring
known as the Bulicame was the resort of prostitutes (the
"peccatrici" of vs. 80), who supplied the baths in their houses
with water by means of conduits leading from the spring.
Benvenuto says:

     Ad cuius declarationem debes scire quod apud civitatem
     Viterbii est quaedam mirabilis aqua calida, rubea,
     sulphurea, profunda, de cuius lecto exit quidam rivulus
     parvus, quem meretrices habitantes in illa planicie dividunt
     inter se; nam in qualibet domuncula meretricis est balneum
     ex illo rivulo ordinatum; ergo bene est comparatio propria
     in rubore, in calore et in foetore.

     To understand this passage, you must know that in the
     environs of Viterbo there is an extraordinary hot spring,
     which is reddish, sulphurous, and deep.  From its bed rushes
     a brook, which the prostitutes of that area divide among
     them.  Indeed, even in the most modest prostitute's
     dwelling, there is a bath that uses the water from that
     brook.  It is therefore a good comparison, apt as to the
     reddish color, the heat, and the bad smell.

For a convincing rebuttal of the thesis maintained by G. Mazzoni
(1941, pp. 239-66), among others, that the reading should be
^pectatrici~ or some variant thereof, meaning "hemp combers"
(^pettinatrici di canapa~), and also for examples of ^peccatrice~
in the sense of "prostitute," see M. Barbi and A. Duro (1949).
Also see Petrocchi's long note.

	|82.  le pendici~: The sloping inner banks of the
conduit.

	|83.  fatt' era 'n pietra~: For a justification of this
reading, as preferable to ^fatt' eran pietra~, see Petrocchi's
note.  The past participle "fatto" agrees with the first subject,
"lo fondo suo," according to common usage in such cases; see
^Inf.~ II, 23.

	|e ' margini~ = ^e i margini~, the tops or edges of
the banks, as distinguished from the "pendici," or sloping sides.

	|84.  per ch'io m'accorsi~: The wayfarer makes this
surmise from the observed fact that the "margini" are of stone
and have no burning sand on their surface and moreover, as we are
told in vs. 141, no fire falls on them: "li margini fan via, che
non son arsi."

	|lici~ = ^l@i.~  The form was common in prose in
Dante's time.

	|85.  dimostrato~ = ^mostrato.~

	|87.  sogliare~ = ^soglia~, the threshold of the main
entrance to Hell, which is now left forever unbarred (see ^Inf.~
VIII, 125-26).  See ^Aen.~ VI, 126-27: "Facilis descensus Averno:
/ noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis." ("Easy is the
descent to Avernus: night and day the door of gloomy Dis stands
open.")

	|90.  ammorta~: "Deadens," "quenches," as is clear from
the words "si spegne" in vs. 142.  Dante uses the verb in rhyme
in his ^canzone~ "Io son venuto" (^Rime~ C, 35): "'l freddo lor
spirito ammorta." ("The chill has deadened their spirit.")

	|91.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|94-95.  In mezzo mar...Creta~: The opening phrase echoes
Virgil's "medio ponto," and the two lines, his description of
Crete (^Aen.~ III, 104-6):

     Creta Iovis magni medio iacet insula ponto,
     mons Idaeus ubi et gentis cunabula nostrae.
     centum urbes habitant magnas, uberrima regna...

     In midocean lies Crete, the island of great Jove, where is
     Mount Ida, and the cradle of our race.  There men dwell in a
     hundred great cities, a realm most fertile....

The sea is the Mediterranean, which, as its name implies, lies at
the center of an inhabited hemisphere of land; thus Crete is
truly at the center of the center.  Benvenuto comments:

     Est...hic bene notandum, quod autor per istam insulam
     figurat nobis mundum istum, sive terram habitabilem, quia
     ista insula est circumcincta mari sicut terra tota
     oceano...et est quasi in medio mundi, et quasi omnia maria
     et confinia partium terrae terminantur ibi; et ibi regna
     primo incoeperunt secundum poetas.

     It...must be carefully noted here that by means of this
     island, the author is representing the world -- that is to
     say, the inhabited earth.  For this island is surrounded by
     the sea, just as the entire earth is surrounded by
     ocean...and it is almost at the center of the world.  Nearly
     all the seas, and the outer boundaries of the various parts
     of the earth, end there.  And it was there, according to the
     poets, that kingdoms first came into being.

The Trojan race, and therefore (according to Virgil) the Roman
race, had its beginning there, as Anchises says in the
continuation of the passage from the ^Aeneid~ quoted above
(^Aen.~ III, 107-9):

     maximus unde pater, si rite audita recordor,
     Teucrus Rhoeteas primum est advectus ad oras
     optavitque locum regno....

     ...whence our earliest ancestor Teucer, if I recall the tale
     aright, first sailed to the Rhoetean shores, and chose a
     site for his kingdom.

Thus, in accordance with Anchises' interpretation of the oracle's
injunction in ^Aen.~ III, 96: "antiquam exquirite matrem" ("seek
out your ancient mother"), Aeneas and his Trojan band first made
their way to Crete.

	|94.  In mezzo mar~ = ^in mezzo al mar.~

	|siede~: See ^Inf.~ V, 97.

	|un paese guasto~: "A wasteland."  An episode in
the ^Aeneid~, which occurred at a time when Aeneas and his band
had not been long in their new island home, may have entered into
Dante's conception of Crete as a ruined, wasted land (see ^Aen.~
III, 137-39):

     ...subito cum tabida membris,
     corrupto caeli tractu, miserandaque venit
     arboribusque satisque lues et letifer annus.

     On a sudden, from a tainted quarter of the sky, came
     a pestilence and season of death, to the wasting of our
     bodies and the piteous ruin of trees and crops.

	|96.  sotto 'l cui rege~: For the form "rege," see ^Inf.~
VIII, 49.  The reference is to Saturn, mythical king of Crete,
identified by the Romans with the Greek god Cronus and hence
regarded by them as the father (by Rhea) of Jupiter, Neptune,
Pluto, Juno, Ceres, and Vesta.

	|fu gi@a 'l mondo casto~: In ^Par.~ XXI, 26-27, Saturn again is
alluded to as the "caro duce / sotto cui giacque ogne malizia morta";
the reference, as here, is to the Golden Age that prevailed during his
reign, the first of a succession of ages, according to the famous
account of Ovid at the beginning of the ^Metamorphoses~ (I, 89-93):

     Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae vindice nullo, sponte sua,
     sine lege fidem rectumque colebat. poena metusque aberant,
     nec verba minantia fixo aere legebantur, nec supplex turba
     timebat iudicis ora sui, sed erant sine iudice tuti.

     Golden was that first age, which, with no one to compel,
     without a law, of its own will, kept faith and did the
     right.  There was no fear of punishment, no threatening
     words were to be read on brazen tablets; no suppliant throng
     gazed fearfully upon its judge's face, but without judges
     lived secure.

Although this first Golden Age was truly an age without injustice
(^malizia~), Ovid goes on to say (^Metam.~ I, 113-15) that,
later:

     Postquam Saturno tenebrosa in Tartara misso
     sub Iove mundus erat, subiit argentea proles,
     auro deterior, fulvo pretiosior aere.

     After Saturn had been banished to the dark land of death,
     and the world was under the sway of Jove, the silver race
     came in, lower in the scale than gold, but of greater worth
     than yellow brass.

Ovid then tells of the continuing decline of human civilization
through successive ages that find their exact correspondence in
the metals that make up the "gran veglio" described here in Canto
XIV, vss. 103-14.

	According to Virgil (^Aen.~ VIII, 319-25), when Saturn
was banished by his son Jupiter from Crete, he came to Italy and
there established another Golden Age.  Virgil prophesied the
return of that age (^Eclog.~ IV, 6): "Iam...  redeunt Saturnia
regna." ("Now the reign of Saturn returns.")

	|98.  Ida~: See n. to vss. 100-102.

	|99.  vieta~: This word may derive either from the Latin
^vetus~, "old," or from the Latin ^vietus~, "shrunken,"
"withered," "decayed."  The latter meaning fits the context very
well.

	|100-102.  Rea la scelse...grida~: Rhea, also called
Cybele, is the ancient goddess represented as the daughter of
Heaven (Uranus) and Earth (Gaea) and the wife of Saturn.  She was
the mother of Vesta, Ceres, Juno, Pluto, Neptune, and Jupiter.
According to legend, Saturn, in order to avert the fulfillment of
the prophecy that he would be dethroned by one of his children,
devoured each one as soon as it was born, with the exception of
Jupiter, who was saved by an artifice of his mother.  When Rhea
was on the point of giving birth to Jupiter, she retired to Mount
Ida in Crete.  When the infant was born, she gave Saturn a stone
wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed, supposing it to
be his child.  To prevent Saturn from hearing the cries of the
infant, Rhea ordered her priests, the Curetes, to shout and clash
their swords and shields.  She thus succeeded in raising the
child Jupiter without the knowledge of his father.  Eventually
Saturn was forced to disgorge the children he had swallowed and,
in fulfillment of the prophecy, was dethroned by Jupiter.  The
story is elaborated by Ovid (^Fasti~ IV, 197-214), Dante's
probable source.  See also Virgil, ^Georg.~ IV, 150-52.

	|103.  Dentro dal monte sta dritto un gran veglio~: In
the context of an observed decline in the following sense, that
"cuncto mortalium generi minorem in dies fieri propemodum" ("with
the entire human race the stature on the whole is becoming
smaller daily"), Pliny (^Nat. hist.~ VII, xvi, 73) reports: "In
Creta terrae motu rupto monte inventum est corpus stans XLVI
cubitorum, quod alii Orionis alii Oti esse arbitrabantur."  ("When
a mountain in Crete was cleft by an earthquake a body 69 feet in
height was found, which some people thought must be that of Orion
and others of Otus.")

	|103-111.  Dentro dal monte...l'altro, eretto~: The
"veglio," as described in these verses, clearly represents a
fusion of Ovid's ages (see n. to vs. 96) with the great image in
the dream of Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:31-35):

     Tu, rex, videbas, et ecce quasi statua una grandis: statua
     illa magna et statura sublimis stabat contra te, et intuitus
     eius erat terribilis.  Huius statuae caput ex auro optimo
     erat, pectus autem et brachia de argento, porro venter et
     femora ex aere, tibiae autem ferreae, pedum quaedam pars
     erat ferrea, quaedam autem fictilis.  Videbas ita, donec
     abscissus est lapis de monte sine manibus, et percussit
     statuam in pedibus eius ferreis et fictibilibus, et
     comminuit eos; tunc contrita sunt pariter ferrum, testa,
     aes, argentum et aurum, et redacta quasi in favillam
     aestivae areae quae rapta sunt vento, nullusque locus
     inventus est eis; lapis autem qui percusserat statuam factus
     est mons magnus, et implevit universam terram.

     Thou, O king, sawest, and behold ^there was~ as it were a
     great statue.  This statue, which was great and high, tall
     of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was
     terrible.

     The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and
     the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass:

     And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of
     clay.

     Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain
     without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet
     thereof that were of iron and of clay and broke them in
     pieces.

     Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver and the
     gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
     a summer's thrashingfloor.  And they were carried away by
     the wind: and there was no place found for them.  But the
     stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and
     filled the whole earth.

	|104.  Dammiata~: The old town of Damietta in Egypt,
situated at the mouth of the easternmost of the two principal
branches formed by the Nile at its delta.  During the Middle Ages
Damietta seems to have been identified with the ancient Memphis.
The modern Damietta, situated four miles farther inland, is built
on the remains of the old town.  I. Del Lungo (1906, pp. 107-8)
says:

     Damiata per l'Oriente ha ragione d'esser qui nominata,
     perch@e, citt@a marittima, prospetta direttamente Creta, e
     di qua da Creta la penisola italica e, in essa, Roma;
     occorrendo alla poetica figurazione del Veglio avere in
     diritta linea i due termini correlativi, l'uno che @e alle
     spalle l'altro in faccia di lui....Damiata, dunque, ha nel
     concepimento dantesco funzione meramente geografica.

     Damietta is quite properly mentioned here for the East.
     Being situated on the coast, it looks directly at Crete,
     and, this side of Crete, to the Italian peninsula and to
     Rome.  It is necessary for the poetic image of the Old Man
     to have the two correlative terms in a direct line, one in
     back and one in front of him....Damietta, then, has a merely
     geographic function in the Dantesque conception.

	|105.  speglio~ = ^specchio.~

	|109.  eletto~: "Chosen," "choice"; past participle of
^eligere.~

	|114.  accolte~: "Collected" as the tears fall at the
foot of the cracked figure.

	|grotta~: The rock of Mount Ida; see this word again in ^Purg.~
I, 48; III, 90; XIII, 45.

	|115-119.  Lor corso...Cocito~: Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon,
and Cocytus all belong to the classical conception of the
underworld (on Phlegethon, for example, see ^Aen.~ VI, 548-51,
quoted in the n. to vs. 134; also Statius, ^Theb.~ IV, 520-24).
The wayfarers have already encountered the first three: Acheron
at the entrance to the first circle (^Inf.~ III, 71), Styx
outside the city of Dis (^Inf.~ VII, 106), and Phlegethon in the
first ^girone~ of this seventh circle (^Inf.~ XII, 53).  However,
Phlegethon was not named; and the wayfarer does not realize that
he has seen it, and will question his guide further.  Cocytus
lies ahead.

	|115.  valle~: Hell is so called twice again: see ^Purg.~
XXIV, 84 and ^Par.~ XVII, 137.

	|si diroccia~: "Flows down from rock to rock."

	|117.  doccia~: The "conduit" running out across the
sand, termed a "fiumicello" in vs. 77.

	|118.  dove pi@u non si dismonta~: The center of the
earth.

	|119.  fanno Cocito~: The subject of "fanno" is the
"tears" that flow down from the crack in the "veglio."  The pond
of Cocytus is the last of the four so-called infernal rivers (see
n. to vss. 121-38).

	|e qual sia quello stagno~: See ^Aen.~ VI, 323: "Cocyti stagna
alta vides."  ("Thou seest the deep pools of Cocytus.")

	|121-138.  Se 'l presente rigagno...rimossa~: Virgil's
account of what has been called the "hydraulic system" of Hell
has frequently puzzled the commentators.  His initial description
of the four "rivers" of Hell and their derivation from "our
world" is straightforward enough, but his answer to the
wayfarer's question of vss. 121-23 is more ambiguous.  In Dante's
conception Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and Cocytus are none of
them really rivers, for water does not flow in them.  They are
all circular bodies of water and may all, not just Cocytus, be
more properly called "stagni"; that is, they all contain still or
stagnant water.  Styx is, in fact, a "palude," or swamp,
surrounding the city of Dis.  Phlegethon (although the wayfarer
has not yet grasped the fact) is the stream of boiling blood
"that embraces the entire plain" (^Inf.~ XII, 53) and forms the
first ^girone~ of this seventh circle; when not viewed as a
whole, but only at one given point, it has the narrower shape of
a river and is so termed at times.  The same is true, given the
conical shape of Hell, of Acheron. Cocytus has been explicitly
called a "stagno" (vs. 119).

	If all the waters of Hell form one system deriving from
the crack in the "veglio" and are made up of the tears that,
collected, bore their way through the rock and flow down into the
cavity of Hell, and if the above-named "rivers" are actually
"stagni" and as such do not flow down, then it follows that there
must be connecting streams or canals between them through which
the water passes from one to another.  The wayfarers encountered
one stream, termed a "ruscello," near the boundary between the
fourth and fifth circles; it issued from underground and clearly
fed the swamp of Styx (see ^Inf.~ VII, 100-108).  Looking back to
this "ruscello" flowing into Styx, we see that it must in fact be
a section of the stream that leads from Acheron to Styx, though
whether it flows underground all the way from Acheron to the
point where it comes bubbling to the surface (^Inf.~ VII, 101) we
are not told.  However, Virgil's next remark bears the clear
implication that the two wayfarers might have encountered such a
connecting stream above ground at some other point through that
upper area if, in turning ever leftward, they had proceeded far
enough around any given circle.  Thus the wayfarers' present
conversation about the waters of Hell presupposes an awareness on
both their parts that they have already encountered a connecting
stream, namely the "ruscello" leading into Styx.

	The wayfarer's first question concerns the stream now
before them that "spurts out from the forest" (vss. 76-77), at
the very edge of which they are standing, and runs out across the
plain of sand.  Dante now refers to the stream as a "rigagno" (it
has already, in vs. 77, been termed a "fiumicello" and might be
called a "ruscello").  Virgil has explained that the four named
bodies of water, the traditional "rivers" of Hell, derive from a
single source in "our world": Crete.  This "rigagno," as the
wayfarer now understands from Virgil's explanation, must have its
source too in the tears that flow down from the crack in the
"veglio" and that make up all the waters of Hell.  But if this
water, flowing so red in the channel before him, derives from
"our world," why, he asks, does it appear "at this edge only"?

	Not having forgotten the "ruscello" which he saw leading
into Styx, the wayfarer is now wondering about the connecting
canals.  Virgil has told him that the stream before them flows on
down to form Cocytus.  Thus the wayfarer's first question,
"Perch$e ci appar pur a questo vivagno?" (vs. 123), concerns this
stream considered as a connecting stream between Styx and
Cocytus.  (Since, as his second question reveals, he does not yet
understand where Phlegethon is, that "river" is no part of the
matter at the moment.) Now, the two wayfarers have traversed the
sixth circle and two thirds of the seventh, and nowhere so far
have they come across any canal -- and there must be one -- that
joins Styx and Cocytus.  Does it flow across the sixth circle?
Does it flow through the wood (the second ^girone~ of the seventh
circle), on the far edge of which they now stand? Why only at
this point do they meet such a connecting canal?

	To answer the wayfarer's question, Virgil looks back over
the whole area of Hell that they have so far traversed.  He is
not forgetting the stream that feeds Styx, but he makes a
generalization about Hell and the manner of their descent through
it.  They have turned always to the left (with the notable
exception in the sixth circle -- see ^Inf.~ IX, 132-- which he
chooses to overlook!), yet nowhere have they come full circle
around any of the levels, so that the connecting canal in
question might well have traversed one or more of the circles and
been visible in any one of them (even between Acheron and Styx)
without their having come upon it.  Therefore, if "something new
appears" to them (vs. 128) in their descent through Hell, it
should not cause the wayfarer to wonder.  Virgil's "cosa nova"
(vs.  128) has been a major source of difficulty here; for some
commentators have taken the words to mean that he and his charge
have forgotten about the connecting stream they encountered
between Acheron and Styx, at the "edge" of the fourth circle.
But surely Virgil is not to be thought of as having such a bad
memory; neither does he impute any such forgetfulness to his
charge (and Dante can hardly have forgotten!).  The "cosa nova"
is precisely the "presente rigagno" (vs. 121) that here flows out
across the sand, viewed as one of the sections of the canal that
must connect the "stagni" named; and it is new because, since
encountering the "ruscello" that bubbles up and flows into Styx,
they have seen no such canal again until now.  If they had
circled far enough, on either circle six or circle seven (i.e.,
through the wood), they might have come across it before now,
Virgil's answer clearly implies.  It runs above ground through
the wood.

	Dante has understood this, but he has ^not~ understood
one very important matter.  As far as he is concerned, all the
rivers of the underworld, as Virgil and the classical poets had
conceived them, have been accounted for in the topography of Hell
except two: Phlegethon, named by Virgil as one of the four, and
Lethe, traditionally a river of this netherworld.  Virgil is
silent about the one (Lethe) and says that the other (Phlegethon)
is "formed of this rain" of tears (vs. 132) that, in the
"rigagno" before their eyes, flows down to form Cocytus.  Where,
then, are these two?  Lethe is quickly disposed of.  That river
(and it is a true river, a stream that flows) the wayfarer will
see in Purgatory.  As for Phlegethon, the boiling of the red
stream before them should answer that question, Virgil says.  For
what else does the name Phlegethon itself imply? (See n. to vs.
134.) In short, Virgil says, "Have you not understood that the
river of boiling blood that forms the first ^girone~ of the
seventh circle is Phlegethon?" Virgil's reference to Phlegethon
is to the river itself, not this stream.  But the two things put
together provide a final explanation: this "fiumicello" or
"rigagno" that flows out across the sand before their eyes is the
connecting canal that leads from Phlegethon to Cocytus.  The
words "esta piova" (vs. 132) refer to the churning red water that
the wayfarer sees running through the canal before them; the
tears from the "veglio" have turned red in the overflow from
Phlegethon. And this the wayfarer had not understood, because he
did not know where Phlegethon was, not having grasped the fact
that the river of blood which is the first ^girone~ of this
seventh circle ^was~ that river.

	All is clear now.  Between Acheron and Styx they had
encountered a connecting canal.  Would there not be one leading
off from Styx to the other "stagni" named? Yes, but the wayfarers
did not turn about the sixth circle (where curiously enough they
went to the right!) far enough to encounter it, wherever it may
run through the cemetery of the heretics.  Here now is just such
a canal as might have been expected, flowing across the inner
^girone~ of the seventh circle after spurting forth from the edge
of the wood; and yet it is not the canal that leads from Styx,
but that which leads from Phlegethon, since as Dante now
understands, the river of blood of the first ^girone~ of this
seventh circle is precisely Phlegethon.  For other interpretations
of this famous crux, see M. Barbi (1937), pp. 132-43, A. Camilli
(1943), and the commentaries.

	|123.  vivagno~: "Border," the innermost boundary of the
second ^girone~, the edge of the wood where the wayfarers stand.

	|129.  de'~ = ^deve.~

	|131.  Flegetonta~ = ^Flegetonte.~  See the similar form
"orizzonta" in ^Inf.~ XI, 113.

	|Let@e~: See Min@os (^Inf.~ V, 4, 17; XIII, 96), Semiramis
(^Inf.~  V, 58) Cleopatr@as (^Inf~ V 63), Par@is (^Inf.~ V, 67),
Flegi@as (^Inf.~ VIII, 19, 24), already encountered, and Climen@e
(^Par.~ XVII, 1).  On the rule for the accentuation of such names, see
n. to ^Inf.~ V, 4; also E. G. Parodi (1957), pp. 233-34.

	|132.  di'~ = ^dici.~

	|piova~ = ^pioggia~, the tears that fall from the crack in the
"gran veglio."

	|134.  ma 'l bollor de l'acqua rossa~: The pointed
reference here to the meaning of the Greek name Phlegethon
(%phi%lambda%epsilon%gamma%$epsilon%theta%omega%nu\)
-- "flaming," "fiery" -- does not necessarily imply a
knowledge of Greek on Dante's part (see n. to ^Inf.~ IV, 88).
This much Dante might have gathered from Virgil (^Aen.~ VI, 548-
51):

     Respicit Aeneas subito et sub rupe sinistra
     moenia lata videt, triplici circumdata muro,
     quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis,
     Tartareus Phlegethon, torquetque sonantia saxa.

     Suddenly Aeneas looks back, and under a cliff on the left
     sees a broad castle, girt with triple wall and encircled
     with a rushing flood of torrent flames -- Tartarean
     Phlegethon, that rolls along thundering rocks.

The following etymology is given in the ^Magnae derivationes~
of Uguccione da Pisa, with which Dante was acquainted (see P.
Toynbee, 1902, p. 104): ^"Flegeton-ontis~, quidam fluvius
infernalis totus ardens, a ^fos~ quod est ignis, vel ^flegi~ quod
est inflammans, et totus."  (^"Flegeton-ontis~, a river of the
underworld composed entirely of flame: from ^fos~, which is
fire -- or ^flegi~, because it is afire -- and ^totus~ [all].")  Also
see Statius, ^Theb.~ IV, 523: "Fumidus atra vadis Phlegethon
incendia volvit."  ("Smoky Phlegethon rolls down his streams of
murky flame.")

clearer.
