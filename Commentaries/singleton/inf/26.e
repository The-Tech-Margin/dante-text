	|1-3.  Godi, Fiorenza...spande~: The bitter irony of the
opening verses, sealed so powerfully by the third, is evident
enough.  A. Chiappelli (1930) points out the possible echo in vs. 2
of an inscription on the west front of the Palazzo del Podest@a
in Florence that exalts the city with the words: "que mare, que
terram, que totum possidet orbem" ("who rules the sea, the land,
and, in fact, the whole world").

	|4-5.  Tra li ladron...vergogna~: The five Florentine
thieves whom the wayfarer has just encountered in the seventh
^bolgia~ are all of noble or upper-class families.  The stress
falls on "cotali" and again on "onde" ("wherefore").

	|6.  orranza~ = ^onoranza.~  See ^Inf.~ IV, 74.  The irony
continues.

	|7.  Ma se presso al mattin del ver si sogna~: For the
ancient belief that dreams that come just before dawn are
prophetic, see Horace, ^Satires~ I, x, 33; "post mediam
noctem...cum somnia vera" ("after midnight, when dreams are
true").  See also Ovid, ^Heroides~ XIX, 195-96: "namque sub
aurora, iam dormitante lucerna, / somnia quo cerni tempore vera
solent" ("for, just before dawn, when my lamp was already dying
down, at the time when dreams are wont to be true").  Sapegno
refers to Iacopo Passavanti's mention of this belief; see
passavanti, ^Lo specchio~, p. 351: "Quegli sogni che si fanno
intorno all'alba del d@i, secondo che dicono, sono i pi@u veri
sogni che si facciano."  ("Those dreams we have at the dawn of day
are, they say, the truest dreams one can have.")  At just such an
hour on three successive days in Purgatory, the wayfarer has a
dream which proves to be true and prophetic.  See ^Purg.~ IX,
13-20; XIX, 1-7; XXVII, 94-99.

	|9.  di quel: Male~, "disaster," is the noun
understood.

	|Prato~: Prato is a town in Tuscany, about eleven miles
northwest of Florence, on the road to Pistoia.  The allusion here is
not altogether clear (having the obscurity proper to certain
prophecies), for the people of Prato seem in the main to have been on
friendly terms with the Florentines.  Some interpreters, however, take
this as a reference to the feeling of discontent and envy that a small
state would naturally harbor against a powerful and overbearing
neighbor.  Or the meaning may be, as Butler suggests, that even Prato,
generally her friend, is now wishing evil to Florence.

	Others see an allusion to Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato,
who, after the failure of his attempt to make peace between the
rival factions in Florence in the spring of 1304, departed in
anger, leaving the city under an interdict and excommunicating
the inhabitants.  To this malediction of the cardinal were
commonly attributed the terrible calamities that shortly after
befell the city of Florence, calamities to which Dante's
"prediction" (of events that had in fact already taken place)
doubtless refers.  Thus Villani (VIII, 69), in recording the
cardinal's departure from Florence, says:

     Il legato cardinale...subitamente si part@i di Firenze a d@i
     4 Giugno 1304, dicendo a' Fiorentini: ^Dappoich@e volete
     essere in guerra e in maladizione, e non volete udire n@e
     ubbidire il messo del vicario di Dio, n@e avere riposo n@e
     pace tra voi, rimanete colla maladizione di Dio e con
     quella di santa Chiesa~, scomunicando i cittadini, e
     lasciando interdetta la cittade, onde si tenne, che per
     quella maladizione, o giusta o ingiusta, non fosse sentenzia
     e gran pericolo della nostra cittade, per le avversit@a e
     pericoli che le avvennero poco appresso, come innanzi faremo
     menzione.

     The cardinal legate...immediately left Florence, on the
     fourth of June 1304, saying to the Florentines: "Since you
     want to be at war and under a curse, and will neither hear
     nor obey the messenger of the Vicar of God, or have peace
     and quiet among yourselves, you will be left with the curse
     of God and of the Holy Church."  He excommunicated the
     citizens and put the city under interdict.  Wherefore it was
     believed that this curse, justly or unjustly; became a
     judgment and a great danger to our city, because of the
     adversities and dangers that befell it soon afterward, as I
     shall mention hereafter.

Villani (VIII, 70-71) then goes on to relate how in that same
year the Ponte alla Carraia, which in those days was made of
wood, suddenly gave way under the excessive weight of a great
crowd of people who were watching a show on the river and a large
number of them were drowned.  According to Benvenuto they were
watching a depiction of Hell and the torments of the damned:

     Inter alios illi de burgo sancti Floriani fecerunt
     proclamari publice, quod quicumque vellet scire nova de alio
     mundo, deberet venire kalendis maii ad pontem Carrariae; et
     in Arno flumine ordinaverunt solaria super barcis et
     naviculis.  Et fecerunt quamdam simulatam repraesentationem
     inferni cum ignibus et aliis poenis et suppliciis; et
     homines transfiguratos, et daemonia horribilia et alios
     nudos sub specie animarum.  Et videbantur daemones iniicere
     animas inter ista varia et crudelia tormenta cum maximis
     clamoribus et horrendis stridoribus visu et auditu.
     Novitate cuius spectaculi totus populus concurrit ad
     videndum: Unde pons Carrariae, qui tunc erat de lignamine,
     onustus multitudine magna nimis, cecidit in Arnum cum his,
     qui erant desuper.  Ex quo multi mortui sunt et suffocati,
     et multi destructi de persona....Et hoc fuit augurium
     alterius maioris damni de proximo eventuri ipsi civitati.

     The people of the St.  Florian quarter had it publicly
     proclaimed that whoever wanted to have news of the other
     world should come to the Ponte alla Carraia at the beginning
     of May.  They set up floats on boats and barges in the river
     Arno, and arranged a sort of representation of Hell, with
     fire and other pains and torments.  There were men in
     disguises, horrible demons and naked people representing
     souls.  Among other cruel torments, one could see the demons
     attacking the souls with great clamor and horrible screams,
     terrible to hear and behold.  Because this kind of
     representation was new, everyone went to see it.  Because of
     that, the Ponte alla Carraia, which was then made of wood,
     was so overloaded by the great crowd that it crashed into
     the Arno with all the people on it.  Many were drowned and
     killed and many bodies were broken....This was an augury of
     even greater harm that would come to the city in the near
     future.

Moreover, not long after, a great fire broke out in the heart of
the city and burned down over seventeen hundred palaces, towers,
and houses, destroying an immense amount of treasure and
merchandise./ E. G. Parodi (1908b, p. 26), among others, takes
the reference to be to the driving out of the Neri from Prato,
April 6, 1309.

	|10.  saria~ = ^sarebbe.~

	|11.  Cos@i foss' ei~: "So were it."  The shift to a note
of sadness is evident in what follows.

	|13-14.  su per le scalee...pria~: The wayfarers now
climb back up what was termed a "muro" in ^Inf.~ XXIV, 73 -- i.e.,
the steep, rough side of the bridgehead -- to the top of the bank
that divides the seventh from the eighth ^bolgia.~

	|14.  i borni~: Petrocchi's reading "iborni," instead of
the usual reading ^i borni~, reflected in the present
translation, is explained in a long note of his with reference to
A. Pagliaro (1961, pp. 201-9) and others.  In this reading it
would have the meaning "pale."

	|15.  mee~ = ^me.~  See ^@ee~ and other examples discussed
by E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 243.

	|18.  lo pi@e sanza la man non si spedia~: Apparently the
reef becomes rougher and steeper as the poets climb toward the
crest of the arching bridge.

	|non si spedia~ = ^non si~ ^spediva~, "was unable to make its
way."

	|19-24.  Allor mi dolsi...nol m'invidi~: This fervent
little prayer generates a certain suspense for the reader, who as
yet has seen nothing.  The verbs in the present tense following
"ridoglio" ("drizzo," "affreno," "soglio") temporarily place the
emphasis on Dante the poet, who has returned from his journey and
is now recalling and relating what he saw in the eighth ^bolgia.~

	|21.  'ngegno~: The poet's genius.  On the use of
"ingegno" here, see n. to ^Inf.~ II, 7.  It may be recalled that
at the beginning of his journey the poet invoked his own "alto
ingegno" (^Inf.~ II, 7).  Later the father of Guido Cavalcanti
referred to the poet's making the journey through Hell "per
altezza d'ingegno" (^Inf.~ X, 58-60).  Moreover, at the summit of
Mount Purgatory, Beatrice says of Dante that he was highly
endowed both naturally and divinely (^Purg.~ XXX, 109-12).  And
much later, in the ^Paradiso~, when the wayfaring Dante reaches
the constellation of Gemini, under which he declares he was born,
he thanks those stars for giving him the "ingegno" he has (^Par.~
XXII, 112-14).

	|22.  corra~: The verb suggests a journey.

	|23.  stella bona~: Singular for plural, the reference in
this case being to Gemini (see n. to vs. 21).

	|miglior cosa~: The "grazie divine" of ^Purg.~ XXX, 112.

	|24.  'l ben~: Dante's own genius.

	|ch'~: The ^che~ is redundant in this construction, a
repetition of the relative pronoun common in early Italian prose as
well as in verse.

	|io stessi nol m'invidi~: "I may not deny it to myself" (hence
"deprive myself of it").  Cf. the Latin ^invidere sibi.~
|stessi~ = ^stesso.~

	|25.  Quante~: Modifies "lucciole" (vs. 29), the object
of "vede."  The subject is "villan."

	|26-27.  nel tempo...ascosa~: In summertime, or, more
precisely, during the summer solstice, when the sun ("colui che
'l mondo schiara") "hides his face least from us," i.e., when the
nights are shortest.

	|28.  come la mosca cede a la zanzara~: At dusk.

	|30.  dov' e' vendemmia e ara~: Plowing is usually done
in the spring, and grape harvest takes place in the fall.  It is
summertime now, and there is respite from such labors.

	|33.  l@a 've 'l fondo parea~: The summit of the arch of
the bridge.

	|'ve~ = ^ove.~

	|parea~ = ^appariva.~

	|34-42.  E qual colui...invola~: Although the simile
applies to all the flames in the ^bolgia~, it characteristically
singles one out now, thus preparing for the selection of one from
among the many.  See ^Inf.~ V, 40-49 and the note; also
especially ^Inf.~ XV, 16-21.

	|34.  qual~: Modifies "carro," vs. 35.

	|colui che si
vengi@o con li orsi~: The prophet Elisha.  See IV Reg. 2:23-24:

     Ascendit autem inde in Bethel; cumque ascenderet per viam,
     pueri parvi egressi sunt de civitate et illudebant ei,
     dicentes: Ascende, calve, ascende, calve.  Qui cum
     respexisset, vidit eos et maledixit eis in nomine Domini;
     egressique sunt duo ursi de saltu, et laceraverunt ex eis
     quadraginta duos pueros.

     And [Eliseus] went up from thence to Bethel.  And as he was
     going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and
     mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head.  Go up, thou bald
     head.

     And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name
     of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the
     forest, and tore of them two and forty boys.

	|34.  vengi@o.~  Past absolute of ^vengiare (= vendicare~).

	|35.  vide 'l carro d'Elia~: See IV Reg. 2:11-12:

     Cumque pergerent et incedentes sermocinarentur, ecce currus
     igneus et equi ignei diviserunt utrumque; et ascendit Elias
     per turbinem in caelum.

     Eliseus autem videbat et clamabat: Pater mi, pater mi,
     currus Israel et auriga eius.  Et non vidit eum amplius....

     And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold a
     fiery chariot, and fiery horses parted them both asunder:
     and Elias went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

     And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the
     chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof.  And he saw him
     no more.

The reference to an Old Testament episode serves to distance the
narrative and remove it from the familiar everyday scene
suggested by the simile of the peasant in vss. 25-33.

	|36.  erti~: Dante's description of the erect posture of
the horses, an original detail, makes the image more vivid.  (Cf.
the poet's probable source, the Biblical passage quoted in n. to
vs. 35.)

	|levorsi~ = ^si levarono.~

	|39.  s@i come nuvoletta~: Cf."per turbinem" in the
Biblical passage quoted in n. to vs. 35.  For a "nuvoletta" as a
conspicuous feature of an ascension, see ^Vita nuova~ XXIII, 25.

	|40.  tal~: The comparison is with the "carro d'Elia,"
vs. 35.

	|ciascuna~: The "fiamma" of vs. 38.

	|40-41.  per la gola del fosso~: See "gola," ^Inf.~ XXIV,
123.  Porena observes that this might even be an explanatory
genitive: "that throat which is the ravine."

	|41.  nessuna~: The "flame" of vs. 38.

	|'l furto~: "The theft," as is made clearer by the verb
"invola" in the following verse.  Such terms serve to point up the
^contrapasso~ of the punishment: the punishing flames are thus furtive,
fraudulent.  See "il foco furo," ^Inf.~ XXVII, 127.

	|42.  e ogne fiamma un peccatore invola~: The reader is
told that the false counselors punished in this eighth ^bolgia~
are enveloped in flames, before Virgil explains this to his
charge.  When he does (vss. 47-48), Dante then indicates that he
had already "judged it to be so" (vss. 50-51).

	|43.  surto~ = ^sorto~, past participle of ^surgere~ (see
vs. 53).  Dante is not only standing as erect as possible, in
order to see into the ^bolgia~, but he is also leaning forward,
as the following two verses make clear.

	|45.  urto~ = ^urtato.~  On this truncated form, see E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 260.

	|46.  atteso~: "Intent."  See ^Inf.~ XIII, 109.

	|47.  Dentro~: The word comes in an emphatic
position.

	|dai~ = ^ai.~  See "dentro da" in vss. 58 and 64.

	|48.  catun~ = ^ciascuno.

	|di quel ch'~ = ^di quello da cui.

	|inceso~ = ^acceso.~  See ^Inf.~ XXII, 18.

	|50.  m'era avviso~: Cf. the Latin ^mihi visum erat.~

	|52-54.  chi @e...miso?~ Here again is a simile which in
its first part presents a human figure within a fire and by its
classical aura distances the narrative, as did the Old Testament
comparison in vss. 35-36 (see n. to vs. 35, above).

	|54.  miso~ = ^messo.~

	|54.  Ete@ocle~: Eteocles was the son of Oedipus, king of
Thebes, and Jocasta, and twin brother of Polynices.  When the
brothers compelled Oedipus to abdicate and leave Thebes, Oedipus
prayed to the gods that the twins might be eternally at enmity
with each other.  Eteocles and Polynices agreed to reign in
Thebes alternately year by year; but when Eteocles' term had
expired, he refused to resign the throne to his brother.
Polynices consequently invoked the aid of Adrastus, king of
Argos, and thus originated the famous war of the Seven against
Thebes (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 68-69 and n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 69).  The
prayer of Oedipus was now answered, for in the course of the war
Polynices and Eteocles killed each other in single combat.  Their
bodies were burned on the same funeral pyre, but so intense was
the hatred between them, even after death, that the flame from
the pyre divided in two as it ascended.  For his description of
the divided flame, Dante probably drew on Statius, ^Theb.~ XII,
429-32, 441:

     Ecce iterum fratres: primos ut contigit artus
     ignis edax, tremuere rogi et novus advena busto
     pellitur; exundant diviso vertice flammae
     alternosque apices abrupta luce coruscant.
     ............
     ...vivunt odia improba, vivunt.

     Once more behold the brothers: as soon as the devouring fire
     touched the body, the pile shook, and the newcomer is driven
     from the pyre; a flame streams up with double head, each
     darting tongues of flashing light....  Alive, ay, alive is
     that impious hatred.

See also Lucan, ^Phars.~ I, 549-52:

     ...Vestali raptus ab ara
     Ignis, et ostendens confectas flamma Latinas
     Scinditur in partes geminoque cacumine surgit
     Thebanos imitata rogos....

     From Vesta's altar the fire vanished suddenly; and the
     bonfire which marks the end of the Latin Festival split
     into two and rose, like the pyre of the Thebans, with
     double crest.

	|56.  Ulisse~: Ulysses of Ithaca, son of Laertes and
father by Penelope of Telemachus, was one of the principal Greek
heroes in the Trojan War and the hero of Homer's ^Odyssey.~ He
undertook, with Diomedes, to decoy the youthful Achilles away
from the island of Skyros and to steal the Palladium, a wooden
image on the preservation of which the safety of the city of Troy
depended (see vs. 63 and the note), and he is supposed to have
been the originator of the stratagem of the wooden horse by means
of which Troy was taken./ The source of Dante's account of the
death of Ulysses, which the hero himself relates in this canto,
is unknown. It is at variance with the prophecy of Tiresias in
the ^Odyssey~ (XI, 134-37) -- with which Dante had no direct
acquaintance -- whereby a peaceful death from the sea is predicted
for Ulysses (see, however, A. T. Murray's translation, which
reads "death shall come to thee thyself far from the sea," and
his comment on the possible -- and more natural -- translation "from
out the sea").  Dante's account varies also from the story,
current in the Middle Ages, given by the so called Dictys
Cretensis in the ^Ephemeris belli troiani~ VI, 15), of how Ulysses
met his death at the hand of Telegonus, his son by Circe.  It is
possible, as B. Nardi (1949, pp. 153-54) suggests, that Dante's
idea was suggested to him by the voyage in 1291 of the Genoese
brothers Vivaldi, who sailed out past Gibraltar and into the
west, seeking a route to India, and were never heard of again.

	|Diomede~: Diomedes, son of Tydeus and Deipyle, was king
of Argos and one of the famous Greek heroes who fought against
Troy.

	|56-57.  e cos@i insieme...come a l'ira~: Even as Ulysses
and Diomedes together incurred the wrath of God in committing the
fraudulent deeds now to be named, so do they together incur His
punishment by fire.

	|59.  l'agguato del caval~: The famous wooden horse which
the Greeks constructed as a pretended atonement for the Palladium
(see n. to vs. 63) which Ulysses and Diomedes had stolen from
Troy.  The Trojans, taken in by the treacherous story of Sinon, a
Greek who let himself be captured (see ^Inf.~ XXX, 98), dragged
the horse, which was full of armed Greeks, into the midst of the
city.  In the middle of the night Sinon let out his comrades, who
fell suddenly upon the unsuspecting Trojans and thus made
themselves masters of Troy.  Virgil describes these events in the
^Aeneid~ (II, 13-290), but he makes no mention of Diomedes in
connection with the strategy of the horse.  Evidently Dante
understood that Diomedes was involved with Ulysses in this as in
the other events to which the shade of Ulysses now refers.

	|59-60.  che f$e la porta...seme~: The stratagem of the
wooden horse brought about the departure of Aeneas and his band
from fallen Troy and ultimately the founding of Rome by him.

	|61.  Piangevisi~ = ^vi si piange.

	|entro~: Adverb, "within."

	|62.  Deidam@ia~: Daughter of Lycomedes, king of Skyros,
with whom Thetis left her son Achilles, disguised in woman's
clothes, in order that he might not take part in the expedition
against Troy.  After Deidamia had become the mother of Pyrrhus
(or Neoptolemus) by Achilles, the latter, yielding to the
persuasion of Ulysses, who together with Diomedes had penetrated
his disguise, abandoned her and sailed to Troy.  Deidamia died of
grief for him.  Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 65, n. See Statius, ^Achilleid~ I,
536 to II, 26.  In ^Purg.~ XXII, 114, Deidamia is said to be
among those who are in Limbo; hence, since Virgil is himself
consigned to Limbo, he may have knowledge of this story of
Achilles directly from her.

	|63.  Palladio~: The Palladium was a wooden image of
Pallas Athena, said to have been sent from heaven by Jupiter to
Ilus, the legendary founder of Troy, as a gift.  On its
preservation within the walls of Troy was believed to depend the
safety and prosperity of the city.  The theft of the Palladium by
Diomedes and Ulysses is recorded by Virgil (^Aen.~ II, 162-70).

	|67.  facci~ = ^faccia.~

	|niego~: "Denial."

	|69.  del disio~: The desire that Virgil, knowing Dante's
thoughts, then renders articulate in his question to Ulysses, vs.
84.

	|ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|72.  si sostegna~ = ^si astenga.~

	|73.  concetto~ = ^concepito.~

	|74-75.  ch'ei sarebbero schivi...detto~: The traditional
pride and haughtiness of the Greek constitute part of the reason
for Virgil's words here, no doubt; but the fact that Dante is a
modern, of a time and culture remote from those of ancient Greece
and such heroes as these, enters into the matter, too.  Virgil,
poet of ancient Rome, would be much closer to the two Greek
heroes.  Indeed, as Benvenuto observes in his comment on vs. 84:
"Sic est verum quod autor devenerit in cognitionem istorum
mediante Virgilio."  ("Thus it is true that the author made their
acquaintance through Virgil.")  This understanding of the reason
Virgil gives, which has puzzled many commentators, is borne out
in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 33, where Dante is in fact encouraged to speak
with another hero because he is an Italian, i.e., a modern. In
short, Virgil's injunction accentuates the poetic distancing of
the story to be told by Ulysses, helping to raise it to the
loftiness associated with tragedy.  See Virgil's "alta
traged@ia," ^Inf.~ XX, 113; also his "alti versi" in vs.  82 of
the present canto.

	|75.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|78.  audivi~ = ^udii.~

	|80-81.  s'io meritai...s'io meritai...~: The repetition
of "s'io meritai" is highly rhetorical and raised toward the
lofty style of tragedy, while the appeal in itself is an instance
of ^captatio benevolentiae~ ("gaining the good will of another"-
-see ^Inf.~ II, 58-60 and the note), since it concerns the fame
of these two shades in the world of the living, as immortalized
by Virgil in his "alti versi" (vs. 82).  See ^Aen.~ IV, 317 (Dido
to Aeneas): "si bene quid de te merui" ("if ever I deserved well
of thee").

	|84.  perduto~: The meaning of "perduto" can be
understood on the purely literal level in the light of its use in
medieval romance.  As Scartazzini-Vandelli points out, a knight
who has not returned from an adventurous voyage and is presumed
dead is described as "lost."  On this word see also P. Rajna
(1920), pp. 224-27.  Only in retrospect will the reader know that
"perduto" can bear another meaning here (see ^Purg.~ I, 131-32.)

	|gissi~ = ^si g@i (si and@o~).

	|85.  Lo maggior corno~: As elsewhere in the poem,
greater moral stature is signified by greater physical size.
Cf., for example, ^Inf.~ X, 33, 53; XIII, 32; XVIII, 83.

	|la fiamma antica~: The adjective too serves to distance and
remove to a focus of great antiquity the action to be narrated.

	|87.  come quella cui vento affatica~: When the reader
learns that it is a whirlwind ("turbo," vs. 137) that sends the
hero and his companions to their death, this simile acquires
greater meaning.  See Horace's use of "laborant" to describe a
wind in the following passage from the ^Odes~ (II, ix, 6-8):

     ...aut Aquilonibus
     querqueta Gargani laborant
     et foliis viduantur orni...

     Nor are Garganus' oak groves always lashed by the blasts of
     the North and the ash trees reft of their leaves.

	|88.  menando~ = ^dimenando.~

	|89.  come fosse la lingua~: See ^Inf.~ XXVII, 16-18,
where the manner in which the voice finds its way up through the
flame is indicated more precisely.  The principle of
^contrapasso~ is evident in the punishing flame's being likened
to a tongue, for the sin punished in this ^bolgia~ is fraudulent
counsel -- false advice given by the tongue.

	|90-120.  Quando mi diparti'...canoscenza~: Among the
possible sources for Dante's conception of Ulysses is a passage
in Cicero, ^De fin.~ V, xviii, 48-49:

     Videamus animi partes, quarum est conspectus illustrior;
     quae quo sunt excelsiores, eo dant clariora indicia naturae.
     Tantus est igitur innatus in nobis cognitionis amor et
     scientiae ut nemo dubitare possit quin ad eas res hominum
     natura nullo emolumento invitata rapiatur.  Videmusne ut
     pueri ne verberibus quidem a contemplandis rebus
     perquirendisque deterreantur?  ut pulsi recurrant?  ut aliquid
     scire se gaudeant?  ut id aliis narrare gestiant?  ut pompa,
     ludis atque eiusmodi spectaculis teneantur ob eamque rem vel
     famem et sitim perferant?  Quid vero?  qui ingenuis studiis
     atque artibus delectantur, nonne videmus eos nec valetudinis
     nec rei familiaris habere rationem omniaque perpeti ipsa
     cognitione et scientia captos et cum maximis curis et
     laboribus compensare eam quam ex discendo capiant
     voluptatem?  Mihi quidem Homerus huiusmodi quiddam vidisse
     videtur in iis quae de Sirenum cantibus finxerit.  Neque
     enim vocum suavitate videntur aut novitate quadam et
     varietate cantandi revocare eos solitae qui
     praetervehebantur, sed quia multa se scire profitebantur, ut
     homines ad earum saxa discendi cupiditate adhaerescerent.
     Ita enim invitant Ulixem....Vidit Homerus probari fabulam
     non posse si cantiunculis tantus irretitus vir teneretur;
     scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido
     patria esse cariorem.  Atque omnia quidem scire
     cuiuscumquemodi sint cupere curiosorum, duci vero maiorum
     rerum contemplatione ad cupiditatem scientiae summorum
     virorum est putandum.

     Let us consider the parts of the mind, which are of nobler
     aspect.  The loftier these are, the more unmistakable
     indications of nature do they afford.  So great is our
     innate love of learning and of knowledge, that no one can
     doubt that man's nature is strongly attracted to these
     things even without the lure of any profit.  Do we [not]
     notice how children cannot be deterred even by punishment
     from studying and inquiring into the world around them?
     Drive them away, and back they come.  They delight in
     knowing things; they are eager to impart their knowledge to
     others; pageants, games and shows of that sort hold them
     spell-bound, and they will even endure hunger and thirst so
     as to be able to see them.  Again, take persons who delight
     in the liberal arts and studies; do we not see them careless
     of health or business, patiently enduring any inconvenience
     when under the spell of learning and of science, and repaid
     for endless toil and trouble by the pleasure they derive
     from acquiring knowledge?  For my part I believe Homer had
     something of this sort in view in his imaginary account of
     the songs of the Sirens.  Apparently it was not the
     sweetness of their voices or the novelty and diversity of
     their songs, but their professions of knowledge that used to
     attract the passing voyagers; it was the passion for
     learning that kept men rooted to the Sirens' rocky shores.
     This is their invitation to Ulysses....Homer was aware that
     his story would not sound plausible if the magic that held
     his hero immeshed was merely an idle song! It is knowledge
     that the Sirens offer, and it was no marvel if a lover of
     wisdom held this dearer than his home.  A passion for
     miscellaneous omniscience no doubt stamps a man as a mere
     dilettante; but it must be deemed the mark of a superior
     mind to be led on by the contemplation of high matters to a
     passionate love of knowledge.

Cicero continues with many illustrious examples of men who felt
an overwhelming desire for knowledge.  See also Horace,
^Epistles~ I, ii, 17-26:

     Rursus, quid virtus et quid sapientia possit,
     utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulixen,
     qui domitor Troiae multorum providus urbes
     et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor,
     dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa
     pertulit, adversis rerum immersabilis undis.
     Sirenum voces et Circae pocula nosti;
     quae si cum sociis stultus cupidusque bibisset,
     sub domina meretrice fuisset turpis et excors,
     vixisset canis immundus vel amica luto sus.

     Again, of the power of worth and wisdom he has set before us
     an instructive pattern in Ulysses, that tamer of Troy, who
     looked with discerning eyes upon the cities and manners of
     many men, and while for self and comrades he strove for a
     return across the broad seas, many hardships he endured, but
     could never be o'erwhelmed in the waves of adversity.  You
     know the Sirens' songs and Circe's cups; if, along with his
     comrades, he had drunk of these in folly and greed, he would
     have become the shapeless and witless vassal of a harlot
     mistress -- would have lived as an unclean dog or a sow that
     loves the mire.

Compare Seneca, ^Epist.  mor.~ LXXXVIII, 7:

     Quaeris, Ulixes ubi erraverit, potius quam efficias, ne nos
     semper erremus? Non vacat audire, utrum inter Italiam et
     Siciliam iactatus sit an extra notum nobis orbem, neque enim
     potuit in tam angusto error esse tam longus; tempestates nos
     animi cotidie iactant et nequitia in omnia Ulixis mala
     inpellit.

     Do you raise the question, "Through what regions did Ulysses
     stray?" instead of trying to prevent ourselves from going
     astray at all times? We have no leisure to hear lectures on
     the question whether he was sea-tost between Italy and
     Sicily, or outside our known world (indeed, so long a
     wandering could not possibly have taken place within its
     narrow bounds); we ourselves encounter storms of the spirit,
     which toss us daily, and our depravity drives us into all
     the ills which troubled Ulysses.

	|91-93.  Circe...nomasse~: The enchantress Circe was the
daughter of Helios, god of the Sun, and Perse, a nymph.
According to legend, she dwelt on the island of Aeaea (in
Virgil's time Circaeum Promontorium, modern Mount Circeo, a
mountain and promontory on the north side of the Gulf of Gaeta;
see n. to vs. 92).  She had the power to transform men into
beasts (see ^Aen.~ VII, 10-20, 189-91).  When Ulysses was cast up
on her island (^Odyssey~ X, 135), she changed his men into swine.
But Ulysses, protected against enchantment by a magic root,
forced her to change them back.  He then lived with Circe (by
whom he had a son, Telegonus) for a year before continuing on his
voyage.

	|92.  Gaeta~: Gaeta, ancient Caieta, seaport of central
Italy in the south of Latium, is situated on a promontory at the
head of the Gulf of Gaeta, on the Tyrrhenian coast, about forty-
five miles northwest of Naples.  It was named by Aeneas for
Caieta, his nurse, who had died there.  See ^Aen.~ VII, 1-4:

     Tu quoque litoribus nostris, Aeneia nutrix,
     aeternam moriens famam, Caieta, dedisti;
     et nunc servat honos sedem tuus, ossaque nomen
     Hesperia in magna, si qua est ea gloria, signat.

     Thou, too, Caieta, nurse of Aeneas, hast by thy death given
     deathless fame to our shores; and still thine honour guards
     thy resting-place, and in great Hesperia, if such glory be
     aught, thy name marks thy dust.

See also Ovid, ^Metam.~ XIV, 157: "Litora adit nondum nutricis
habentia nomen."  (" [Aeneas] landed on a shore which did not
yet bear his nurse's name.")

	|94.  pieta~: Piety, "duty."

	|100.  l'alto mare aperto~: The western Mediterranean.

	|101.  sol con un legno~ = ^con un sol legno.~

	|compagna~ = ^compagnia.~

	|102.  diserto~: "Abandoned."

	|103.  L'un lito e l'altro~: The European and the African
shores of the western Mediterranean.

	|103-105.  infin la Spagna...bagna~: Ulysses looks first to
the traditional western boundary of the habitable world -- to Spain
and Morocco -- and then in his narrative comes back to Sardinia
("l'isola d'i Sardi").

	|104.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|105.  e l'altre che quel mare intorno bagna~: Dante may
have believed that the western Mediterranean contained more
islands than it actually does.  Several medieval ^mappae mundi~
so represent it; see, for example, the Hereford Map in K. Miller
(1896), fold-out following p. 54.

	|106.  Io e ' compagni eravam vecchi e tardi~: The verse
implies that Ulysses' voyage of exploration was long and hard.
See Ovid, ^Metam.~ XIV, 436: "resides et desuetudine tardi"
("grown sluggish and slow through inactivity").

	|107.  quella foce stretta~: The Strait of Gibraltar.
Note the following passage from Orosius, ^Hist.~ I, ii, 7:
"Europae in Hispania occidentalis oceanus termino est, maxime ubi
apud Gades insulas Herculis columnae visuntur et Tyrrheni maris
faucibus oceani aestus inmittitur."  ("The Western Ocean forms the
boundary of Europe in Spain at the very point where the Pillars
of Hercules stand near the Gades [Cadiz] Islands and where the
Ocean tide comes into the straits of the Tyrrhenian Sea.")

	|108-109.  Ercule segn@o li suoi riguardi...metta~: The
Pillars of Hercules usually are considered to be the promontory
of Abyla (in Arabic, Jebel Musa) in North Africa and that of
Calpe (Gibraltar) in Spain, so called from the tradition that
they were originally one mountain, which was torn asunder by
Hercules.  They were supposed to mark the western limit beyond
which no one could sail and come back alive.  Brunetto Latini
(^Tresor~ I, cxxiii, 23) says:

     Iki est la fins de la terre, selonc ce que les ancienes gens
     proverent; et meismement le tesmoignent li tertre de Calpe
     et de Albinna (ou Ercules ficha ses colombes quant il venki
     tote la terre), ou leu ou la nostre mer ist de la mer
     ocheaine, et s'en vient parmi ces. ii.  mons (ou sont les
     illes Gades et les colombes Ercules)....

     Here [in Spain] is the land's boundary, as the ancients
     proved; moreover, this is confirmed by Mount Calpe and Mount
     Abyla (where Hercules established his columns when he
     conquered the entire earth), at the place where our sea
     flows from the ocean and makes its way between these two
     mountains (where the Gades Islands and the Columns of
     Hercules are located) ....

See the ^Tesoretto~, vss. 1043-52 (in G. Contini, 1960, vol.  II,
p. 212):

     E io, ponendo mente
     l@a oltre nel ponente
     apresso questo mare,
     vidi diritto stare
     gran colonne, le quale
     vi pose per segnale
     Ercol@es lo potente,
     per mostrare a la gente
     che loco sia finata
     la terra e terminata...

     And I turned my thoughts out there toward the west.  After
     this sea I saw standing straight great columns, which were
     put there as signals by the mighty Hercules, to show people
     that the earth ends there and terminates.

The Pillars of Hercules are actually shown on the Hereford Map
(see K. Miller, 1896, fold-out following p. 54).

	|109.  pi@u oltre non~: This phrase echoes the familiar
Latin ^ne plus ultra.~  Moreover, the verb "si metta" is in the
present: the injunction holds good in the present, is addressed
to man now and always.

	|110.  Sibilia~: Seville (see the form "Sobilia" in
^Inf.~ XX, 126).  As Porena points out, Villani (VII, 11) calls
the Strait of Gibraltar the "stretto di Sibilia" ("Strait of
Seville").

	|111.  Setta~: Ceuta (Latin Septa), city in North
Africa, in Morocco, opposite Gibraltar.  It is situated on a
peninsula that juts out from the mainland, and it forms the
eastern extremity of the Strait of Gibraltar.  Its name is
derived from its seven hills, the highest of which, Mount Acho,
often is identified with the ancient Abyla, the southernmost of
the two Pillars of Hercules.  As B. Nardi (1949, p. 153) points
out, a chronicle of Dante's time mentions Ceuta in connection
with the expedition of the Vivaldi brothers referred to in n. to
vs. 56: Jacopo d'Oria, ^Annales Ianuenses~ for the year 1291,
speaks of their journey as "versus strictum Septe, ut per mare
occeanum irent" ("toward the strait of Septa, passing from the [
Mediterranean] sea into the ocean").  On the Vivaldi expedition,
see F. M. Rogers (1955), pp. 35-45.

	|112-120.  O frati...canoscenza~: See Aeneas' speech to
his company in ^Aen.~ I, 198-203:

     O socii (neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum),
     o passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem.
     vos et Scyllaeam rabiem penitusque sonantis
     accestis scopulos, vos et Cyclopia saxa
     experti; revocate animos maestumque timorem
     mittite...

     O comrades -- for ere this we have not been ignorant of
     evils-O ye who have borne a heavier lot, to this, too, God
     will grant an end!  Ye drew near to Scylla's fury and her
     deep-echoing crags; ye have known, too, the rocks of the
     Cyclopes; recall your courage and put away sad fear.

See also Lucan, ^Phars.~ I, 299: "Bellorum o socii, qui mille
pericula" ("men who have fought and faced...the peril ...a
thousand times") and Horace, ^Odes~ I, vii, 25-26: "Quo nos
cumque feret melior fortuna parente, / ibimus, o socii
comitesque!" ("Whithersoever Fortune, kinder than my sire, shall
bear us, thither let us go, O friends and comrades!")

	|115.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|ch'@e del rimanente~: Cf. the Latin ^quae de reliquo est.~  E.
G. Parodi (1957, p. 358) comments on Dante's use of this phrase and
gives two examples of it in Old French.

	|del rimanente~: Cf. the OFr ^de remenant.~

	|116-117.  non vogliate negar...gente~: For an earlier
expression of a similar aspiration, see the ^Alexandreis (X~,
5307-12, col. 569) of Walter of Ch#atillon, a French poet of the
twelfth century who wrote in Latin:

	Nunc quia nil mundo peragendum restat in isto, Ne tamen
adsuetus armorum langueat usus; Eia, quaeramus alio sub sole
iacentes Antipodum populos, ne gloria nostra relinquat Vel virtus
quid inexpertum, quo crescere possit, Vel quo perpetui mereatur
carminis odas.

     Now since there is nothing more left of the world to be
     traversed, lest weapons so used to war should grow rusty,
     come, let us seek those who dwell under another sun, on the
     other side of the world, lest our glory should fade and our
     courage miss a chance to shine; this way, an immortal song
     will be our reward.

Torraca (1895, p. 154) notes that the poem was known to Arrigo
da Settimello at the end of the twelfth century and the Faentine
chronicler Tolosano in the first part of the thirteenth century;
thus it was in circulation in Dante's time.

	In the geography of Dante's ^Commedia~, Jerusalem is at
the center of the northern hemisphere, which is of land and has
India at its eastern limit and Gibraltar at its western
("l'occidente," vs. 113).  The other, southern hemisphere is
composed entirely of water, except for the mountain-island of
Purgatory, which rises directly opposite Jerusalem on the orb of
the earth (as will be made clear in the poem).  See Fig. 2, p.
35.  Ulysses' use of the phrase "mondo sanza gente" (vs. 117)
reflects the common belief that the hemisphere of water was
uninhabited.

	|117.  di retro al sol~: Following after the sun in its
westward course.

	|118.  la vostra semenza~: "Your [human] origin."
Ulysses exhorts his companions to remember that they are men,
endowed by nature with intellect and the possibility of gaining
knowledge.

	|119.  fatti non foste~: The accent falls effectively on
"foste." Ulysses, pagan though he is, speaks of man as created,
quite as if he knew Genesis.

	|119-120.  fatti non foste...canoscenza~: See ^De vulg.
eloqu.~ I, xii, 4: "Siquidem illustres heroes Federicus Cesar et
benegenitus eius Manfredus, nobilitatem ac rectitudinem sue forme
pandentes, donec fortuna permansit, humana secuti sunt, brutalia
dedignantes."  ("But those illustrious heroes Frederick Caesar and
his happy-born son Manfred, displaying the nobility and
righteousness of their character, as long as fortune remained
favourable, followed what is human, disdaining what is bestial.")
On "virtue and knowledge," see Horace, ^Epistles~ I, ii, 17
(quoted in n. to vss. 90-120).  Also see ^Conv.~ I, i, 1-2:

     S@i come dice lo Filosofo nel principio de la Prima
     Filosofia, tutti li uomini naturalmente desiderano di
     sapere.  La ragione di che puote essere ed @e che ciascuna
     cosa, da providenza di prima natura impinta, @e inclinabile
     a la sua propria perfezione; onde, acci@o che la scienza @e
     ultima perfezione de la nostra anima, ne la quale sta la
     nostra ultima felicitade, tutti naturalmente al suo
     desiderio semo subietti.  Veramente da questa nobilissima
     perfezione molti sono privati per diverse cagioni....

     As saith the philosopher in the beginning of the First
     Philosophy, "All men by nature desire to know"; the reason
     whereof may be, that each thing, impelled by its own natural
     foresight, inclines to its own perfection; wherefore,
     inasmuch as knowledge is the distinguishing perfection of
     our soul, wherein consists our distinguishing blessedness,
     all of us are naturally subject to the longing for it.  Yet
     of this most noble perfection many are bereft, for divers
     causes.

As Chimenz points out, virtue and knowledge were
pagan ideals that related to the practical and intellectual
spheres of human activity.

	|120.  canoscenza~ = ^conoscenza.~

	|121-122.  aguti...al cammino~: "Keen on the journey" (cf.
the Latin ^acuere~, "to sharpen").

	|124.  volta nostra poppa nel mattino~: Their course is
westward at first, hence the poop is turned to the east; but to
phrase it as Dante does is to convey Ulysses' resolute turning of
his back on all the known world, to face toward the unknown and
follow "the course of the sun" (vs. 117).

	|125.  de' remi facemmo ali~: The ship is large enough to
be worthy of the open sea and equipped with oarsmen (who are not
mentioned among Ulysses' companions, but whose presence is taken
for granted).  Ulysses and his comrades, in their eagerness now
to journey into the unknown, do not wait for favorable winds, but
cause the oars to be plied.  For ^fare ali~, see ^Aen.~ III, 520:
"Temptamusque viam et velorum pandimus alas."  ("[We] venture on
our way, and spread the wings of our sails.")  Also see
Propertius, ^Elegies~ IV, vi, 47: "Classis centenis remiget
alis."  ("Their fleet is winged, each ship, with an hundred
oars.")

	|al folle volo~: Ulysses is speaking in retrospect and with
full knowledge of the disastrous end of his journey, which the reader
does not yet know; but, given the context, "folle" points back to the
folly of disregarding Hercules' markers and the injunction of ^ne plus
ultra~ represented by them.  Later in the poem, Dante looks down upon
Gibraltar from a lofty vantage point in the heavens, as he journeys
upward with Beatrice, and again the adjective "folle" is used to
describe Ulysses' journey.  See ^Par.~ XXVII, 82-83.

	|126.  sempre acquistando dal lato mancino~: "Gaining
always on the left" with respect to their original westward
direction (vs. 124), hence sailing to the southwest, which will
finally bring them to a point opposite Jerusalem on the orb of
the earth -- i.e., to the exact center of the southern hemisphere
of water.  See Fig. 2, p. 35.

	|127-128.  Tutte le stelle...basso~: "L'altro polo" is the
Antarctic.  The subject is "Night" (personified), the objects
"all the stars" and "our [pole]"; the stars of our pole are
understood, particularly the North Star.  This means that the
ship now has crossed the equator as it continues in its
southwesterly course.

	|130-131.  Cinque volte racceso...luna~: The light on the
underside -- the earthward side -- of the moon had five times been
lighted and five times extinguished (the moon had waxed and waned
that many times): five months had passed.

	|132.  che 'ntrati~ = ^che intrati.~

	|alto passo~: See ^Inf.~ I, 26-27; II, 12.

	|133.  n'apparve~ = ^ci apparve.~

	|una montagna~: What this unexpected land is, looming dark
through the distance here in the hemisphere of water where there was
thought to be no land, will be disclosed in the ^Purgatorio.~

	|134-135.  parvemi alta tanto...alcuna~: The reason why
this would be the highest mountain Ulysses had ever seen is not
made evident until the ^Purgatorio.~

	|parvemi~ = ^mi parve.~

	|136.  e tosto torn@o in pianto~: The subject of the verb
is understood to be "our great joy."

	|138.  del legno il primo canto~: The prow of the ship.

	|139-142.  Tre volte il f$e girar...richiuso~: See ^Aen.~
I, 114-17:

     ...ingens a vertice pontus
     in puppim ferit; excutitur pronusque magister
     volvitur in caput; ast illam ter fluctus ibidem
     torquet agens circum et rapidus vorat aequore
     vertex...

     A mighty toppling wave strikes astern. The helmsman is
     dashed out and hurled head foremost, but the ship is thrice
     on the same spot whirled round and round by the wave and
     engulfed in the sea's devouring eddy.

	|140-141.  levar la poppa...ire~: "F$e" (^fece~) is
understood with the verbs "levar" and "ire."

	|141.  com' altrui piacque~: "Altrui" is dative (with the
verb ^piacere~) and here, in English usage, may bear a capital
initial letter to denote the Deity.  This (see "folle volo," vs.
125) is uttered in retrospect.  Ulysses now knows what he did not
know at the time.
