	|1.  Cos@i~:  Proceeding through the darkness with Virgil.

	|primaio~ = ^primo.~  Limbo is reckoned as the first of the
nine circles of Hell, even though in another sense it lies outside of
Hell proper.  Perhaps Limbo is best regarded as "marginal," as the name
itself ("hem," "border") implies.  The presence of Minos as judge of
sins "at the entrance" (vs. 5) clearly marks the beginning of Hell
proper, where actual sin is punished.

	|2.  men loco~:  Since Hell is funnel-shaped, each
successive circle in the descent is smaller in circumference than
the one above it.

	|3.  punge a guaio~:  "Goads to pain" that causes the
spirits to wail, in contrast to those in Limbo who only sigh
(^Inf.~ IV, 26).  For "guaio," see ^Inf.~ III, 22; IV, 9.

	|4.  Stavvi~ = ^vi sta.~

	|Min@os~:  Minos in legend and myth was a king of ancient
Crete, son of Zeus and Europa, and brother of Rhadamanthus.  In
assigning to Minos the office of judge in Hell, Dante imitates Virgil
(^Aen.~ VI, 432-33): "Quaesitor Minos urnam movet; ille silentum /
conciliumque vocat, vitasque et crimina discit."  ("Minos, presiding,
shakes the urn; 'tis he calls a court of the silent, and learns men's
lives and misdeeds.")  In Dante's usage, Greek proper names are
regularly stressed on the last syllable, since this was thought to be
the standard Greek accentuation.  See "Semiram@is" (vs. 58) and
"Par@is" (vs. 67).

	|ringhia~:  "Snarls."  The word is often used of dogs and
implies a show of fangs.

	|7.  mal nata~:  The term, applied repeatedly to the
damned in Hell, suggests that "it would be better for them not to
have been born" (see Matt. 26:24).  In the ^Vita nuova~ (XIX, 8),
the souls of Hell are addressed, "O, malnati."  The contrary term
"bene nato" (^Par.~ V, 115) is addressed to one assured of
salvation.

	|8.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|9.  le peccata~:  A type of collective feminine plural
(originally neuter plural) not uncommon in Italian.

	|11.  cignesi~ = ^si cigne (cinge).~  Minos wraps his tail
about himself as many times as the number of the level down to
which the damned soul is to be sent.  From the phraseology in the
poem it is not clear whether Minos' tail is long enough to be
wrapped around himself continuously in nine convolutions, or
whether he twines it around himself a first time, then a second,
and so on.  The early illustrators do not reveal any certainty of
interpretation, nor does ^Inf.~ XXVII, 124-29 clear up the
matter.

	|15.  dicono e odono~:  They confess their sins and then
hear sentence pronounced on them.

	|18.  cotanto offizio~:  The importance of Minos' function
is stressed: he is the sole judge of all the souls who enter
Hell, and he sentences each to its just place of punishment.

	|19.  cui~ = ^chi.~

	|fide~ = ^fidi.~

	|20.  l'ampiezza de l'intrare~:  Since the entrance to
Hell proper is here where Minos stands as judge and there is, in
fact, no portal at all, the "entrance" is very wide indeed.  See
Matt.  7: 13: "Intrate per angustam portam, quia lata porta et
spatiosa via est quae ducit ad perditionem, et multi sunt qui
intrant per eam."  ("Enter by the narrow gate.  For wide is the
gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many
there are who enter that way.")  See also ^Aen.~ VI, 126-27.

	|21-24. Perch$e pur gride?...e pi@u non dimandare~: "Pur"
implies persistence ("why do you persist in shouting these
challenges") and recalls Charon's shout to the wayfarer (^Inf.~
III, 88-93), and now Virgil repeats to Minos the same formula he
had used there with the boatman (^Inf.~ III, 95-96).

	|22.  fatale andare~:  The journey of Aeneas to the
netherworld was also "by decree of the gods"; see ^Aen.~ VI,
461-62.

	|25.  Or incomincian~:  Shifts to the vivid present are
common in the narrative style of the poem.

	|27.  mi percuote~:  The phrase anticipates the buffeting
of the wind in this circle.

	|28.  d'ogne luce muto~:  Deprived ("mute") of all light.
For a similar merging of the visual and the auditory, see ^Inf.~
I, 60: "dove 'l sol tace."

	|34.  Quando giungon davanti a la ruina~:  The reader must
wait for clarification of this matter.  Why is there a "ruin"
(which seems to mean a breakdown in the rock structure of Hell)
in this circle?  And why should the lamentation of the damned
souls be louder here as they pass before the ruin?  The point at
which the poem throws light on this will be duly noted.
Meanwhile a sense of mystery prevails.

	|36.  la virt@u divina~:  "The Divine Power" that condemns
them to such torment.

	|38.  enno~ = ^sono.~

	|39.  talento~:  "Desire," "appetite"; specifically,
"carnal appetite," since this is the circle of ^lussuria~ or
lust.

	|40-49. E come li stornei... E come i gru...~:  The two
similes comparing the souls to birds are strictly functional: the
first conveys the helter-skelter movement of the "wide flight" of
souls; the second disposes them in single file so that they may
pass in review and be noted and named.

	|40.  stornei~ = ^stornelli.~  Grammatically, "ali" is the
subject of the verb and "stornei" is the object, thus paralleling
the second part of the simile where "fiato" (vs. 42) is the
subject of the verb and "spiriti" the object.

	|41.  nel freddo tempo~:  In late autumn, birds such as
starlings are seen gathering in great flocks, wheeling about in
flight (see M. Barbi, 1927, pp. 126-127).  The suggestion of
autumn and of winter's coming continues (see ^Inf.~ III, 112) and
extends here into the simile of the cranes (vss. 46-47),
contributing the tone of sadness and melancholy commonly
associated with these seasons.  Indeed, the cumulative effect of
such touches as these establishes for the ^Inferno~ a mood that
is impressively different from that of the ^Purgatorio~ or the
^Paradiso.~

	|44-45. nulla speranza... di minor pena~:  The object of
greater desire is rest or peace ("posa"), and peace is precisely
what is forever denied these souls.  Francesca's own words will
reveal her longing for peace (see n. to vs. 99).

	|46.  lai~:  The term entered the Romance languages with
the Breton ^lais~ but commonly implied a lament by Dante's time
(see A. Schiaffini, 1937b).

	|48.  traendo guai~:  The phrase ^trarre guai~ ("to utter
wails") is common in early Italian.

	|52-60. La prima di color... corregge~:  Semiramis is
the Greek name of a queen of ancient Assyria.  She was famous for
her beauty and licentiousness as well as for her prowess in war.
According to legend, she was married to Ninus, succeeded to his
power, and ruled the Assyrian empire for forty-two years.  During
her reign she is said to have founded many cities, including
Babylon, and to have conquered many others.  Her reputation for
beauty, charm, and sexual excesses supports the view that she was
identified in some legends with the goddess Ishtar.  The
description of Semiramis in the poem is taken directly from
Paulus Orosius, one of Dante's chief historical sources.  See
Orosius, ^Hist.~ I, iv, 4, 7-8:

         [Nino] mortuo Samiramis uxor successit... haec, libidine
    ardens, sanguinem sitiens, inter incessabilia et stupra et
    homicidia, cum omnes quos regie arcessitos, meretricie habitos
    concubitu oblectasset occideret, tandem filio flagitiose
    concepto, impie exposito, inceste cognito privatam ignominiam
    publico scelere obtexit.  Praecepit enim, ut inter parentes ac
    filios nulla delata reverentia naturae de coniugiis adpetendis ut
    cuique libitum esset liberum fieret.

         [Upon the death of Ninus,] his wife Semiramis succeeded him
    on the throne...  Burning with lust and thirsty for blood,
    Semiramis in the course of continuous adulteries and homicides
    caused the death of all those whom she had delighted to hold in
    her adulterous embrace and whom she had summoned to her by royal
    command for that purpose.  She finally most shamelessly conceived
    a son, godlessly abandoned the child, later had incestuous
    relations with him, and then covered her private disgrace by a
    public crime.  For she prescribed that between parents and
    children no reverence for nature in the conjugal act was to be
    observed, but that each should be free to do as he pleased.

Dante obviously has borrowed several phrases from Orosius.
Dante's words "libito f@e licito" (vs. 56) -- which were borrowed in
turn by Chaucer and applied to Nero: "His lustes were al lawe in
his decree" (^Monk's Tale~, vs. 2477) -- are an exact translation
of Orosius' "ut cuique libitum esset liberum fieret."  The
statement "si legge / che succedette a Nino e fu sua sposa" (vss.
58-59) points directly to Orosius' words "[Nino] mortuo Samiramis
uxor successit."  In the ^De monarchia~, Dante also mentions the
careers of Semiramis and Ninus (Orosius -- ^Hist.~  II, iii, I -- put
their combined reigns at more than ninety years), and cites
Ovid's allusion to them in the story of Pyramus and Thisbe
(^Metam.~ IV, 58, 88).  See ^De mon.~ II, viii, 3-4.

	|60.  tenne la terra che 'l Soldan corregge~:  Egypt, in
Dante's time, was under the Sultan's rule.  Apparently Dante
confused Babylonia, a kingdom of the Assyrian empire, with
Babylon (Old Cairo), a fortified city on the Nile.  Dante's
confusion of Babylonia and Babylon is not unique.  Boccaccio, for
example, describes Saladin as "il soldano di Babilonia"; see
^Decam.~ I, 3 (vol. I, p. 44, ll. 27-28) and X, 9 (vol. II, p.
292, l. 16).  Benvenuto, in his commentary on the ^Commedia~,
takes notice of Dante's confusion of the two places, but suggests
the poet meant to imply that Semiramis extended her empire to
include Egypt as well as Assyria.  For other theories, see E. G.
Parodi (1957), pp. 343-347

	|61-62. L'altra @e colei... Sicheo~:  Dido, also called
Elissa, was a daughter of Belus, king of Tyre, and the sister of
Pygmalion.  She married Sichaeus, who later was murdered by
Pygmalion for his wealth.  When the shade of Sichaeus revealed
Pygmalion's crime to Dido, she fled from Tyre and sailed across
to Africa where, according to legend, she founded Carthage.  In
the ^Aeneid~, Virgil makes Dido a contemporary of Aeneas, with
whom she falls in love despite her vow to remain faithful to her
dead husband.  When Aeneas leaves Carthage for Italy, Dido, in
despair, stabs herself and dies on a funeral pyre of her own
making.  Dante's reference to the unfaithful Dido is an evident
reminiscence of ^Aen.~ IV, 552: "Non servata fides cineri
promissa Sychaeo."  ("The faith vowed to the ashes of Sichaeus I
have not kept.")

	|63.  Cleopatr@as~:  Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, mistress of
Julius Caesar and of Mark Antony, was famous for her beauty and
seductive ways.  Lucan (^Phars.~ X, 60-62) compares her to Helen
of Troy.

	|64.  Elena~:  Helen, wife of Menelaus, the Spartan king.
Her abduction by Paris led to the long Trojan War.  Like Dante,
Beno#it de Sainte-Maure (^Roman de Troie~, vss. 28426-33) also
blames Helen:

     Par cui li monz a trait tel peine,
     Par cui Grece est si apovrie
     De la noble chevalerie,
     Par cui li siegles est peior,
     Par cui li riche e li meillor
     Sont mort, vencu e detrenchi$e,
     Par cui sont li regne eissilli$e,
     Par cui Troie est arse e fondue.

Because of her, the world has had such trouble; because of her,
Greece is so impoverished of her noble knighthood; because of
her, the world is worse; because of her, the rich and best are
dead, vanquished, and cut to pieces; because of her, kingdoms
have been devastated; because of her, Troy is burned and
destroyed.

	|65-66. Achille~:  Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan
War.   Dante's allusion to his death refers not to the Homeric
story but rather to the accounts of the Trojan War current in the
Middle Ages.  According to this medieval version of the story,
Achilles was killed by treachery in the temple of Apollo
Thymbraeus in Thymbra, to which Paris lured him by the promise of
a meeting with Polyxena, with whom Achilles was in love (see
Dictys Cretensis, ^Ephemeris belli Troiani~ IV, 11; and Dares
Phrygius, ^De excidio Troiae~ XXXIV).

	|67.  Par@is~:  Paris, son of Priam and Hecuba, known in
Greek mythology as most handsome of all mortal men, was appointed
umpire to decide who was the fairest of the three goddesses,
Juno, Minerva, or Venus.  He chose Venus, who had promised to
reward him with Helen, most beautiful woman in the world.  His
abduction of Helen led to the Trojan War, during which he killed
Achilles and, later on, received the wound from which he
ultimately died.  Benvenuto points out the special propriety of
the position Dante assigns to Paris in Hell:

     Hic autor immediate post Achillem locat Paridem
     occisorem eius.  Hic certe potest dici miles Veneris,
     potius quam Martis... adiudicavit pomum Veneri,
     spreta Pallade et Iunone.  Sic iuvenis amorosus, neglecta
     sapientia et opulentia, ponit pomum, idest summum
     bonum, in venerea voluptate.

     Here, immediately after Achilles, the author places
     Paris, his murderer.  Surely, Paris may be called a
     soldier of Venus rather than of Mars... he awarded
     the apple to Venus, spurning Pallas and Juno.  Thus
     amorous youth, disdaining wisdom and opulence,
     places the apple, which is the highest good, in sensual
     pleasure.

The coupling of Paris and Tristan -- and of Helen and Isolde -- as
typical instances of lovers whose woes were wrought by love was a
poetic commonplace in the Middle Ages.  Chaucer, for instance, in
the ^Parliament of Fowls~ (vss. 290-291), couples "Tristram,
Isaude, Paris, and Achilles, / Eleyne, Cleopatre, and Troylus,"
and in the ^Prologue~ to the ^Legend of Good Women~ (vss.
254-255) he says: "Hyde ye youre beautes, Ysoude and Eleyne: / My
lady cometh, that al this may disteyne."  In the ^Roman de
Renart~, Paris and Tristan are similarly coupled, as are Helen
and Isolde in a work by Eustache Deschamps, the contemporary and
friend of Chaucer.  All four lovers are introduced together in
the following passage from a thirteenth-century manuscript
belonging to the Ashburnham collection:

     Li corteis Tristam fu enginn$e
     De l'amor et de l'amist$e
     Ke il out envers Ysolt la bloie.
     Si fu li beau Paris de Troie
     De Eleine e de Penelop$e.

The courteous Tristan was deceived by the love and friendship he
bore Isolde the fair, just as the handsome Paris of Troy was by
Helen and Penelope.

	|Tristano~:  Tristan, lover of Isolde.  There are several
medieval versions of the Tristan story in both poetic and prose forms
dating from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.  The death
of Tristan as Dante probably was familiar with it is told in the OFr
prose romance, ^Roman de Tristan.~

	|mille~:  Often used, as here, to denote an approximate number,
"a great many," "a multitude"; see also ^Inf.~ VIII, 82.

	|68.  mostrommi~ = ^mi mostr@o.~

	|nominommi~ = ^mi nomin@o.~

	|69.  ch'amor di nostra vita dipartille~:  This whole
encounter with those "who died of love" is reminiscent of Aeneas'
visit in the underworld (see ^Aen.~ VI, 440-476) to the lovers in
the Mourning Fields and the myrtle grove, "quos durus amor
crudeli tabe peredit" ("those whom stern Love has consumed with
cruel wasting," vs. 442).

	|dipartille~ = ^le dipart@i.~  The relative "che" is the direct
object, and "le" is redundant.

	|71.  nomar~ = ^nominare.~

	|75.  e paion s@i al vento esser leggieri~:  This suggests
that these two spirits are more violently tossed by the wind than
the others are.  According to the principle of just punishment,
the heightened violence of the wind signifies that the love,
which led them in life and leads them now, was, and is, most
passionate.

	|78.  i~ = ^li.~

	|ei~ = ^elli.~

	|81.  s'altri nol niega~:  In Hell the name of God is
avoided or is uttered only in blasphemy.

	|82-84. Quali colombe... portate~:  The simile in its
main features seems derived from the ^Aeneid~, but in other
respects is strikingly altered.  See ^Aen.~ V, 213-217:

     qualis spelunca subito commota columba,
     cui domus et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi,
     fertur in arva volans plausumque exterrita pinnis
     dat tecto ingentem, mox aere lapsa quieto
     radit iter liquidum celeris neque commovet alas.

     Even as, if startled suddenly from her cave, a dove
     whose home and sweet nestlings are in the rocky
     coverts, wings her flight to the fields and, frightened
     from her home, flaps loudly with her wings; soon,
     gliding in the peaceful air, she skims her liquid way
     and stirs not her swift pinions.

	|83.  al dolce nido~:  See Virgil, ^Georg.~ I, 414:
"dulcisque revisere nidos" ("to see once more their sweet
nests").

	|85.  la schiera ov' @e Dido~:  This second mention of
Dido -- this time by name -- invites us to remember Virgil's heroine
and her tragic love, as we listen to Dante's "heroine" tell of
her own.  In a sense Dante is vying with Virgil here.

	|88.  animal~:  "Living creature," as in ^Inf.~ II, 2.

	|89.  perso~:  See ^Conv.~ IV, xx, 2: "Lo perso @e uno
colore misto di purpureo e di nero, ma vince lo nero, e da lui si
dinomina."  ("Perse is a colour mingled of purple and of black,
but the black predominates, and it is called after it.")

	|90.  tignemmo~ = ^tingemmo~ (from ^tingere).~

	|94.  vi piace~:  The shift to the plural is significant.
Francesca begins to address both Dante and Virgil now.

	|95.  voi~:  On the admissibility of such imperfect rhymes
as ^voi-fui~ (see vs. 97), see Petrocchi, vol. I, ^Introduzione~,
p.  471.

	|96.  mentre che 'l vento, come fa, ci tace~:  The
function of "ci" here is uncertain, since it can be the pronoun
meaning "to us" and, by implication, "within us," or it can be
the adverb meaning "here."  Thus, either the wind could hush "for
us," i.e., for Francesca and her lover, and so allow them to
hover before Dante and Virgil while she tells her story (see C.
Schick, 1955), or the wind could hush "here," i.e., in this place
before Dante and Virgil where Francesca and her lover have been
given a brief respite that makes it possible for her to speak
(see M. Barbi, 1934b, pp. 263-64).  Essentially the meaning is
the same in either case.  Divine Providence may cause the wind to
"be silent" for the special benefit of the wayfaring Dante, so
that he may hear of this sinful and tragic love; or Divine
Providence may allow this pair to come out of the wind to where
Dante and Virgil stand unassailed by the blast.

	|97. la terra~:  Ravenna a city on the Adriatic coast of
Emilia between the Po and the Rubicon. Although originally it was
only about a mile from the coast, the city now is about five
miles inland, owing to the retreat of the sea.

	|dove nata fui~:  The soul that speaks is not named until vs.
116, where she is addressed simply as Francesca.  Francesca da Rimini,
as she is known, was the daughter of Guido da Polenta the elder, lord
of Ravenna (d. 1310), and the aunt of Guido Novello, Dante's host at
Ravenna; Francesca married -- possibly ^ca.~ 1275-- Gianciotto (see n.
to vs. 107).  No contemporary chronicle or document mentions the love
between Francesca and Paolo (see n. to vs. 101) or their death, as
Dante has Francesca relate it.  The earlier commentators merely give
the names of the three.  For Boccaccio's account of the story, see
below.  E. G. Parodi (1920, p. 63) notes that even the date of the
tragic event is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 1283 to 1286.

	According to the accepted story, Francesca, betrothed to
Gianciotto for political reasons, fell in love with his younger
brother Paolo, who had acted as his proxy at the betrothal, and
shortly after the marriage was surprised with him by Gianciotto,
who immediately killed them both.  In reality, however, at the
time of their tragic death -- if it took place ^ca.~
1285-- Francesca had a nine-year-old daughter by Gianciotto, and
Paolo, who was about forty and had been married some sixteen
years, was the father of two sons.

	The story of the two lovers as told by Boccaccio, in his
^Comento~, is greatly expanded and embroidered nicely to
exculpate Francesca as much as possible:

          @E adunque da sapere che costei fu figliuola di messer Guido
     Vecchio da Polenta, signor di Ravenna e di Cervia; ed essendo
     stata lunga guerra e dannosa tra lui e i signori Malatesti da
     Rimino, addivenne che per certi mezzani fu trattata e composta la
     pace tra loro.  La quale accioch@e pi@u fermezza avesse, piacque a
     ciascuna delle parti di volerla fortificare per parentado; e 'l
     parentado trattato fu che il detto messer Guido dovesse dare per
     moglie una sua giovane e bella figliuola, chiamata madonna
     Francesca, a Gianciotto, figliuolo di messer Malatesta.  Ed
     essendo questo ad alcuno degli amici di messer Guido gi@a
     manifesto, disse un di loro a messer Guido: -- Guardate come voi
     fate, percioch@e, se voi non prendete modo ad alcuna parte, che in
     questo parentado egli ve ne potr@a seguire scandolo.  Voi dovete
     sapere chi @e vostra figliuola, e quanto ell'@e d'altiero animo: e,
     se ella vede Gianciotto, avanti che il matrimonio sia perfetto,
     n@e voi n@e altri potr@a mai fare che ella il voglia per marito.  E
     perci@o, quando vi paia, a me parrebbe di doverne tener questo
     modo: che qui non venisse Gianciotto ad isposarla, ma venisseci
     un de' frategli, il quale come suo procuratore la sposasse in
     nome di Gianciotto. --  Era Gianciotto uomo di gran sentimento, e
     speravasi dover lui dopo la morte del padre rimanere signore; per
     la qual cosa, quantunque sozzo della persona e sciancato fosse,
     il disiderava messer Guido per genero pi@u tosto che alcuno de'
     suoi frategli.  E, conoscendo quello, che il suo amico gli
     ragionava dover poter avvenire, ordin@o segretamente che cos@i si
     facesse, come l'amico suo l'avea consigliato.  Per che al tempo
     dato, venne in Ravenna Polo, fratello di Gianciotto, con pieno
     mandato ad isposare madonna Francesca.  Era Polo bello e
     piacevole uomo e costumato molto; e, andando con altri
     gentiliuomini per la corte dell'abitazione di messer Guido, fu da
     una damigella di l@a entro, che il conoscea, dimostrato da un
     pertugio d'una finestra a madonna Francesca, dicendole:
     -- Madonna, quegli @e colui che dee esser vostro marito; -- e cos@i
     si credea la buona femmina; di che madonna Francesca incontanente
     in lui pose l'animo e l'amor suo.  E fatto poi artificiosamente
     il contratto delle sponsalizie, e andatane la donna a Rimino, non
     s'avvide prima dell'inganno, che essa vide la mattina seguente al
     d@i delle nozze levare da lato a s@e Gianciotto: di che si dee
     credere che ella, vedendosi ingannata, sdegnasse, n@e perci@o
     rimovesse dell'animo suo l'amore gi@a postovi verso Polo.  Col
     quale come ella poi si giugnesse, mai non udii dire, se non
     quello che l'autore ne scrive; il che possibile @e che cos@i fosse.
     Ma io credo quello essere pi@u tosto fizione formata sopra quello
     che era possibile ad essere avvenuto, ch@e io non credo che
     l'autore sapesse che cos@i fosse.  E perseverando Polo e madonna
     Francesca in questa dimestichezza, ed essendo Gianciotto andato
     in alcuna terra vicina per podest@a, quasi senza alcun sospetto
     insieme cominciarono ad usare.  Della qual cosa avvedutosi un
     singulare servidore di Gianciotto, and@o a lui, e raccont@ogli ci@o
     che della bisogna sapea, promettendogli, quando volesse, di
     fargliele toccare e vedere.  Di che Gianciotto fieramente
     turbato, occultamente torn@o a Rimino, e da questo cotale, avendo
     veduto Polo entrare nella camera da madonna Francesca, fu in quel
     punto menato all'uscio della camera, nella quale non potendo
     entrare, ch@e serrata era dentro, chiam@o di fuora la donna, e die'
     di petto nell'uscio.  Per che da madonna Francesca e da Polo
     conosciuto, credendo Polo, per fuggire subitamente per una
     cateratta, per la quale di quella camera si scendea in un'altra,
     o in tutto o in parte potere ricoprire il fallo suo; si gitt@o per
     quella cateratta, dicendo alla donna che gli andasse ad aprire.
     Ma non avvenne come avvisato avea, percioch@e, gittandosi gi@u,
     s'appicc@o una falda d'un coretto, il quale egli avea indosso, ad
     un ferro, il quale ad un legno di quella cateratta era; per che,
     avendo gia la donna aperto a Gianciotto, credendosi ella, per lo
     non esservi trovato Polo, scusare, ed entrato Gianciotto dentro,
     incontanente s'accorse Polo esser ritenuto per la falda del
     coretto, e con uno stocco in mano correndo l@a per ucciderlo, e la
     donna accorgendosene, accioch@e quello non avvenisse, corse oltre
     presta, e misesi in mezzo tra Polo e Gianciotto, il quale avea
     gi@a alzato il braccio con lo stocco in mano, e tutto si gravava
     sopra il colpo: avvenne quello che egli non avrebbe voluto, cio@e
     che prima pass@o lo stocco il petto della donna, che egli
     aggiugnesse a Polo.  Per lo quale accidente turbato Gianciotto,
     s@i come colui che pi@u che se medesimo amava la donna, ritirato lo
     stocco da capo, fer@i Polo e ucciselo: e cos@i amenduni lasciatigli
     morti, subitamente si part@i e tornossi all'uficio suo.  Furono
     poi li due amanti con molte lacrime, la mattina seguente,
     seppelliti e in una medesima sepoltura.

          You must know that she was the daughter of Guido da
     Polenta the elder, lord of Ravenna and Cervia.  A long, harsh war
     had raged between him and the Malatesta, lords of Rimini, when
     through certain intermediaries, peace was treated and concluded.
     To make it all the more firm, both sides were pleased to cement
     it with a marriage.  Whereupon it was arranged that Messer Guido
     was to give his beautiful young daughter, called Madonna
     Francesca, in marriage to Gianciotto, son of Messer Malatesta.
     When this became known to some friends of Messer Guido, one of
     them said to him:

          "Be careful how you proceed, for if you do not take
     precautions, this wedding may bring scandal.  You know your
     daughter, and how high-spirited she can be.  If she sees
     Gianciotto before the marriage is concluded, neither you nor
     anyone else can make her go through with it.  And so, by your
     leave, it seems to me that you ought to go about it in this way.
     Do not let Gianciotto come here to marry her, but rather one of
     his brothers who, as his representative, will marry her in
     Gianciotto's name."

          Gianciotto was a very capable man, and everyone expected
     that he would become ruler when his father died.  For this
     reason, though he was ugly and deformed, Messer Guido wanted him
     rather than one of his brothers as a son-in-law.  Recognizing
     that what his friend had told him was true, he secretly ordered
     that his advice be carried out.  So that, at the agreed-upon
     time, Paolo, Gianciotto's brother, came to Ravenna with a full
     mandate to marry Francesca in Gianciotto's name.

          Paolo was a handsome, pleasing, very courteous man.  As
     he was walking together with some other gentlemen about the
     courtyard of Messer Guido's home, he was pointed out through a
     window to Madonna Francesca by a young handmaiden inside, who
     recognized him and said to her: "Madonna, that is the man who is
     to be your husband." The good woman said it in good faith.
     Whereupon Madonna Francesca immediately fell completely in love
     with him.

          The deceptive marriage contract was made, and the lady
     went to Rimini.  Nor did she become aware of the deception until
     the morning after the wedding day, when she saw Gianciotto
     getting up from beside her.  Whereupon she realized she had been
     fooled, and, as can well be believed, she became furious.  Nor
     did the love she had conceived for Paolo disappear.  I have never
     heard tell how they then got together, other than what [Dante]
     writes; and it is possible that it did happen that way.  But I
     believe that that is probably a fiction constructed upon what
     might possibly have happened; and that the author did not know
     what really took place.

          In any case, the feelings of Paolo and Francesca for each
     other were still very much alive when Gianciotto went off to some
     nearby town as ^podest@a.~  With almost no fear of suspicion, they
     became intimate.  But a certain servant of Gianciotto found them
     out, went to Gianciotto, and told him all he knew, promising to
     give him palpable proof should he want it.  Gianciotto,
     completely enraged, returned secretly to Rimini.  When the
     servant saw Paolo entering Francesca's room, he immediately went
     to get Gianciotto and brought him to the door of the room.  Since
     it was bolted from within and he could not enter, he shouted to
     her and began to push against the door.

          Paolo and Francesca recognized him immediately.  Paolo
     thought that if he fled quickly through a trapdoor that led to a
     room below, he might conceal his misdeed, in whole or in part.
     He threw himself at it, telling the woman to go open the door.
     But it did not happen as he had planned.  As he jumped through, a
     fold of the jacket he was wearing got caught on a piece of iron
     attached to the wood.  Francesca had already opened the door for
     Gianciotto, thinking she would be able to make excuses, now that
     Paolo was gone.  Whereupon Gianciotto entered and immediately
     noticed Paolo caught by the fold of his jacket.  He ran, rapier
     in hand, to kill him.  Seeing this, Francesca quickly ran between
     them, to try to prevent it; but Gianciotto had already raised his
     rapier, which he now brought down with all his weight behind it.

          And thus happened what he would not have wanted: before
     reaching Paolo, the blade passed through Francesca's bosom.
     Gianciotto, completely beside himself because of this accident --
     for he loved the woman more than himself -- withdrew the blade,
     struck Paolo again, and killed him.  Leaving them both dead, he
     left, and returned to his duties.  The next morning, amidst much
     weeping, the two lovers were buried in the same tomb.

	|99.  per aver pace co' seguaci sui~:  Peace (see "posa,"
vs. 45), the condition most longed for by these souls eternally
tossed on the infernal wind is that which, in punishment, is
eternally denied them.  Francesca expresses her longing for peace
in the circumlocution by which she indicates the city of her
birth.  Does the river seek peace of its tributaries ("seguaci")
as if they were so many pursuers?  In the whole turn of phrase
there is a rich ambiguity, which the internal "rhyme" (^pace...
seguaci~) serves to reinforce.  It should be remembered that the
she-wolf of the first canto (^Inf.~ 1, 58) was a "bestia sanza
pace."

	|100-108.  Amor... Amor... Amor...~:  The anaphora frames
and sets off two fateful laws of love and their tragic
consequences.  "Love kindles quickly in the gentle heart";
accordingly, Paolo cannot escape feeling the fire of love in his
own heart.  "Love absolves no loved one from loving in return";
accordingly, Francesca must love him who loves her.  In declaring
these ineluctable laws, Francesca speaks the language of the cult
of courtly love, whose god, Love, is all-powerful.  In adducing
the ineluctability of love, moreover, Francesca pleads her own
excuse: neither she nor Paolo was responsible, for, as she
implies, none may withstand Love's power.  The perverseness of
such love (cf. the "mal perverso" of vs. 93) from the point of
view of Christian doctrine is evident.

	|100.  Amor, ch'al cor gentil ratto s'apprende~:
Francesca's language, and especially her reference to the "cor
gentil," is indeed that of courtly love.  The verse recalls the
famous ^canzone~ of Guido Guinizelli that begins (see G. Contini,
1960, vol. II, p. 460): "Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore /
come l'ausello in selva a la verdura."  ("Love always repairs to
the gentle heart, as the bird in the wood to the verdure.")
|s'apprende~:  "Catches fire."  The term frequently had this
meaning; see Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ III, 10 (vol. I, p. 262, l. 2):
"Avvenne che un fuoco s'apprese in Capsa."  ("It came to pass that
a fire broke out in Capsa.")

	|101.  costui~:  Paolo Malatesta, who is not named here or
elsewhere in the poem.  He was the third son of Malatesta da
Verrucchio; Malatestino and Gianciotto (see n. to vs. 107) and
Pandolfo were his brothers.  Paolo, said to have been handsome
and attractively mannered, was married in 1269 to Orabile
Beatrice, by whom he later had two sons.  On Paolo's tragic love
for Francesca, see n. to vs. 97.

	|102.  e 'l modo ancor m'offende~:  Gianciotto apparently
surprised the two lovers and killed them immediately, leaving
them no time for repentance; hence, the "manner" of her death
still offends Francesca (cf. "anime offense," vs. 109).  Another
interpretation (see A. Pagliaro, 1953, pp. 333-353) would refer
the phrase not to the manner of the murder but to the intensity
of Paolo's passion, suggested by Francesca's words (vss.
100-101): "Amor... / prese costui de la bella persona."  However,
this view seems farfetched and this meaning extremely unlikely in
the context, despite the apparent correspondence of "ancor
m'offende" (vs. 102) and "ancor non m'abbandono" (vs. 105) cited
in support of it.

	|103.  Amor, ch'a nullo amato amar perdona~:  Francesca's
second law of love echoes a dictum which the cult of courtly love
characteristically had taken over from Christian doctrine.  See I
Ioan.  Apos. 4:19: "Nos ergo diligamus Deum, quoniam Deus prior
dilexit nos."  ("Let us therefore love, because God first loved
us.")  Thus Fra Giordano da Rivalto sermonizes (^Prediche~ XLV,
1831 edn., vol. II, p.  78): "Non @e nullo che, sentendosi che sia
amato da alcuno, ch'egli non sia tratto ad amar lui
incontanente."  ("There is no one who, feeling himself loved,
will not immediately feel drawn to love in return.")  See also
Andreas Capellanus, ^De amore~ II, 8 (p. 311): "Amor nil posset
amori denegare."  ("Love can deny nothing to love.")

	|104.  mi prese~:  With this echo of the "prese costui" of
vs. 101, the parallel application of the two laws of love becomes
most evident.

	|del costui piacer~ = ^del piacer di costui.~ "Costui" is the
genitive form here.  "Piacer" probably is intended to correspond to the
"bella persona" of vs. 101.  Thus, Paolo falls in love with the
beautiful Francesca, and Francesca falls in love with the handsome
Paolo.  ^Piacer~, like the Proven$cal ^plazer~, often means "charm,"
"attraction."  See M.  Barbi (1932), pp. 10-11.  It would corroborate
this second law of love more precisely, however, if "piacer" here meant
instead Paolo's "pleasure" in Francesca, his love for her, the pleasure
he took in her charm.  Neither meaning can be ruled out, since the
poetic ambiguity can support one or the other.

	|106.  Amor condusse noi ad una morte~:  The third verse
of the anaphora fatefully seals the doom of the two lovers, as if
Love himself had pronounced the decree; "una morte" seems to
unite these lovers in that moment of death and forever
thereafter.

	|107.  Caina attende chi a vita ci spense~:  Gianciotto is
awaited in Caina (or so Francesca believes and even hopes), but
the reader must wait to learn the meaning of that place in lower
Hell.   Gianciotto (^Gian ciotto~ = "crippled John"), husband of
Francesca, was Giovanni Malatesta, second son of Malatesta da
Verrucchio, lord of Rimini (called "il mastin vecchio" in ^Inf.~
XXVII, 46).  Gianciotto appears to have been a man of brutish
exterior, but was valiant and able.  He died in 1304, before both
his father and his older brother, Malatestino ("il mastin
nuovo").  On Gianciotto's tragic marriage to Francesca, see n. to
vs. 97.

	|108.  ci fuor porte~ = ^ci furono portate.~  Truncated past
participles (^porte = portate~) are common in Italian.

	|109-120.  Quand' io intesi... disiri~:  The
"interruption," focusing on the wayfarer as a pensive and
compassionate listener, and then the further question,
momentarily relax the pitch of the sentiment so that it can
attain an even higher climax.

	|109.  quell' anime offense~:  The adjective in the
context of the wayfarer's compassion would mean "wretched,"
"suffering"; yet it is Divine Justice that punishes or "offends"
these sinners, and Divine Justice scarcely can be said to "do
offense."  Thus, there is a meeting here of two perspectives,
human and divine, which adds a dramatic dimension to this episode
and to the ^Inferno~ as a whole.

	|111.  pense = pensi.~

	|114.  al doloroso passo~:  To their death.  "Passo" in a
similar though more metaphorical sense appears in ^Inf.~ I, 26;
see also "alto passo" in ^Inf.~ II, 12, where "passo" refers to
the passage from the world of the living to the world of the
dead.

	|116.  Francesca~:  She is named only now, and her lover
is not named at all -- true indications that the poet is presenting
a ^cause c$el@ebre.~

	|118.  d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|119.  a che e come concedette amore~:  The questioner
Dante has entered into the spirit of Francesca's words and joins
her in speaking the language of courtly love.  It was Love, as
she had said, that brought the lovers to "one death"; and it is
Love, he therefore assumes, who allows the lovers to manifest
their desire.

	|120.  conosceste~:  The verb is plural; the question
concerns both souls.

	|i dubbiosi disiri~:  Given the context of the two
perspectives, human and divine, this adjective, like "offense" in vs.
109, is rich in ambiguity.  ^Dubbioso~, referring to the desire of
lovers, can mean "hesitant," "not yet manifested," i.e., desire of
which neither lover is wholly conscious (see M. Barbi, 1932, p. 16).
But ^dubbioso~ can also mean "dangerous," "that which is to be feared";
cf. the verb "dubbiar" in ^Purg.~ XX, 135.

	|121-123.  Nessun maggior dolore... miseria~:  A number of
antecedents to Francesca's words have been noted.  See, for
example, Augustine, ^Conf.~ X, 14: "Aliquando et e contrario
tristitiam meam transactam laetus reminiscor, et tristis
laetitiam."  ("Sometimes on the contrary, in joy do I remember my
forepassed sorrow, and in sadness my joy.")  See also Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 36, a. 1, ad 4: "Memoria
praeteritorum bonorum, inquantum fuerunt habita, delectationem
causat: sed inquantum sunt amissa, causant tristitiam."
("Recollection of past goods in so far as we have had them,
causes pleasure; in so far as we have lost them, causes sorrow.")
But much closer is Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ II, iv, ll. 3-6:
"Sed hoc est quod recolentem vehementius coquit.  Nam in omni
adversitate fortunae infelicissimum est genus infortunii fuisse
felicem."  ("But this is that which vexeth me most, when I
remember it.  For in all adversity of fortune it is the most
unhappy kind of misfortune to have been happy.")

	|123.  e ci@o sa 'l tuo dottore~:  Virgil's "misery" is his
confinement to Limbo without hope of attaining the "good of
intellect."

	|124-126.  Ma s'a conoscer... dice~:  See ^Aen.~ II, 10,
12-13:

     sed si tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros
     .............................................
     quamquam animus meminisse horret luctuque refugit,
     incipiam....

Yet if thou hast such longing to learn our disasters... though my
mind shudders to remember, and has recoiled in grief, I will
begin.

	|127.  Noi leggiavamo un giorno per diletto~:  Stories of
King Arthur and the Arthurian heroes were very popular in Dante's
time; see P. Rajna (1920).  Other allusions in Dante's writings
include ^De vulg. eloqu.~ 1, x, 2: "Arturi regis ambages
pulcerrime" ("the exquisite legends of King Arthur"), and the
"prose di romanzi" of ^Purg.~ XXVI, 118.  See also ^Par.~ XVI,
14-15, which is, in fact, a reminiscence of ^Lancelot du Lac.~

	|128.  Lancialotto~:  Lancelot of the Lake, the hero of
the romance ^Lancelot du Lac~, in which he is styled "la flor des
cheualiers del monde" ("the flower of the knighthood of the
world").  At the court of King Arthur the famous knight became
enamored of Arthur's queen, Guinevere; in consequence of this
guilty love, Lancelot failed in his quest for the Holy Grail.
For the OFr manuscript version of the ^Lancelot du Lac~, see P.
Toynbee (1902), pp. 10-37.

	|129.  sanza alcun sospetto~:  It is possible to
understand this to mean "without reason to fear that anyone might
surprise us," thus reinforcing the "soli"; but it seems better,
given the context, to understand "knowing nothing," i.e.,
"unaware of the love we already felt for one another."  It is the
^reading~ itself that reveals their love to them and in this
sense is their "go-between": hence the book as "Gallehault" (see
n. to vs. 137).

	|133.  il disiato riso~:  Guinevere's lips, her smiling
mouth.   Note the corresponding but impressively stark "bocca" of
vs. 136.

	|134.  basciato~ = ^baciato.~

	|135.  questi, che mai da me non fa diviso~:  As if the
kiss had sealed their doom and had bound them together for
eternity.

	|fia~ = ^sar@a.~

	|136.  basci@o~ = ^baci@o.~

	|137.  Galeotto~:  Gallehault (not to be confused with
Galahad) was one of the characters in the OFr ^Lancelot du Lac.~
Called "Roy d'outre les marches" ("king from beyond the
marshes"), he made war on King Arthur, but by the intervention of
Lancelot was induced to come to terms.  During Gallehault's
residence at King Arthur's court a warm friendship developed
between him and Lancelot, who confided his love for Queen
Guinevere.  Gallehault arranged for the two to meet.  In the
course of this interview, Gallehault urged the queen to kiss
Lancelot -- and so began the guilty love between those two.  From
the part he played on this occasion, the name of Gallehault
("galeotto"), like that of Pandarus ("pander"), became a synonym
for "go-between."

	|141.  morisse~ = ^morissi.~
