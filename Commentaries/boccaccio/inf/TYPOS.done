Bocc  Inf. 9.110-133 (scr. 2)  d intendimenti = d'intendimenti
(FIXED) jvs
Boccaccio, INF. 2.52-120: first screen comes up all boldface.
(FIXED) jvs

Inf. 3, near beginning: "pevenissero" = "pervenissero"

Inf. 9: "ltalia" = "Italia"

These both fixed (10/13/98) by RH; but I could not find these two:

"lcomincia" (should be "incomincia") in Proem, esp. all. (= Inf. I?)

"lsac" (should be "Isac") in Inf. II.
