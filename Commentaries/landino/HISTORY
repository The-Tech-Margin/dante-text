Moved old Inf into directory "Old" and created new subdirs.
Copied the new, complete Landino as a single file from BobH
via STC's Mac into a file named "LANDINO.entire." Then
broke that file into its pieces and saved them into proemio.e
and the new directories. A little textual fixup was needed.  -stc
