	|1-21.~  When the Eagle's denunciation of the kings of Christendom
ceased, the individual lights, flashing into greater brilliance, broke
into song, -- both song and brilliance indicating, apparently, their
approval of the doom pronounced on unrighteous rulers.  At the close of
the song Dante seemed to hear that strange inward murmur of the music
already referred to, as of the clear waters of a river falling from
rock to rock.  [This `murmur of a river which falls clear from rock to
rock' is surely meant to be a contrast to the river of tears -- the
tears of the sinful suffering human race -- that fell down through the
broken body of the Great Old Man of Crete in ^Inf.~ xiv. 94-120, to
form the Rivers of Hell:

     `Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
     Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
     Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
     From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
     Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
     Then downward go along this narrow sluice
     Unto that point where is no more descending.
     They form Cocytus' (Longfellow)].

	|22-36.~  Then the murmur, gathering itself together, rose through
the Eagle's neck and issued in a voice from the beak which spoke forth
the praises of the souls that composed the eye and eyebrow.  It is,
obviously, the utterance of that inward murmur of joy which the whole
company of just rulers take in those who are supreme in justice, or, to
use the poet's figure, who form the eye which sees and endures the Sun
of Righteousness.  Of these supreme spirits there are six: one forming
the very pupil of the eye, the remaining five the circle of the eyelid. 
[The usual understanding of this is that these five form the
semi-circle of the eyebrow, as in Fig. 1.

                                David}
\</pre\>

But the statement in l. 43 that they `make a ^circle~ for the eyelid'
seems to imply the complete round of the eyelid, as in Fig. 2.

\</pre\>

I cannot quite make up my mind between the two arrangements, though I
incline to the latter.  Nothing important depends on the question; but
it is certain that the arrangement indicates the relative importance of
each spirit in Dante's judgment.  E.g. in Fig. 1 Constantine is the
central and highest spirit of the upper arch; in Fig. 2, Hezekiah].  It
may be noted that no mention is made of the other eye.  Dante is
thinking of the Eagle with its head turned to one side as in the
standard of the Roman Empire; and the one eye which is visible to him
is sufficient for his symbolic purpose.  Also, the metrical arrangement
of the passage may be pointed out.  In each case, after naming the soul
in one ^terzina~, he adds another beginning, `Now knoweth he,' -- the
knowledge being what each has learnt in the new heavenly life.

	|37-39.~  1.  The pupil of the eye, that which has power to gaze
directly at the sun, is David, who is described as

               `the singer of the Holy Spirit
     Who transferred the ark from city unto city.'

It is interesting to ask why David, who had nothing to do with the
Roman Empire, is thus set as the very pupil of the eye of the Roman
Eagle.  The answer is found in the ^De Monarchia~ and the ^Convito.~ 
Rome and Israel were to Dante elect nations: the former to establish a
temporal empire, the latter a spiritual.  Hence there must be some
essential connection between the two, -- a connection which Dante finds
in the birth of David being nearly contemporary with the founding of
Rome: `It was at one and the same time that David was born and that
Rome was born; that is, that Aeneas came from Troy into Italy, which
was the origin of the most noble city of Rome, as our books witness. 
Thus the divine election of the Roman Empire is made very evident by
the birth of the holy city, which was contemporaneous with that of the
root from which sprang the race of Mary' [^Conv.~ iv. 5 (Miss
Hillard's trans.)].  The connection here indicated is, to our minds,
an artifical one; but in the passage before us spiritual reasons are
given for making David the pupil of the Eagle's eye.  In the first
place, he was `the singer of the Holy Spirit.'  His righteousness as a
king was by direct inspiration of the Spirit of God, and by the same
inspiration he was able to turn the Divine laws into music: `Thy
statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage' [^Ps.~ cxix.
54].  Further, David `bore the ark from city unto city.'  The
reference is to 2 Samuel vi., where it is told how David brought the
ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion.  On the Terrace of Pride one of
the sculptured scenes of Humility is David dancing before the ark
[^Purg.~ x. 55-69]; but in the present passage the ark is looked at in
its relation to righteous government.  The idea is that David founded
his new capital, Jerusalem, which he had just taken from the Jebusites,
in religion, -- in the ark, which represented the presence and worship
of God in the city.  In short, David is the pupil of the eye, the very
power of vision for the whole Eagle, because through him the revelation
is given to all rulers that there is no civil righteousness save by
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and no stability of cities that is not
founded on the presence and public recognition and worship of God.

	|40-42.~  The knowledge which the heavenly life has brought to
David is specially connected with his inspiration:

     `Now knoweth he the merit of his song,
     So far as `twas effect of his own counsel,
     By the reward which is of equal measure.'

It is obvious that Dante recognizes a human element in the inspiration
of Scripture.  According to the teaching of the Church, the higher
truths cannot be known by the human intellect, `unless it is fortified
by a stronger light, as by the light of faith or prophecy, which is
called the light of grace, forasmuch as it is superadded to nature'
[^Summa~, i-ii. q. 109, a. 1.].  David's merit consisted in his freely
turning his intellect to this ^lumen gratiae~ and receiving its
illumination; and it is the reward of this free acceptance which he now
enjoys in this Heaven.  A passage in the ^De Monarchia~ (iii. 4) shows
that Dante regarded the human element in inspiration as entirely
subordinate to the Divine.  Discussing the question of the
interpretation of Scripture, he exclaims: `Oh worst of crimes, even
though a man commit it in his dreams, to turn to ill use the purpose of
the Eternal Spirit.  Such an one does not sin against Moses, or David,
or Job, or Matthew, or Paul, but against the Eternal Spirit that
speaketh in them.  For though the reporters of the words of God are
many, yet there is one only that tells them what to write, even God,
who has deigned to unfold to us His will through the pens of many
writers' [Church's transl.].

	|43-45.~  2.  Turning now to the circle of the eyelid, the spirit
nearest the beak is the Emperor Trajan, he who `consoled the poor widow
for her son.'  The story as told in the ^Legenda Aurea~ is
as follows.  `In the time that Trajan the Emperor reigned, and on a
time as he went toward a battle out of Rome, it happed that in his way
as he should ride, a woman, a widow, came to him weeping and said: I
pray thee, sire, that thou avenge the death of one my son which
innocently and without cause hath been slain.  The Emperor answered: If
I come again from the battle whole and sound then I shall do justice
for the death of thy son.  Then said the widow: Sire, and if thou die
in the battle who shall then avenge his death?  And the Emperor said:
He that shall come after me.  And the widow said: Is it not better that
thou do to me justice and have the merit thereof of God than another
have it for thee?  Then had Trajan pity and descended from his horse
and did justice in avenging the death of her son' [^The Golden Legend~,
Life of St. Gregory (Caxton's transl.)].  The scene is sculptured on
the Terrace of Pride on Mount Purgatory as an example of Humility [on a
capital of the Ducal Palace in Venice is a similar sculpture: `Trajan
on horseback, armed and holding weapons in his right hand, while the
widow is seen on her knees before him, and below is the inscription:
TRAIANO I{M}PERADORE CHE FE JUSTITIA A LA VEDOVA (Didron's ^Christian
Iconography~, ii. 251)]; and it is set next to the ^bas relief~ of
David dancing before the ark, so that there as here Hebrew king and
Pagan emperor are united in the same virtue.  Dante's idea seems to be
that justice is rooted in humility: a proud and overbearing man would
have swept a poor widow out of his path as he marched to battle.

	|46-48.~  The knowledge which the other world had taught Trajan is
connected with a very curious legend:

     `Now knoweth he how dear it costs
     Christ not to follow, by the experience
     Of this sweet life and of the opposite.'

The mediaeval legend was that St. Gregory, meditating on the humility
and justice of Trajan, prayed God to pardon him; whereupon a voice from
God answered him: `I have now heard thy prayer, and have spared Trajan
from the pain perpetual' [^The Golden Legend~, Life of St. Gregory]. 
The soul of Trajan then `returned to its bones' [^Par.~ xx. 107.  See
below {comm. to vv. 94-117}], believed in Christ, was baptized, and,
dying a second time, passed to this Heaven of Righteous Kings.  The
experience of both Hell and Heaven taught him the cost of not following
Christ: for nearly five hundred years he had not merely suffered the
pains of Hell, but lost the joy of `this sweet life.'  [Trajan died in
117 A.D., and Gregory was Pope 590-604.  Even if Gregory offered up his
prayer for him at the very beginning of his Pontificate, Trajan had
been at that time 473 years in the Inferno, a sufficient time certainly
to teach him `the cost of not following Christ.'  The `not following
Christ,' indeed, sets Trajan's attitude to Christianity in the most
favourable light possible.  Dante seems to ignore deliberately Trajan's
reputation as a persecutor of the early Christians.  Perhaps he was
influenced by a certain humanity and justice which breathe through the
Emperor's instructions to Pliny the Younger, Proconsul of Pontus and
Bithynia: `The Christians are not to be sought out: but if they are
brought up and convicted, they must be punished: yet in such a way
that, if any one denies he is a Christian, and proves what he says by
some deed, such as making offerings to our deities, though he may be
open to suspicion about the past, yet he should be pardoned in
consequence of his repentance.  But indictments put forth anonymously
cannot be admitted in the case of any crime.  For this would be a most
dangerous precedent and incompatible with the age in which we live.' 
Tertullian (^Apology~, 2) ridicules this as Justice `playing a game of
evasion on itself'; but perhaps it is as much as could be expected from
a heathen ruler who was just and humane at heart.] 

	|49-54.~  3.  The next spirit on `the upper arch' of the eyelid is
Hezekiah, king of Judah, of whom it is written that `he did that which
was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father
David did.'  His removal of the high places, breaking of the images,
cutting down of the groves, and restoration of the Temple worship,
doubtless secured him his place of honour in the eyebrow [2 Kings
xviii. 3-7; 2 Chron. xxix. 2 ff., etc.].  It is not this, however, but
his penitence which is chosen for special mention: he is described as
he who

     `Postponed death by a true penitence.'

It certainly appears, as many commentators point out, that Dante has
here fallen into some confusion concerning two separate moments in
Hezekiah's life.  No penitence is mentioned in connection with the
addition of fifteen years to his life.  It is rather the opposite of
repentance: he wept sore, and reminded God that he had walked before
him `in truth and with perfect heart' [2 Kings xx. 3].  It was in
consequence of this that his death was postponed.  On his recovery,
`his heart was lifted up'; and when he `humbled himself for the pride
of his heart,' the wrath of the Lord was stayed during his day.  This
was the occasion of his penitence and its consequence -- not
postponement of the king's own death, but of the execution of judgment
on his country [2 Chron. xxxii. 24-26.  See Moore's ^Studies in Dante~,
1st series, 72].

The special knowledge which Hezekiah has gained in the
heavenly world is the relation of prayer to the Divine providence:

     `Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment
     Is not transmuted because a worthy prayer
     Makes down below to-morrow of to-day,' --

that is, postpones to the future what otherwise would happen in the
present.  It is strange to find Mr. Vernon interpreting this as
meaning nothing more than that Hezekiah died eventually, and thus
discovered that `his prayer did not alter God's decree that he must
die' [^Readings on the Paradiso~, ii. 104.  Yet the author in a
footnote refers to the passage in the ^Summa~ (ii-ii. q. lxxxiii. a. 2)
quoted below in this paragraph, which gives the true idea].  Hezekiah
was never so far deluded as to think that his prayer had made him
immortal upon earth: the promise was for fifteen years.  The reference
is, as already said, to the relation of prayer to the Divine decrees:
if prayers are answered, does not this imply that they have power to
change what has been ordained by God?  Gregory discusses the problem in
a case the exact opposite of that of Hezekiah -- the shortening of life
by prayer.  A certain monk, when his Abbot was dying, prayed that he
might follow him within seven days, and, by the Abbot's intercession,
his prayer was granted.  Was not this a case of altering by prayer
things predestinate of God?  Gregory's reply is, No: `those things
which holy men do by their prayers effect, were from all eternity
predestinate to be obtained by prayers' [^The Dialogues of St.
Gregory~: an Old English Version, Bk. I. chap. viii].  Aquinas,
referring to this passage takes the same view: `We do not pray to alter
the divine plan, but to obtain what God has arranged to be fulfilled by
prayers, "to the end that men by asking may deserve to obtain what God
Almighty before all ages has arranged to give them," as Gregory says'
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. lxxxiii. a. 2.  Comp. the discussion of the same
question in the ^Contra Gentiles~, Bk. III. 95, 96.  The argument is
that prayers, being included as causes in the universal system of
things, will produce effects as other causes do, and are not, any more
than those other causes, to be regarded as an interference with the
universal system.  `To say that we should not pray to gain anything of
God, because the order of His providence is unchangeable, is like
saying we should not walk to get to a place, nor eat to support
life....  One might as well exclude the effects of other every-day
causes as exclude the effect of prayer....  Prayers avail, not as
changing a system arranged from eternity, but as being themselves part
of that system....  Hence Gregory says that God does not change His
Counsel, though He sometimes changes His sentence, not the sentence
which delares His eternal arrangements, but the sentence which declares
the order of inferior causes, according to which Ezechias was to die'
(Father Rickaby, ^Of God and His Creatures~)].  In short, what
Hezekiah now knows in Heaven is the mystery of how prayer harmonizes
with and fulfils `the eternal judgment,' instead of being, as it seems,
an alteration of it.

	|55-60.~  4.  The fourth of these supreme spirits is Constantine
the Great:

     `The next who follows, with the laws and me,
     Under the good intent which bore bad fruit,
     To give place to the Pastor, made himself a Greek.
     Now knoweth he how the ill deduced
     From his good work not to himself is harmful,
     Although the world may thereby be destroyed.'

[The words `made himself a Greek' (l. 57) must mean in Dante's lips
something more than that Constantine transferred his capital to
Byzantium.  The Greeks were the ancient enemies of the Trojans, the
forefathers of the Roman people.  To abandon Rome in order to become a
Greek must have seemed to the poet's passionate patriotism almost the
act of a renegade.  In ^Par.~ vi. 1-3 we have a parallel condemnation
of Constantine for having `turned the Eagle against the course of
heaven' -- that is, back to the East (see {note in comm. to ^Par.~ 6.1-
27}).  The `Great Old Man' of Crete (^Inf.~ xiv. 103 ff.) stands with
his back to the East, and `gazes at Rome as if it were his mirror' --
the Divinely ordained seat of Empire.  See my ^Exiles of Eternity~
{comm. to ^Inf.~ 14.94-119}.]  The reference is to the `Donation of
Constantine,' `the most stupendous of all the mediaeval forgeries,' as
Byrce calls it.  In this document, Constantine, after narrating the
cure of his leprosy by Pope Sylvester, bestows on him and his
successors for ever his `palace, as also the city of Rome and all the
provinces, districts and cities of Italy or of the western regions,' --
he himself withdrawing to `the regions of the East,' to found there a
new capital, because `where the supremacy of priests and the head of
the Christian religion has been established by a heavenly Emperor, it
is not just that an earthly emperor should hold power.'  Dante, of
course, accepted the document as genuine, but argued in the ^De
Monarchia~ that it was beyond the power of Constantine to alienate any
part of the Empire, and equally beyond the power of the Church to
receive it, since her Lord had forbidden her to possess gold or
silver.  The only thing the Emperor had a right to give, or the Church
to receive, was a patrimony to be held by the Vicar of Christ as a
steward for the poor of Christ [^De Mon.~ iii. 10].  In passage after
passage Dante admits Constantine's good intention, while holding firmly
that the gift was the destruction of the world.  It was the beginning
of the lust for wealth and temporal power in the Popes which led to
luxury and simony, arrayed Church and Empire as deadly enemies,
destroyed civil government in Italy, and provoked the feuds of Guelphs
and Ghibellines.  So bitterly did Dante feel this that he regarded the
birth of Constantine as a calamity to the Roman Empire: `Oh happy
people,' he exclaims, `oh Ausonia, how glorious hadst thou been, if
either he, that weakener of thine empire, had never been born, or if
his own pious intention had never deceived him!' [^De Mon.~ ii. 13. 
The following are the chief references in the ^Commedia.~  The cure of
his leprosy by Sylvester (^Inf.~ xxvii. 94: cf. ^De Mon.~ iii. 10): a
lament for the evil wrought by the `marriage-dower' which he gave to
`the first rich Father' -- Sylvester (^Inf.~ xix. 115-117), the
covering of the Chariot of the Church with the Eagle's feathers, the
possessions of the Empire (^Purg.~ xxxii. 124-129.  Cf. the same
imagery for the later Donations of Pepin and Charles, and the monstrous
heads which grew on the Chariot in consequence, ll. 130-147 of same
Canto).  Dante's view was substantially that of the Catharist heretics
who called Sylvester the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, the Son of
Perdition, and traced the ruin of the Church and its downfall from
primitive Christianity to his acceptance of Constantine's Donation
(Tocco's ^L'Eresia nel Medio Evo~, p. 84)].

It is this `pious intention,' however, which helps to form his
paradise.  One might naturally think that the knowledge of the
disastrous consequences of his gift would cast some shadow on his
eternal joy; but it is not so.  Constantine has now learnt that Divine
justice regards nothing but the purity of the motive, `the interior act
of the will.'  In the words of Aquinas, `an event following does not
make an act bad which was good, nor good which was bad; for instance,
if one give alms to a pauper, which he abuses for sin, nothing is lost
to him who did the alms' [^Summa~, i.-ii. q. xx. a. 5.].  It is the
will, says Chrysostom, `which is either rewarded for good or condemned
for evil.'

	|61-66.~  5.  The fourth spirit of the eyelid -- `on the declining
arch' -- is William II., surnamed the Good, King of Sicily and Naples. 
He died in 1189 at the age of thirty-five -- deplored, says the Eagle,
by `the land that weeps for Charles and Frederick yet alive' [another
stroke at Charles the Lame of Naples and Frederick II. of Sicily; see
^Par.~ xix. 127-135, and notes, above {in comm. to ^Par.~ 19.115-148}]. 
According to Villani (iv. 20), `this William honourably and
magnificently ruled the kingdom of Sicily,' and it is said that in his
time `there was more security in the thickets of Sicily than in the
cities of other Kingdoms.'  The body of the good king lies in the
magnificent cathedral of Monreale which he built, and the original
inscription on his tomb was the simple sentence: ^Hic situs est bonus
rex Gulielmus.~  It is possible that Dante had a special favour for him
because he claimed to hold his kingship direct from Christ, instead of
His Vicar.  In the choir of the Cathedral of Monreale a mosaic above
the royal throne shows Christ in the act of placing the crown on
William's head; and Dante would have a natural liking for a king who
put in practice the thesis of his ^De Monarchia.~  [In the church ^La
Martorana~ in Palermo is a similar mosaic of William's grandfather, the
great Roger I., receiving his crown from the hand of Christ.  At the
same time, it is to be remembered that these Norman Kings held their
kingdom in fief of the Holy See, and William the Good, like his father
William the Bad, was an upholder of the Papacy against the Empire.  One
indelible stain rests on his arms -- the frightful atrocities committed
by his soldiers in the sack of Thessalonica in 1185.  Yet so far as
Sicily is concerned, its best days died with him.  Richard flourished
in the realm; every one was contented with his lot; everywhere peace,
everywhere security, the traveller feared not the ambushes of robbers,
nor the sailer of the sea the attacks of pirates' (quoted by Gibbon in
a note to chap. lvi. of the ^Decline and Fall~).]

The greatness of the love of God for a just king is the
special knowledge which Paradise has taught this soul:

     `Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is
     With the just king, and in the outward show
     Of his effulgence he still makes it seen.

The emphasis is on the word `king,' -- justice in a king involving more
virtue than in a private citizen.  `As a higher virtue is required to
rule a family than simply to rule oneself,' says Aquinas in his ^De
Regimine Principum~, `much higher is it to rule a city or kingdom.  It
belongs therefore to surpassing virtue to exercise the office of a King
well.  And hence in bliss he ought to receive a surpassing reward.... 
For a private person is praised by men, and God reckons it to him for
reward, if he succours the needy, brings peace to them at variance,
delivers the oppressed, and, finally, if he confers on any one any sort
of help or counsel for his welfare.  How much more therefore ought he
to be praised by men and rewarded by God who establishes a whole
province in peace, restrains violence, administers justice, and by his
laws and precepts directs what is to be done by men?  For in this way
also the greatness of a King's virtue appears in that he specially
bears the likeness of God, for he performs in his kingdom what God does
in the world, whence in Exodus (xxii.) the judges of a multitude are
called gods.  But so much the more acceptable is any one to God in the
degree that he approximates to His likeness, and hence the Apostle
warns in Ephesians (v. 1):  "^Be ye imitators of God as most dear
sons.~"  ...So it may be taken as true that the king's reward is an
eternal honour and glory.  For what worldly and perishable honour can be
compared to this honour, that a man be a citizen and friend of God, and
reckoned among his sons, and may attain with Christ to the heirship of
the heavenly kingdom?  [^De Reg. Prin.~ Bk. I. chaps. viii. ix.
(O'Neill's transl.)].  It is the burning joy of this reward of a just
king that Dante sees flashing from this fourth spirit of the eyebrow.

	|67-72.~  6.  The quotation just given throws into relief the fifth
and last spirit of the circle of the eyelid, for if heaven is thus
enamoured of a just king, how great must have been the justice of a
private citizen when it was counted worthy to rank with emperors and
kings in the eternal bliss!  It is the soul of the Trojan Rhipeus, of
whom we know nothing beyond what an incidental allusion in the ^Aeneid~
suggests.  Aeneas tells Dido that he was among the fallen in the
terrible night of the sack of Troy:

               `Cadit et Rhipeus, iustissimus unus
     Qui fuit in Teucris, et servantissimus aequi:
     Dis aliter visum.'

[^Aen.~ ii. 426-428: `Rhipeus too falls, the most just man among the
Trojans, and the strictest keeper of equity: to the gods it seemed
otherwise.'  `Dis aliter visum' can scarcely mean that the gods mistook
his character, and, thinking him unjust, slew him in the fight.  Virgil
has the natural feeling that a truly just man ought to be under the
special protection of the gods, but that often, for some mysterious
reason, it seems otherwise to their larger vision, and the justest of
men appears to perish.  It is at this point the Christian poet takes up
the problem of the heathen poet, and solves it by showing the glory to
which Rhipeus passed when he fell in the horrors of that night.  This,
in short, is the `otherwise' as it `seemed' to the Eternal Justice.] 
It is undoubtedly to these lines that Rhipeus owes his place in
Paradise -- a place inconceivable to earthly minds:

     'Who would believe, down in the errant world,
     That e'er the Trojan Rhipeus in this round
     Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?
     Now knoweth he enough of what the world
     Has not the power to see of grace divine,
     Although his sight may not discern the bottom.'

Dante is here satisfying his own hunger for the salvation of the
heathen; but it is not without meaning that it is the Trojan that is
chosen.  Mr. Gardner is undoubtedly right in saying that `Dante's main
object is clearly to indicate that the race whom he regards as the
ancestors of the Roman People were not without divine light' [^Dante's
Ten Heavens~, p. 149].  The justest citizen among the ancient race,
and the justest Emperor among their descendants, are chosen out of the
heathen world as examples of a Divine grace which overflows the bounds
of the ordinary means of salvation, according to the astonished words
of St. Peter: `Of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of
persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
righteousness, is accepted with him' [Acts x. 34, 35].

The most important point in all this may be easily overlooked. 
It is, I think, the transference of the mystery from the ^justice~ of
God to His ^grace~ in the salvation of the heathen.  We saw how Dante
questioned the justice of God in the condemnation of virtuous heathen
who never heard of Christ, and was silenced by the statement that the
Divine judgments are a great deep, too profound for human eyes.  And
now he starts the other side, and draws great comfort from it: God's
grace is as unfathomable as His justice.  If His justice holds in it
strange condemnations of the heathen, His grace contains equally
mysterious salvations of them.  This seems plainly to be the idea. 
Rhipeus, for all that Paradise has taught him of the Divine grace by
which he was saved, cannot discern the bottom of it; and to this
unfathomableness Dante returns in ll. 118-120:

               `That grace which from so deep
     A fountain wells that never creature thrust
     The eye as far as to its primal wave.'

	|73-78.~  Further, when the Eagle has finished its description of
the souls that form the eye, Dante compares it to a lark that sings and
then is silent in contentment with `the last sweetness' of its song. 
Now, `the last sweetness' is just this closing statement of
the unfathomableness of the Divine grace. 

	|79-93.~  The thought that the grace of God was as profound a deep
as His justice, and that out of it might flow marvellous salvations of
heathen souls like Trajan and Rhipeus, was to Dante so surprising and
overpowering that an involuntary cry broke from his lips: `What things
are these?'  Whereupon the Eagle proceeds to explain the cause of his
astonishment.

	|94-117.~  In the first place, it tells Dante he was mistaken in
thinking that Trajan and Rhipeus `issued from their bodies' as
^Gentiles~;  they were both Christians firmly believing, one in the
future, the other in the past, sufferings of Christ.  In the case of
Trajan `the kingdom of heaven suffered violence' [Matt. xi. 12] -- the
violence of `warm love and living hope' which conquers the Divine will,

               `because it willeth to be conquered, 
     And, conquered, conquers with its own benignity.' 

The `living hope' is that Pope Gregory.  We must remember, of course,
that hope in the Catholic faith means specifically `the hope of glory'
in the eternal world.  What Gregory hoped for was the everlasting
blessedness of a soul in Hell.  So long as it remained there it could
`never return to a good will' (ll. 106, 107), and therefore never could
be saved.  There must be a stupendous miracle of resurrection: the
soul of Trajan must `return to its bones' (l. 107), the bones must be
clothed with flesh (l. 113), and a sufficient space of time given for
the gaining of faith in Christ.  All this happened, according to the
story already told.  Trajan's soul remained a short space in the flesh,
believed in Christ,

     `And in believing was kindled into such a fire
     Of true love, that at the second death
     Worthy it was to come unto this mirth.'

This is the violence of `warm love' referred to in line 95, -- violence
which passes unhurt through `the second death,' takes the kingdom of
heaven by force, and enters in as `one born out of due time.'  The
obvious meaning is that God's grace is not bound to flow only in
ordinary and conventional channels.  It requires nothing but faith and
a burning love and a living hope to work miracles, and break the bars
of doom, and storm the kingdom.  [The ^viva speranza~ (l. 95), ^viva
speme~ (l. 109) of St. Gregory comes from 1 Pet. i. 3: `Benedictus Deus
et Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui secundum magnam misericordiam
suam regeneravit nos ^in spem vivam~ per resurrectionem Jesu Christi ex
mortuis.'  The `living hope' might avail to raise the dead by the force
of its prayers, -- to bring a soul even from Hell, `that its will might
have power to be moved' (l. 111).  Aquinas found great difficulty in
reconciling this story of Trajan with the orthodox doctrine that
prayers are of no avail for those in Hell because `they are beyond the
bond of charity (^extra vinculum charitatis~) by means of which the
works of the living are connected with the dead.'  Either Trajan was
not ^finally~ consigned to Hell, but punished only for what he deserved
at the moment, to be recalled to life for higher reasons and otherwise
disposed of; or Gregory's prayer only suspended his punishment till the
day of final judgment (^Summa~, Suppl. q. lxxi. a. 5).  Dante does not
accept either suggestion.  In ^Summa~, i-ii. q. cxiv. a. 6, Aquinas
asks whether one man can merit for another the first grace, as Gregory
seems to have done for Trajan; and answers that a man who is himself in
grace may win the first grace for another, not as a matter of merit,
but of friendship with God: `since a man in a state of grace fulfils
the will of God, it is fitting according to the analogy of friendship
(^secundum amicitiae proportionem~) that God should fulfil the will of
man in the salvation of another, although sometimes it may have an
impediment on the part of him whose justification the saint desires.']

	|118-129.~  The Eagle turns now to the case of Rhipeus, and traces
his salvation to the same unfathomable grace of God, working in
him the same supernatural virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love. 
Rhipeus, however, began with the natural virtue of justice:

     `All his love below he set on righteousness.'

Even this natural virtue, however, was possible to him only through
that grace whose `first wave' no created eye has ever seen: man's
natural powers, impaired by the Fall, are no longer of themselves able
to fulfil the virtues natural to them [^Summa~, i-ii. q. cix. a. 2]. 
Through this love of righteousness, itself inspired by grace, God led
this heathen soul on from `grace to grace' until He `opened

          His eye to our redemption yet to be.'

Accepting the coming salvation by faith, Rhipeus testified against `the
stench of Paganism' by which he was surrounded, and received the inward
baptism of the supernatural virtues without which the supernatural life
is impossible to man:

     `Those Ladies three, whom at the right-hand wheel
     Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism
     -- More than a thousand years before baptizing.'

The teaching of Aquinas is that baptism is absolutely necessary for
salvation, since only through it are we united with Christ [^Summa~,
iii. q. lxviii. 2.  In this Art. Aquinas teaches that baptism is
necessary to salvation -- meaning baptism of water; but that `when one
desires to be baptized, but is by some accident prevented by death,
before he receives baptism, he can gain salvation without actual
baptism, on account of the desire of baptism, which proceeds from faith
which worketh by love, through which God, whose power is not bound to
the visible sacraments, sanctifies man inwardly.'  Aquinas is speaking
of Christians, but the principle would cover the heathen world].  But
he distinguishes three baptisms -- of water, of blood and of desire. 
Either of the last two may stand for the baptism of water.  The baptism
of blood is martyrdom, fellowship in the passion of Christ.  The
baptism of desire is when the heart within is moved by the Holy Spirit
to faith and love and penitence; and by this the effect of baptism is
communicated to the soul apart from either water or blood [^Summa~,
iii. q. lxvi. a. 11.  The principle laid down in this Art. is that
baptism of water, having its efficacy from the passion of Christ, the
baptism of blood, being a direct participation in that passion, will
have the same efficacy; and since both these baptisms have their
efficacy from the Holy Spirit as first cause, the baptism of desire,
being the inspiration of the heart by the Spirit with faith, love, and
penitence, must have the effect of baptism in the ordinary sense]. 
This is obviously the baptism received by Rhipeus.  The Spirit of God
wrought within his heart the supernatural virtues of Faith, Hope, and
Love, and these formed the baptism of desire.  Dante indicates that the
ordinary place of these `three Ladies' is where he saw them in the
Earthly Paradise -- at the right wheel of the Chariot of the Church
[^Purg.~ xxix. 121-129].  But they are not bound to the Chariot. 
Divine grace is not the slave of the ordinary means by which it works.

	|130-132.~  The Eagle closes its disclosure with a warning to
mortals to refrain from passing judgment upon God.

     `O predestination, how far removed
     Thy root is from the vision of all those
     Who see not the First Cause in its entirety.'

That is, of course, from all created vision, for no creature can know
the entire being of God.  `We who see God,' says the Eagle, `know not
yet all the elect.'  [In ^Summa~, i. q. xxiii. a. 7, Aquinas says:
`Some say that out of mankind as many will be saved as angels fell;
some, as many as angels remained; some as many as angels fell, and over
and above, as many as the number of angels created.  But it is better
to say that "to God alone is known the number of the elect who are to
be set in supernal bliss" (as the ^Collecta pro vivis ac defunctis~ has
it).']  This deficiency of knowledge, far from troubling them, was a
joy: it refined their good with the still higher good of willing what
God willed, certain, even in their ignorance, that His will was right
and loving.  In this, Dante is thinking of the teaching of Aquinas on
Predestination.  Predestination is part of the universal providence of
God which orders everything to its proper end.  The end of the elect is
eternal life, which consists in the Divine vision; and since this is
an end beyond the power of human nature, it is necessary that God
should direct us to it, as an archer sends an arrow to the mark.  For
this, two things are needed -- grace in the present and glory in the
future; and of both Predestination is the cause.  The ^ratio~ or
ground of this Predestination is absolutely unknown to us: it must be
referred simply to the will of God, and God of necessity wills His own
goodness.  Hence Predestination is defined as `Divine Providence
leading rational creatures to their supernatural end, the Beatific
Vision,' the entire process, from beginning to end, having its reason
in the Divine will alone.  It is not dependent on the foreseen merits
of the elect; and the prayers of saints (such as Gregory's for Trajan)
are only part of the second causes by means of which the decree of
Predestination is worked out [^Summa~, i. q. xxiii. a. 1-8.  That `God
of necessity wills His own goodness,' is taught in q. xix. a. 3].

	|140-141.~  It is not easy to decide Dante's precise meaning when
he says that the Eagle's discourse was as `sweet medicine' `to make
clear his short sight.'  Taking the whole context into account, the
idea seems to be that the very mystery of Predestination gave room for
a larger hope of the salvation of the heathen.  The problem of Divine
justice, with which Dante's perplexity began, was absorbed and lost in
the mysterious movement of the Divine grace -- grace which loved to
suffer violence, and overflowed the bounds of Revelation and the
ordinary means of salvation.  This cleared the shortness of his sight,
and gave him a `living hope' that many more than Trajan and Rhipeus
might be rescued from the heathen world. 

	|146-148.~  And the same hope {that many more than Trajan and
Rhipeus might be saved}, apparently, filled these two spirits
themselves; for Dante says that, while the Eagle spoke,
Trajan and Rhipeus moved their flames like two eyes that wink together,
keeping time to its words and increasing his pleasure, as a good
harpist makes the strings quiver to the song of a good singer.  It is
the joy kindled by the hope that, in the Predestination of the
mysterious grace of God, many who, like themselves, had `sat in the
region and shadow of death' might yet stand `before the throne, and
before the Lamb,' among the `great multitude which no man can number of
all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues' [Rev. vii. 9.  The
idea that the quivering of their flames means their joy that the Divine
grace had saved themselves, seems to me to fall far short of the entire
spirit of the context.  The problem is the salvation or non-salvation
of the heathen, and the joy is that God's Predestination is so
unfathomable that no one knows the number of the elect (ll. 134, 135),
and that among them may be many from the world of Paganism of whose
salvation `the erring world' cannot conceive (ll. 67-69).  The marvel
is, as already said, that Dante used the hope so sparingly to satisfy
his long fast].
