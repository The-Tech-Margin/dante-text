	|Proemio.~  We have now emerged from the last shadow of earthly
stain or weakness into the cloudless light of God, and it may be well
to remind ourselves of the nature of the change which this
involves.  The souls in the three Heavens within the shadow failed
somewhat in the three theological virtues -- the inconstant
spirits of the Moon in Faith, the ambitious spirits of Mercury in
Hope, and spirits of Lovers in Venus in Love.  The souls in the
unclouded Heavens on which we now enter have these three virtues
in their fulness; and, in addition, each of the next four Heavens
is specially endowed with one of the four cardinal virtues -- the
theologians of the Sun with Prudence; the soldiers of Mars with
Fortitude; the righteous rulers of Jupiter with Justice; and the
contemplatives of Saturn with Temperance [see Introduction].

A brief outline of the four and a half Cantos which the
Heaven of the Sun occupies will help us to follow more
intelligently the long and difficult discussion of the symbolism
which lies before us.  After praising God for his arrival in the
Sun, which is His sensible image, Dante finds himself and
Beatrice surrounded by a circle of twelve spirits in the form of
starry lights of such brilliancy that they shine out clearly even
against the dazzling background of the Sun.  One of them, St.
Thomas Aquinas the Dominican, Dante's chief authority in moral
and theological questions, names his companions in his circle,
pronounces a great eulogy on St. Francis, and bewails the
degeneracy of his own Order.  On his resuming silence, a second
circle, also of twelve stars, appears outside the first, fitting
harmoniously into its dance and song; and the friend of Aquinas,
St. Bonaventura the Franciscan, acts as its spokesman,
pronouncing a eulogy on St. Dominic, naming the souls in his
circle, and lamenting the corruption of his own Order.  And
finally, after a discourse by Solomon on the Resurrection body,
far out beyond these two arises a third circle like a horizon
clearing up; `new subsistences' appear in it like stars scarce
seen in the first fall of evening; and then suddenly it flashes
out into such burning brightness that Dante's eyes are unable to
bear it, and he can only exclaim:

     O true sparkling of the Holy Spirit!

It may conduce to clearness if I state here at the
outset the interpretation of the three circles which I hope to
establish in the detailed exposition.  The fact that Aquinas is
the spokesman of the first circle implies that it represents, on
the whole, the Dominican type of theology -- the type which has
its chief source in the intellect, and of which St. Thomas
himself is the leading exponent.  Similarly, the choice of the
Franciscan St. Bonaventura as the mouthpiece of the second circle
means that it stands for the Franciscan type of theology -- a
type represented by Bonaventura himself, `the Seraphic Doctor',
with a much stronger infusion of mysticism, and greater reliance
on the instincts of the heart than on the arguments of the
intellect.  The two are not antagonistic: it is one of Dante's
chief aims to show that they are complementary and necessary to
each other.  Yet even the union of them is not the final type of
theology: there is a knowledge of God -- the `true sparkling of
the Holy Spirit' -- far out on the horizon of the future, wider
in its scope than anything Aquinas or Bonaventura had reached,
and too bright yet for mortal eyes.  I wish to connect this third
circle with the prophecies of the last soul named in the
Franciscan circle -- Joachim the Calabrian Abbot, whose doctrine
of the third era of the world, that of the Holy Spirit, was
creating in Dante's day such widespread division and persecution
in the Franciscan Order itself.  Dante, in short, wishes to
indicate the amount of truth he believed to be contained in this
Joachimite doctrine of the era of the Holy Ghost.  It is also
possible, though I cannot feel so sure, that the first two
circles correspond in some way to the eras of the Father and of
the Son.  As we shall see, these Cantos overflow with allusions
to the Trinity, and it is almost impossible to conceive of
Dante's setting three such circles in this Heaven of Theologians,
without intending them to correspond in some fashion to the three
Persons of the Godhead.

	|1-6.~  The Sun thus symbolizing God, it is the appropriate
`mansion' of Theologians; and the Trinity forming the great
subject of their study, these Cantos overflow with allusions to
this doctrine, some of which I may here point out and explain. 
The opening lines of Canto X. strike this Trinitarian keynote at
the very outset:

     Looking into His Son with the Love
     Which the one and the other breathe eternally,
     The Primal and unutterable Power
     Whate'er through mind or space doth circle
     With so great order made, that whoso sees it
     Cannot remain without some taste of Him.

This is the doctrine that Creation is the act of the whole Trinity. 
`To create,' says Aquinas, `pertains to God according
to His being, which is His essence, which is common to the three
Persons.  Hence creation is not proper to any one Person, but is
common to the entire Trinity....  God the Father wrought the
creature through His Word, which is His Son; and through His
Love, which is the Holy Spirit....  To the Father is attributed
and appropriated ^Power~, which is specially manifested in
creation, and therefore to be creator is attributed to the
Father.  To the Son is appropriated ^Wisdom~, through which every
one who acts by intellect operates; and therefore it is said of
the Son: ^All things were made by him~ (John i. 3).  To the Holy
Spirit is appropriated ^Goodness~ (^bonitas)~, to which belongs
government leading things to their proper ends, and the giving of life'
[^Summa~, i. q. xiv. a. 6].  We must also note the care with which
Dante states the doctrine of the Double Procession -- the going forth
of the Holy Spirit, not, as the Greeks held, from the Father alone, but
from both Father and Son.  It was the addition by the Latin Church of
the ^filioque~ clause to the Nicene Creed, which was one chief cause of
the Great Schism between East and West which became final in 1054.  The
Greeks held that to derive the Procession of the Spirit from both
Father and Son implied two Principles in the Godhead.  Aquinas replies
that the Spirit necessarily proceeds from the Son, else there would be
no real distinction of Person between them, and the Trinity would be
denied [^Summa~, i. q. xxxvi. a. 2].  Probably Dante had here a
special interest in asserting the orthodox doctrine, because the two
chief spokesmen of this Heaven were summoned to defend it against the
Greek deputies at the Council of Lyons in 1274.  Aquinas died on the
way, and Bonaventura during the sitting of the Council.  The two sides
agreed upon a form of words which united them for the moment: the Holy
Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, yet `not as from two
Principles, but as from one Principle; not by two Spirations, but by
one Spiration.'  The Prelates of East and West chanted the Nicene Creed
in their respective tongues, with the ^filioque~ added; but the
agreement was a purely verbal one, and the old Schism soon prevailed. 
It is, then, this mystery of the Trinity, thus fought over by the
Church on earth, which is now clearly revealed to this

                           fourth family
     Of the high Father, who forever sates it,
     Showing how he doth ^breathe,~ and how ^beget.~
     [^Par.~ x. 49-51.  See below, on xxxiii. 115-123.]

	|7-27.~  In connection with this doctrine of creation by the
Trinity, there is a passage about the motions of the Sun of great
difficulty.  It seems to be given as a supreme example of the ^order~
of creation.  Dante asks the reader to lift his eyes to `the high
wheels' at that point `where the one motion on the other strikes' --
that is the equinoctial point, where the ecliptic, `the oblique circle
which bears the planets,' crosses the circle of the Equator.  The
reference is to the annual revolution of the Sun.  Its ^daily~ motion
is from east to west, and parallel to the Equator; but its ^annual~
motion is from west to east, and along the Zodiac at a certain angle to
the Equator.  Dante now supposes two things.  (1) There might have been
no such angle -- the Zodiac, the pathway of the planets, might have run
parallel with the Equator, in which case,

     Much virtue in the heaven would be in vain,
     And almost every potency down here were dead.

Or (2) if the angle at which the Zodiac branches off from the
Equator were greater or less than it is, much would be wanting in
the order of the universe both above and below.  All this sounds
unintelligible to many readers, yet Dante's meaning is simple. 
It is contained in X. 32, 33, where he speaks of the Sun, `the
greatest minister of Nature,' as

              ^circling through the spirals~
     In which ever earlier he presents himself.

This is explained in ^Convito~ iii. 5.  Dante pictured the way in
which, from the Spring equinox onward, the sun rises earlier
morning by morning till it reaches its highest point and begins
to descend, as the spirals of the screw of a press.  Along these
spirals it rises north of the Equator ^earlier~ each morning for
ninety-one days and a little more.  Then the spiral movement is
reversed for the same length of time, the sun rising ^later~ each
morning.  The same then takes place on the south side of the
Equator.  Now, it is by this annual spiral movement of the sun,
caused by the obliquity of the ecliptic, that every part of the
earth, says Dante, receives in the full round of the year an
equal distribution of light and darkness.  If, for example, the
sun moved on a circle parallel with the Equator, and directly
above it, the equatorial regions would be scorched, the present
temperate zones would have no summer, and the Arctic regions
would lie in a perpetual winter.  If, on the other hand, the
obliquity of the ecliptic were either greater or less, there
would result some disturbance of the proper distribution of
sunlight, and therefore of the seasons on which human life
depends.  The probability is that Dante was thinking not of the
seasons alone, but of the entire influences which descend through
the planets, and in particular that distribution of Divine light
which is necessary for the salvation of the world.  Hence in this
passage he urges his reader to feed himself with this heavenly
food which he has set before him; and in the ^Convito~ he breaks
into praise of the Divine wisdom: `Wherefore it may be seen that,
by divine provision, the world is so ordained that when the
sphere of the sun has revolved and returned to any point, this
ball, on which we are placed, has received in its every region an
equal time of light and of darkness.  Oh, unutterable wisdom that
didst thus ordain, how poor is our mind to comprehend thee; and
ye for whose behoof and delight I am writing, in what blindness do ye
live, not lifting up your eyes to these things but keeping them fixed
upon the mire of your folly!' [^Conv.~ iii. 5 (Wicksteed's transl.). 
It is curious to compare this with Milton's view.  But for sin, the sun
had circled directly above the equator, and perpetual spring, equal in
day and night, had smiled upon the earth.  On the Fall, God gave the
Angels charge to alter the world to bring it into keeping with the
fallen state by extremes of heat and cold, storms and droughts, and
baleful influences of the planets.  This was accomplished by the
obliquity of the ecliptic, which was brought about in one of two ways
-- either the earth was pushed askew, or the sun's course was altered,
Milton cannot say which:

     `Some say he bid his Angels turn askance
     The poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
     From the Sun's axle; they with labour pushed 
     Oblique the centric Globe: some say the Sun
     Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
     Like distant breadth' (^Par. Lost.~, x. 649 ff.).

However grotesque this sounds, it is only an attempt to show that
Nature shared in the Fall of Man; and Dante has substantially the
same idea when he makes the storms and variations of weather cease
at St. Peter's Gate on Mount Purgatory, and perpetual Spring reign
in the Eden on the top (^Purg.~ xxi. 40-57).  To Dante, however, the
obliquity of the ecliptic was an original part of the order of the
universe, and a supreme proof of the Divine wisdom and goodness.]

	|34-42.~  We turn now to the detailed exposition.  Dante was no
more aware of his ascent to the Sun than a man is of his first
thought before it comes.  Beatrice, who represents Theology in its
widest sense, and the souls of Theologians, who constitute `the
fourth household of the High Father' {vv. 49-50}, shine so brightly
that he saw them, not by their colour, but by their light, light
visible even against the brilliance of the Sun.  The meaning is best
seen by contrasting this with the seven streamers which, in the
Earthly Paradise, flow from the Golden Candlestick back over the whole
Procession of the sacred writers: the light of Revelation broken up
into the seven colours of the rainbow [^Purg.~ xxix. 43-150].  Here in
the Celestial Paradise the broken hues of Revelation are blended back
into their original unity -- the white light of the Eternal Truth.  We
shall soon see that this unity of truth is one of the leading ideas of
this Heaven.

	|52-54.~  On his arrival, Beatrice calls on Dante to praise God
for his ascent to this nobler sphere:

                  `Give thanks, give thanks
    To the Sun of the Angels, who to this
    Sensible sun hath raised thee by His grace.'
    
`No object of sense in all the universe,' says Dante in the
^Convito~, `is more worthy to be made the symbol of God than the
Sun, which enlightens with the light of sense, itself first, and
then all the celestial and elemental bodies; and in like manner
God illuminates first Himself with intellectual light, and then the
celestial and other creatures capable of intellect' [^Conv.~ iii. 12]
-- that is, Angels and men. 

	|59-63.~  In other words, Dante knows that even yet he is only in
the `sensible sun' which is but a symbol of that Sun who is the light
of all Intelligences; and therefore that the theology which the Sun
represents is not the final vision, the direct immediate knowledge of
God.  Yet, though he is still in a world of symbols, his gratitude was
so filled with devotion and love to God, that for a moment he forgot
Beatrice herself.  Whereat she smiled: Theology, which she represents,
has fulfilled its chief end when it raises the soul beyond itself into
an ecstasy of love and praise.  Then `the splendour of her smiling
eyes' divided his mind, rapt into this unity of devotion, among the
many souls of this Heaven and the many forms of theological thought for
which they stand [^Par.~ x. 59-63].

	|70-93.~  Before entering on the narrative it may be well to
gather out some characteristics of the two Circles of Theologians,
which may help us to understand better their relations to one another.

(1) They are spoken of as garlands surrounding Beatrice. 
The inner one is called

            `this garland which encircles with delight
     The beauteous Lady who strengthens thee for heaven';

and when the second forms beyond it, Dante says

              Of those sempiternal roses
     The garlands twain encompassed us about.
                    [^Par.~ x. 91-93; xii. 19, 20.]

The meaning is obvious.  In the first place, theologians are
many, theology is one.  However these spirits may have differed
from one another in the great subject of their study here below,
in that heavenly world they are woven together into crowns for
Beatrice, the Divine Wisdom; and the crowns themselves as we shall see
immediately, are so vitally related that they are not two but one.  In
the second place, they are Dante's garland as well as his Lady's: the
theologians whom he sets in these two Circles are undoubtedly those
whom he wishes us to regard as his chief teachers and guides in
theology.  This is obvious in the case of the two spokesmen.  The
influence of Aquinas pervades the entire poem, and when Dante hears
Bonaventura's voice he turns to it as the needle to the pole [^Par.~
xii. 28-30].

(2) Their own proper shape is invisible; they appear in
the form of stars, the brightest in the sky [^Par.~ xiii. 1-24],
partly to indicate that all self is lost in the light of God, the joy
of knowledge glowing round them; and partly in fulfilment of the words
of Daniel (xii. 3): `They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.'  They are still `fires living and conquering'
[^Par.~ x. 64] -- conquering not merely our eyes, or the brightness of
the sun, as some think, but the darkness and evil of this lower world. 
As already pointed out, they have no colour, for colour is only a
fragment of light: the pure white light of Divine truth in its unity
shines through them.

(3) Their movements are also significant.  They dance and
sing, partly in joy of their vision of God, and partly in
yearning for a deeper vision: for we must never forget that
motion means the longing of the soul for its Highest Good.  The
subject of their song is the Trinity and the Incarnation, three
times repeated in the threefold circling of the dance:

     That One and Two and Three who ever liveth,
     And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,
     Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,
     Three several times was chanted by each one
     Among those spirits, with such melody
     That for all merit it were just reward.
                        [^Par.~ xiv. 28-33.]

And again:

     There did they sing, not Bacchus and not Paean,
     But in the divine nature Persons Three,
     And in one Person the divine and human --

for the Incarnation is the last and crowning mystery of theology
[^Par.~ xiii. 25-27.  The Incarnation is the last flash of the
Beatific Vision seen by Dante himself (xxxiii. 127-142)].

(4) Their knowledge of these high mysteries is progressive.  Dante
indicates this by comparing the garland of theologians to ladies who
pause in the dance waiting for the music of a new movement:

     Ladies to me they seemed, not from the dance released,
     But who do pause, in silence listening
     Until that they have gathered the new notes.

Casini says the simile is drawn from the pauses in the singing
and dancing of the ^ballata~ in Dante's day, especially in
Tuscany; and while indeed this adds vividness to the comparison,
it was not for mere vividness it was made.  The spiritual idea is
that in Paradise there is an endless growth in the knowledge of
God which is eternal life: joy in what is already known,
expressed in song; longing for fuller vision, symbolized in the
circling of the dance; and the silent pause of meditation
necessary for the new knowledge, represented by the ladies
waiting to catch `the new notes' of the next movement of the dance
[^Par.~ x. 79-81.  Of course, one is quite prepared to hear that this
interpretation is one of the over-subtleties of commentators; but if
the ^motion~ of these spirits means, as it certainly does, yearning for
fuller vision of God, it is reasonable to suppose that their ^pause~
has also its symbolic sense.  The truth is that commentators are not
subtle enough, or subtle in the wrong places; they often content
themselves with the mere surface and pictorial aspect of a simile
instead of penetrating to its symbolic core.  Critics should remember
that it is quite as bad an error of exegesis ^not~ to see a symbolic
meaning where the poet meant it, as to see one where he did not mean
it.  In the ^De Mon.~ (iii. 4) he says `there are two ways of going
wrong as to the mystic sense, either by looking for it where it is not,
or by taking it as it ought not to be taken.'  There is a third way --
never suspecting that it is there at all].

(5) But, as already hinted, Dante's chief interest
gathers round the unity of all types and shades of true theology
-- a unity which is a passion with him, and which he seeks to
bring out in a great variety of ways.  {See also comm. to ^Par.~ 11.37-
39, for the rest of Carroll's discussion of the contrasting relation
between Thomas and Francis.}

	|97-99.~  We turn now to the narrative.  St. Thomas Aquinas, when
his circle had ceased from the threefold song and dance with which it
welcomed Dante and his Guide, revealed the names of the twelve spirits
that composed it.  He begins reverently with his `brother and master,'
`Albert of Cologne,' known to us as Albertus Magnus -- `brother,'
because he belonged to the same Order, and `master,' because Aquinas
was his pupil.  The twenty-one folio volumes which he left on almost
every subject then known -- logic, metaphysics, psychology, natural
science, ethics, theology, chemistry, botany, and others -- justify his
title of `Universal Doctor.'  He was almost the first to Christianize
Aristotle [see note on Alexander of Hales {comm. to ^Par.~ 12.130-132}]
-- to apply his systematic methods to the construction of that vast
scientific organism of the Christian faith which his pupil, with
greater keeness and precision, wrought out in the ^Summa Theologiae.~ 
For this, the name of `the Ape of Aristotle' was flung at him in
contempt, and he was accused of allotting to a Pagan `the principal
seat in the middle of Christ's temple.'  In Dante's regard, Aquinas
triumphantly vindicated his master's work and method.  [Albert is the
true fountain-head of the ^Summa~, and therefore of the ethics and
theology of the greater part of the ^Commedia.~  His proper title to
fame, is, as Milman says, that, like the Franciscan Roger Bacon, he
applied himself to physical science and advocated experimental methods
of research.  `He was great,' says Archbishop Vaughan, `in natural
history; he was a botanist, a chemist, a geographer, an architect, a
geologist, and a mechanic, besides being an anatomist and an alchemist'
(^Life of St. Thomas of Aquin~ -- abridged, p. 92).  When in 1259 he
accepted the Bishopric of Ratisbon the General of his Order rated him
almost as if he were a renegade: `Who would believe that you, in the
very evening of life, would set such a blot on your own glory and on
that of the Order which you have done so much to augment?  Consider
what has befallen such as have suffered themselves to be drawn into
such offices: what their reputation now is, what fruits they have
brought forth, how they have ended their lives!' (Coulton's ^From St.
Francis to Dante~, p. 265).  In three years he resigned his see and
resumed his life as a friar.]

	|103-105.~  After modestly naming himself after his master -- `and
I Thomas of Aquino' -- Aquinas points out as the third in the circle
the spirit of Gratian, `the father of canon law,' as he has been
called.  `The rules enacted by the early church for its relations with
the secular power, its own internal administration, or the conduct of
its members, were called canons,' and were extended in after times to
include opinions of the Fathers and Decretals of the Popes.  Gratian, a
Benedictine monk of the Camaldolese Order, set himself about the middle
of the twelfth century to educe order out of the chaos of canons and
collections of canons which existed in his day.  Dante says that he
`gave such aid to the one and the other forum that he gives pleasure in
Paradise': in other words, that he brought into harmony civil and
ecclesistical law.  Probably the severe verdict of Gregorovius is much
nearer the truth: `This celebrated law book of the Middle Ages remains,
now that criticism has long exposed the fictions contained within it,
the legal colossus of barbarism and darkness, under whose spell mankind
lay for so many centuries.  It falsified the legal conceptions of
Church and State in order to secure the dominion of the world to the
Papacy' [^Rome in the Middle Ages~, iv. 643 (Engl. transl.).  Though
Dante thus sets Gratian in this Heaven, he none the less denounces the
way in which the study of the Decretals had displaced that of the
Gospels.  See above {comm. to ^Par.~ 9.127-138}].  To Dante, however,
it was an effort, pleasing to Heaven, to bring about that harmony
between the temporal and spiritual powers for which he himself wrought
and prayed.


	|106-108.~  The fourth light is Peter the Lombard, the famous
`Master of the Sentences,' as he was called from his ^Sententiarum
Libri Quatuor~, a collection of sentences from the writings of the
Fathers, with objections and replies, which became the great text-book
of theology in the Middle Ages.  The reference in x. 107, 108 is to the
Preface in which Peter says he desires to offer, as the poor widow did
her mite, to the treasury of the Lord.  Aquinas himself wrote a
commentary on the ^Sentences.~  Peter had been a pupil of Hugh of St.
Victor, one of the souls in the second circle, but he seems to have
absorbed none of his mysticism.  Milman well calls him the Euclid of
theology: within his short cold authoritative statements, logic and
reason could disport themselves without fear of transgressing the
limits of orthodoxy laid down by the Church.  [Peter was not the object
of universal admiration even in his own century.  `Walter of St.
Victor, a monastic Prior,' says Ueberweg, `gave, in about the year
1180, to Abelard, Petrus Lombardus, Gilbert and Peter of Poitiers, the
name of the "four labyrinths of France," affirming that all of them,
"inspired with the Aristotelian spirit, had treated with scolastic
levity of the ineffable Trinity and the Incarnation"' (^History of
Philosophy~, i. 400).]

	|109-114.~  It may be well to quote what is said of Solomon, the
fifth light, since a difficulty, which Aquinas afterwards solves,
arises from the last line:

     `The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,
     Breathes forth from such a love that all the world
     Down there is greedy to learn tidings of him:
     Within there is the lofty mind, where wisdom
     So profound was put, that, if the true is true,
     To see so much there never rose a second.'
                         
The eagerness of the world below to hear news of Solomon sprang
from the uncertainty of his salvation.  `The theologians of the
Greek Church, headed by Chrysostom,' says Plumptre, `were mostly
for a favourable judgment; Augustine and the Latin fathers for
an adverse.'  In Pietro Lorenzetti's `Last Judgment' in the
Campo Santo at Pisa, Solomon's final fate is left hanging in
suspense: he is just climbing out of a tomb in the centre of the
picture, and the only hint given is that his face is turned
towards Christ's right hand side.  In the great fresco of Aquinas
in the Chapter House of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, of all
the Scriptural writers ranged on each side of the Dominican, Solomon is
the only one who lacks the nimbus.  [In the fresco of Christ's Descent
into Hell in this Chapter House, our Lord is represented as rescuing
the Old Testament saints from Limbo, but among them there is no figure
that can be identified with Solomon.  On the other hand, in the
Byzantine mosaic of the same subject in the Cathedral of Torcello, two
figures at Christ's right seem to be David and Solomon.  This would
represent the more charitable judgment of the Greek Church].  Plumptre
thinks that for Dante the scale was turned in his favour by the
mystical interpretation of the ^Song of Songs~ in St. Bernard and Hugh
of St. Victor, to which the `love' of line 110 refers.  It was
certainly the contrast between this mystical love and sensual love
which created the uncertainty in men's minds.  In the apocryphal book
of ^Jesus the Son of Sirach~ (xlvii. 19, 20), a passage in praise of
Solomon's wisdom ends with the great blot upon his life: `Thou didst
stain thy honour, and pollute thy seed: so that thou broughtest wrath
upon thy children, and wast grieved for thy folly.'  In the
^Purgatorio~ (xxx. 10 ff.) Dante had already virtually decided
Solomon's salvation by setting him in the Procession of the Golden
Candlestick, and putting in his mouth the song of welcome to Beatrice:
^Veni sponsa de Libano.~

	|115-117.~  Of the sixth light, Dionysius the Areopagite, a
sufficient account has been given in the Introduction.  It is
difficult to understand the extraordinary fascination the writings
attributed to this `mythical hero of mysticism' had for the
Middle Ages.  `In one sense he may be called the father of
scholasticism from the influence he exercised on John of Damascus
in the Eastern, and on Aquinas in the Western, church.'  It has
been declared that `if the writings of Dionysius were to be lost, they
might be recovered piecemeal from the various works of St. Thomas'
[Smith and Wace's ^Dictionary of Christian Biography~, i. 847].  He
is the great authority, as Dante says, on `the Angelic nature and
ministry,' and we have seen that the entire structure of the ^Paradiso~
is based upon him.  Dante seems, however, to describe him as a little
light -- perhaps to indicate that even this knowledge of the Angels is
small compared with the knowledge of God, the proper subject of
theology.

	|118-120.~  There is some dispute as to the identity of the
seventh light, but the way in which it is described:

     `That advocate of the Christian times
     Of whose Latin Augustine availed himself,'

seems to prove that Paulus Orosius is meant.  In his ^Historiae
adversum Paganos~ the phrase here used, `Christiana tempora,'
occurs frequently.  `Paulus Orosius, a native of Tarragona in
Spain and a friend of Augustine, wrote his Seven Books of
"Histories" about the year 417, while he was still a young man
(`religiosus juvenis'), at the request of the Bishop of Hippo. 
They were to form a history of the world from the Deluge down to
his own time (the last entry relates to the year 417), and the
object of the book was to show that bloodshed, oppression, and
misery had ever been the staple of human history, and that "Christian
times" were unjustly blamed for the woes which the barbarians were then
inflicting on the empire' [Hodgkin, ^Italy and her Invaders~, i. 245. 
The History of Orosius, says Toynbee, `which attained a wide popularity
under the title ^Ormista~ (supposed to represend ^Or[osii] M[undi]
ist[ori]a~, was translated into Anglo-Saxon (in a free and abridged
version) by Alfred the Great.'  For Dante's obligation to the
^Ormista~, see Toynbee's ^Dante Studies and Researches~, 121-136]. 
The book was dedicated to St. Augustine, who used it in writing his ^De
Civitate Dei.~  Dante was also indebted to it for many of his
references to ancient history.  He calls Orosius a little light, to
distinguish him from the great schoolmen already named.

	|121-129.~  The eighth light has a greater number of lines devoted
to it than any other member of the circle.  It is Boethius, whose
^De Consolatione Philosophiae~ was one chief solace of Dante after the
death of Beatrice [^Conv.~ ii. 13; 16.  The `Consolation' was also
translated or paraphrased by King Alfred.  Of the four works on the
Trinity attributed to Boethius no trace is found till three centuries
after his death, and critics declare that the style is not his.  The
suggestion is made that a second Boethius, or more probably a second
Severinus, has been confused with the Roman senator (^Dicty. of
Christian Biog.~ i. 321)].  His full name seems to have been Anicius
Manlius Severinus Boethius (or Boetius).  Born about A.D. 470, he rose
to the highest honours under Theodoric, King of the Goths.  In 510 he
was Consul of Rome, and in 522 his two sons attained to the same
honour.  The very integrity of his character roused hatred in the Court
and wrought his ruin.  Under false accusations of treason, he was
thrown into prison in Pavia, and finally executed with barbarous
cruelty in 525.  It was during his imprisonment that he wrote his ^De
Consolatione~,

                `which the deceitful world
     Makes manifest to him who listeneth well' --

`a golden volume,' says Gibbon, `not unworthy of the leisure of
Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the barbarism
of the times and the situation of the author' [^Decline and Fall~,
chap. xxxix].  In the course of a few centuries, Boethius came to be
regarded as a martyr for the Christian faith -- in particular for the
orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, against the Arian heresy of
Theodoric, and he was canonized under the name of St. Severinus.  In
772 Luitprand, King of the Lombards, erected a tomb to his memory in
the church named in line 128, San Pietro in Cieldauro in Pavia.  Dante
seems to have connected Boethius in his thoughts with his own ancestor
Cacciaguida: in both cases he speaks of `the fallacious world' and of
their coming `from martydom unto this peace' [^Par.~ xv. 145-148].

	|130-132.~  The next three spirits are grouped together in a
^terzina~:

     `see further onward flame the burning breath
     Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard
     Who was in contemplation more than man.'

St. Isidore, Bishop of Seville in the beginning of the seventh
century, was the author of the ^Origines~, an encyclopaedia of
the learning of the time, and one of the most famous books of
study in the Middle Ages.  The names of Bede and Richard bring us
to our own land, the former being an Englishman and the latter a Scot. 
In his Epistle to the Italian Cardinals Dante reproaches them for their
neglect of Bede's works [Plumptre says `Bede, ^Eccl. Hist.~ v. 12,
supplies another vision of a brighter Purgatory even than Dante's: "A
vast and delightful field, full of fragrant flowers, in which were
innumerable assemblies of men in white."'  It must be remembered,
however, that this is only that part of Purgatorio, near the confines
of Paradise, assigned to those who died in good works.  For those who
delayed repentance till the end of life, a very different Purgatory is
allotted -- a great valley with flames on one side and hail and snow on
the other, and the deformed spirits tossed back and forward between the
burning heat and the piercing cold.  Dante has nothing so pitiless as
this in his Purgatorio]; and in the Epistle to Can Grande he defends
the mysticism of the ^Paradiso~ by referring his critics to the ^De
Contemplatione~ of Richard of St. Victor, the Augustinian monastery at
Paris.  Like Peter the Lombard, he was a pupil of Hugh of St. Victor,
whom he succeeded as Prior in 1162.  He distinguished six stages of
Contemplation, the highest transcending Imagination and Reason.  When
Dante says that Richard `was in contemplation ^more than man~,' he
means that he passed out of the limits of human nature.  There is in
the highest stage of Contemplation, Richard held, a dividing asunder of
soul and spirit.  `The spirit is joined to the Lord, and one with Him,
-- transcends itself and all the limitations of human thought.  In such
a moment it is conscious of no division, of no change; all contraries
are absorbed, the part does not appear less than the whole, nor is the
whole greater than a part; the universal is seen as particular, the
particular as universal; we forget both all that is without and all
that is within ourselves; all is one and one is all; and when the
rapture is past the spirit returns from its trance with a dim and dizzy
memory of unutterable glory' [Vaughan, ^Hours with the Mystics~, i.
163].  Richard is the most mystical spirit of this inner circle.

	|133-138.~  The twelfth light is that Siger of Brabant whom
Aquinas, as we saw, opposed in the earthly life, now his nearest
neighbour.  The Street of Straw in which Dante says Siger
lectured, is the ^Rue du Fouarre~ near the Place Maubert, itself
called after Albertus Magnus (^du Ma#itre Albert~), because for
want of room the Universal Doctor was forced to lecture in this
square.  The Rue du Fouarre is said to have got its name from the
bundles of straw which the students of those days used for seats;
and the mention of it is thought by some to be proof that Dante
himself had attended Siger's lectures.  It is impossible to say
what is meant by the `invidious truths' which Siger `syllogized';
or why in his grave thoughts he felt death's advent slow.  Probably a
somewhat melancholy man who longed for a world of light to solve the
weighty problems under which his mind laboured.

	|136.~  One interesting note of unity remains: the clearing
away in Paradise of the old theological rivalries and
misunderstandings of earth.  An example is given in each of the
two circles.  In the Dominican, the soul next to Aquinas on the
left is that of a certain Sigieri, believed to be Siger of
Brabant, a professor of Philosophy in the University of Paris in
the thirteenth century, with whom Thomas came into collision. 
`It appears,' says Toynbee, `that Siger took a prominent part in
the violent disputes which arose between the lay members of the
University of Paris and the friars of the mendicant orders
concerning the liberty of teaching; and that in 1266 he and
Guillaume de St. Amour were publicly refuted by St. Thomas
Aquinas, the champion of the Dominicans.'  He is said to have
been executed at the Papal Court at Orvieto in 1283 or 1284.  It is
this old opponent of Aquinas who is now his left hand neighbour in
Paradise [^Par.~ x. 133-138.  According to Ueberweg, however, Siger
`passed over from a type of doctrine akin to Scotism to Thomism'
(^History of Philosophy~, i. 457)].  That this is no mere accident is
proved by a precisely similar arrangement in the Franciscan circle. 
The spirit immediately on Bonaventura's left is `the Calabrian abbot
Joachim,' with whom personally indeed he had nothing to do since the
abbot was dead some twenty years before his birth.  But Bonaventura had
much to do, as we shall see, with Joachim's theology which, in the form
of prophecy, spread rapidly among the `Spiritual' Franciscans.  When
Bonaventura became General of the Order, he dealt severely with these
`Spirituals' or Joachimites as being virtually heretics; and now the
very man against whose theology he fought on earth shines at his side
in the same circle in Paradise.  Dante's meaning is clear: the man whom
on earth we regard as a heretic may be our nearest neighbour in the
world of light where we know as we are known [^Par.~ xii. 140.  It is
not meant that Joachim himself was regarded as a heretic, though he
narrowly escaped this fate through his eagerness to prove heresy
against another.  He charged Peter the Lombard (one of the souls in the
inner circle here) with holding a Quaternity in God, instead of the
Trinity he professed to teach.  The tract in which Joachim brought this
accusation was itself condemned by the great Lateran Council in 1215,
thirteen years after his death; and he himself escaped only because
shortly before his death he had professed himself a good Catholic and
submitted his writings to the judgment of Rome.  The relation of his
theology to the Franciscan Order is more fully discussed {below -- see
comm. to ^Par.~ 14.67-78}.  The reconciliation of opposing theologians
is parallel to that of kings in the valley of the Princes in ^Purg.~
vii, where Princes who on earth were sworn enemies are seen sitting
side by side, singing the same Christian hymn, and comforting one
another during their exile from the Fatherland].

	|139-148.~  It is at this point the comparison of this circle to a
horologe occurs.  As the parts of a clock `draw and thrust' each
other and thus sound forth the sweet matin chime, so these
various forms of theology act and react on each other, producing
by their very differences a heavenly harmony of movement and of
music; {in this} figure Dante beautifully suggests at once the unity
and the differences without which the unity could not exist.  He
compares the dance and song of the first circle to the movements and
music of a horologe, whose sweet chimes ring the faithful to matins:

     Then, like a horologe that calleth us
     What hour the Bride of God rises to sing
     Matins to her Spouse, that he may love her,
     Wherein one part the other draws and thrusts,
     '^Ting ting'~ forth sounding with so sweet a note
     That the well-disposed spirit swells with love:
     So did I see the glorious wheel revolve
     And render voice to voice in harmony
     And in sweetness which may not be known,
     Save there where joy doth make itself eternal.

[Plumptre thinks the comparison is drawn from `one of the mediaeval
clocks, of which the Cathedrals of Strasburg and Wells furnish
examples, and in which, as the clock struck the hours, figures came
forth and wheeled round and round, as in a dance'; but I am doubtful of
this.  For the difficulties of ascertaining the hours at night in
monasteries before the invention of clocks in the twelfth century, see
Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, 103.]  The significant
words are `one part the other ^draws and thrusts.~'  The harmony and
sweetness are produced by the very differences of the theologians
forming this circle, the attraction and repulsion of their various
views issuing in songs of praise for what each adds to each, and
setting them all in motion with longing for still greater knowledge. 
[The idea is repeated in ^Par.~ xiv. 19, where the souls are `^thrust
and drawn~ by greater gladness.'  We are reminded of Hegel's unity of
opposites, the reaching of truth through antagonisms.]
