	|1-12.~  Remembering this high honour done him by `the greatest
Peter' [^Inf.~ ii. 24], he resolves to accept the laurel crown nowhere
on earth save in his beautiful St. John, over the font by whose waters
he entered into the faith he has just confessed.  Canto XXV., as Vernon
says, `opens with lines of infinite pathos and beauty.  Dante, about to
be examined on Hope, breaks forth in the very centre of Heaven, into
the expression of what is his supreme hope and desire on earth, namely,
that his great poem may earn for him a recall from banishment'
[^Readings on the Paradiso~, ii. 244]:

     If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred
     To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,
     So that it many a year hath made me lean,
     O'ercome the cruelty that bars me out
     From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,
     An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,
     With other voice forthwith, with other fleece
     Poet will I return, and at my font
     Baptismal will I take the laurel crown,
     Because into the Faith that maketh known
     All souls to God there entered I, and then
     Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.

[The reference to heaven and earth in l. 2. probably means that
both supplied the material of the poem, and that the study of both
philosophy and theology, which had made him lean for many years,
entered into it.  The `other voice' of l. 7 probably refers to the
contrast between the poems of his early life and his `sacred poem' of
the Christian Faith.  The `other fleece' of the same line is an
allusion to his hair that had grown grey in exile, as is evident from
his own words in his First Eclogue to Giovanni del Virgilio.  This
Eclogue, indeed, seems to have been written at the very time when Dante
was beginning these ten closing Cantos of the ^Paradiso~, and the
correspondence between the two poets casts a most interesting light on
the present passage.  About the year 1319 Giovanni del Virgilio, a
professor of the humanities at Bologna, writes a pastoral song to Dante
at Ravenna, urging him to write in Latin for scholars, and to choose as
subject some of the stirring events happening in that day.  This, he
assures him, will bring him fame, and he, del Virgilio, will be
delighted to present him for the laurel crown to the applauding schools
of Bologna.  To this Dante replies in the same playful pastoral style,
gently declining to have his grey hairs crowned anywhere else than in
his native city: `Were it not better to trim my triumphal locks, and,
should I e'er return to my ancestral Arno, to hide there the grey
hairs, once yellow, under the twined leaves?'  He then declares his
purpose to accept the laurel only when the ^Paradiso~ is finished;
`When in my song shall be laid open the circumfluent bodies of the
world (the revolving spheres of Paradise) and the star-dwellers (saints
and Angels), even as are the nether realms, then shall it be my joy to
bind my head with ivy and with laurel.'  As yet ten Cantos of the
^Paradiso~ remain to be done (for there is no doubt that this is the
meaning of the pastoral allegory), so that it was just at this time
Dante was about to write these Cantos of Faith and Hope and the laurel
crown: `I have one ewe, the best-beloved (the ^Paradiso~), so full of
milk she scarce can bear her udders; under a huge rock (? the
protection of Dante's friend, Guido da Polenta of Ravenna) she chews
the fresh-cropped grass (Dante's latest studies for this part of the
poem); joined to no flock, accustomed to no fold (the poem had no
model); of her own will is she wont to come to the milking-pail, ne'er
driven by force (Dante waited for hours of inspiration).  Her I am
waiting to milk with ready hands; from her ten vessels will I fill to
send to Mopsus' -- the pastoral name of del Virgilio, that of Dante
being Tityrus.  There is little doubt that the `ten vessels' or
measures are these ten closing Cantos of the ^Paradiso.~  At the moment
Dante had not begun, apparently, the first of them, Canto xxiv., -- he
was waiting for the inspiration to flow; and the influence of this
correspondence with his friend concerning the laurel passed into all
the ten.  It is as if Dante were gathering up all his powers in one
final effort which would prove him worthy of the crown, if not on
earth, at least in Heaven.  Comp. Wicksteed and Gardner's ^Dante and
Giovanni del Virgilio~, 95-97; 119-125, etc.  Boccaccio (^Life of
Dante~, viii.) speaks of the poet's intense longing to receive the
laurel crown beside his baptismal font, -- perhaps only an echo of the
present passage.  See above {comms. to ^Par.~ 1.22-36; 37-48; 11.1-
12}.]  It is obviously an appeal, not merely against the cruelty which
prolonged his banishment, but also against some suspicion of heresy
that had gathered round his name: his soul by faith is known to God,
and in Heaven Peter has given him the crown refused on earth [cf. his
pathetic words in the Second Eclogue to del Virgilio (ll. 86, 87):

     `Hoc illustre caput, cui iam frondator in alta
     Virgine perpetuas festinat cernere frondes':

`This illustrious head for which already the Pruner hastens to choose
perpetual leaves from the exalted Virgin' (Daphne, the laurel)].

	|13-18.~  We come now to Dante's examination in Hope, the second
of the theological virtues.  As soon as his faith had received the
crown, out of the Apostolic sphere there flashed another light
which drew from Beatrice the joyful cry:

               `Look, look, behold the Baron,
     For whom, below there, is visited Galicia!'
   
The Baron is the Apostle James who, as we have seen, represents Hope;
and the title suggests one reason why.  According to the mediaeval
legends, St. James preached the Gospel in Spain.  After his martyrdom
by Herod Agrippa [Acts xii. 1, 2], his body was placed on a ship,
which was guided miraculously through the Pillars of Hercules to the
coast of Galicia in the north-west corner of Spain, the land he had
evangelized.  During the barbarian invasions his tomb was lost, and it
was only in the ninth century that it was discovered by a shepherd who
saw a miraculous light hovering over the spot.  From this the place may
have received the name of Compostella or ^Campus Stellae,~ `the Field
of the Star,' -- one of the most famous places of pilgrimage in the
Middle Ages.  [Another derivation suggested is ^Campus Apostoli.~  `One
of the most remarkable phases or developments of this legend of St.
James, is the ^rediscovery~ of the sacred body, which had been lost in
the sixteenth century, after, and in some way on account of, the
destruction of the Spanish Armanda by the English; and the promulgation
of the entire story as an Article of Faith by Pope Leo XIII.' (Ulick
R. Burke, ^History of Spain~, i. 156 n.).  In ^Vita Nuova~ {part.} 41 a
reference is made to pilgrims to the shrine at Compostella; and in
^Conv.~ ii. 15, the Milky Way or Galaxy (^Par.~ xiv. 99) is called
`^the Way of St. James~.']  St. James, or Santiago, became the patron
saint of Spain, and sometimes led its armies to victory in visible
form.  The proud Spanish noblemen, however, unable to bear having a
mere fisherman as their leader, transformed his father, Zebedee, into a
baron of Galilee, who fished indeed, but only for his own pleasure
[Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, i. 231].  It is possible
that Dante alludes to this legend, but the meaning certainly goes much
deeper.  The idea of a celestial Empire runs through the passage.  God,
or perhaps Christ, is the Emperor, seated in `the most secret hall' of
His heavenly palace, surrounded by His `princes,' `barons,' `counts,'
the leaders of His armies, who `jeoparded their lives unto the death in
the high places of the field' [^Par.~ xxv. 17; 23; 30; 41, 42].  This
idea of warfare comes out again and again.  James won the palm and
issued from the field in martyrdom [^Par.~ xxv. 82-84].  Dante is
called a son of the Church Militant, and his life a warfare [^Par.~
xxv. 52-57].  All this is intimately bound up with the very conception
of Hope as a theological virtue, an essential part of which is the
facing of arduous things.  According to Aquinas, the object of Hope
must have four marks: it must be good; must lie in the future; must be
arduous, difficult to reach; yet not unattainable: all of which are
found in `the hope of glory' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. xl. a. 1; ii-ii. q.
xvii. a. 1: `The object of hope is good in the future, arduous,
possible to be had'].  St. James, as the first martyr of the Apostolic
band, gave the supreme proof of the power of his hope to face arduous
things.  This seems to be the special reason why he is chosen as the
representative of Hope, which is a militant virtue nerving the soul for
the endurance of every suffering for the sake of eternal bliss.  His
very name, as we saw, was understood in this sense -- Jacob, the
`^supplanter~,' the man who, like Hope, had power to tread ^under~ foot
every toil, pain, and adversity [see above {comm to ^Par.~ 24.19-25}].

	|19-24.~  The meeting of the two Apostles is described in another
of those bird similes in which Dante delights:

     In the same way as when the dove alights
     Near his companion, and the one to the other
     Pours forth his love, circling round and murmuring,
     So did I see the one by the other great prince
     Of glory to be received with welcome,
     Praising the food whereon up there they feast.

[In a very ancient mosaic in S. Clemente in Rome, the Twelve Apostles
in the form of doves occupy the cross above and below the figure of
their crucified Lord.  The symbol was also applied to Christian
preachers, and in the mediaeval books which sprang from the
^Physiologus~, the meaning is pursued into great detail.  `As the dove
separates with its beak the choicest kernels of wheat from the chaff,
so it is the office of the preacher to separate the pure grain of
Christian doctrine form the husks of Judaism.  Its two wings are love
of man and love of God, compassion and contemplation, the active and
the meditative life; the ring round its neck is the encircling
sweetness of the Divine Word; the gold and silver of its plumage are
the precious treasures of purity and innocence, its whiteness
intermingled with changeable tints is the spirit of chastity in
conflict with fickle and rebellious passions; its red feet are the feet
of the Church stained with the blood of the martyrs; its two eyes
survey the past and discern the future, looking in upon the soul and up
to God; their yellowish lustre indicates maturity of thought and
reflection, for yellow is the colour of ripe fruit' (Evans' ^Animal
Symbolism in Eccles. Architecture~, p. 76).  See also `Dove (as
Symbol)' in ^Dict. of Christian Antiquities~, Smith and Cheetham.]  It
might be thought that the meaning of the dove, the emblem of the Spirit
that inspired the Apostles, could hardly be missed.  Yet one writer
sees nothing in the comparison but a delightful grotesqueness.  `It
might be possible to imagine two exquisites of the Court of Louis XIV.
strutting forward to meet each other, bowing their heads and preening
themselves, perhaps even wheeling round with courtly etiquette, but we
cannot conceive such a mode of greeting between two staid and dignified
apostles.  I think that Dante must have smiled as he wrote the words!'
[Christopher Hare's ^Dante the Wayfarer~, p. 149.]  It is possible, but
not at their grotesqueness.  Dante is simply bringing out by a simile
the harmony between the two virtues which the two Apostles represent,
faith being the substance of things hoped for.  Since hope seeks
happiness in God, its very existence depends on faith that God is; and
faith, in its turn, completes itself in hope.  It is this natural
friendship between the two virtues which Dante means to indicate by the
comparison of the doves.  It is `grotesque' only when this allegorical
element is ignored.  [There is no intention, of course, to exclude the
personal friendship which constitutes one of the joys of Paradise: that
is taken for granted.  Another meaning is perhaps not impossible.  The
Epistle of James, which Dante attributes to the Apostle James,
^appears~ to disparage faith (ii. 14-26): may not the affection here
between Peter and James indicate that there was no real disparagement? 
This, however, is a mere suggestion.]

	|25-31.~  When the friendly greeting was fulfilled, Beatrice asked
St. James to examine Dante on the virtue of Hope, addressing him as the
illustrious life by whom was written the liberality of the heavenly
palace.  The reference is to the Epistle of James, attributed here to
the Apostle: `If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
him....  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning' (i. 5, 17) -- the liberality of God being,
of course, a great quickener of hope. 

	|34-39.~  St. James bids Dante raise his head in the attitude of
hope and take assurance to himself; whereupon the poet tells us that,
in the words of Psalm cxxi., he `lifted up his eyes to the hills,' that
is, to the two Apostles, whose faith and hope towered so far above his
own, or rather, whose faith and hope were now lost in sight and
comprehension.  [St. Bernard in his Sermons on Cant. ii. 8 interprets
`mountains' as the higher orders of Angels, and `hills' as the lower
orders; or `mountains' as Angels generally, and `hills' as `Patriarchs
and Prophets and other spiritual men.'  Of the hills he gives a curious
alternative interpretation -- `the powers of the air,' fallen from
their mountain altitudes as Angels, but not humbled to the valley of
penitence: barren hills on which falls neither dew nor rain.]

	|40-47.~  St. James now proceeds to the examination, putting three
questions concerning Hope in one:

     `Say what it is, and how with it thy mind
     Enflowers itself, and say whence it came to thee.'

	|49-57.~  Before Dante can open his lips, the second of the three
questions is answered for him by Beatrice:

     `The Church Militant hath not any son
     With greater hope, even as is written
     In the Sun who irradiates all our band;
     Therefore to him is granted that from Egypt
     He come into Jerusalem to see,
     Or ever yet his warfare be accomplished.'

[The ^militar~ of the last line is an echo of the Vulgate of Job xiv.
14: `cunctis diebus, quibus nunc ^milito~, expecto donec veniat
immutatio mea' (R.V. `All the days of my warfare would I wait, till my
release should come').  Egypt, of course, is the bondage of this
present world, Jerusalem the liberty of the Glory of Heaven (Heb. xii.
22).  Comp. ^Purg.~ ii.  46, where the souls chant Ps. cxiv. 1, `In
exitu Israel de Aegypto'; ^Conv.~ ii. 1; and ^Epis.~ x. 7, where the
anagogical sense of the Psalm is given as `the departure of the holy
soul from the bondage of this corruption to the liberty of the eternal
glory.']  In other words, so strong is Dante's hope of glory that it is
changed to sight of the glory itself, while he is still in the flesh. 

	|58-63.~  It is not easy to understand why Beatrice gives this
answer instead of Dante.  The usual solution is that had Dante said
this of himself, it would have been a piece of self-praise; and, of
course, this must be part of the meaning, since Beatrice expressly says
she leaves him to answer the other two questions because this will
involve no boastfulness [for the folly of self-praise and self-blame on
a man's own lips, see ^Conv.~ i. 2].  It is difficult, however, to see
why it should be boastful for Dante himself to say he had hope, when he
has no hesitation in saying he had faith and love.  Indeed, in a few
lines further on he does say that he is full of hope to overflowing
[^Par.~ xxv. 77.  For Dante's claim to have faith and love, see xxiv.
85-87 and xxvi. 16-18].  One cannot help suspecting the true reason
lies in the attitude which Beatrice took up to him in the Earthly
Paradise on this very matter of hope.  There she drove Dante's sin
against herself home to his conscience so relentlessly that the Angels,
in pity of his pain, began to sing the opening verses of Psalm xxxi.:
'^In te, Domine, speravi~'; `In thee, O Lord, have I put my hope.' 
Beatrice, however, firmly sets aside their interference, and refuses
Dante the consolation of hope until he has drunk to the dregs the full
cup of sorrow for his sins [^Purg.~ xxx. 55-145.  See my ^Prisoners of
Hope~ {comm. to ^Purg.~ 30.76-108}].  It is difficult to think that the
two passages are unconnected, especially in view of the ^Sperent in te~
of line 98 of this Canto.  Dante wishes to tell us that she who once so
sternly refused him the comfort of hope now stands sponsor for him in
Heaven for this very virtue.  Indeed, it is to her he traces his
possession of it.  She is `the compassionate one who guided the
feathers of his wings to so lofty a flight' [^Par.~ xxv. 49-50].  At
the very moment when she was most stern to him, her green mantle, her
olive wreath, her emerald eyes, all spoke of hope [^Purg.~ xxx. 31, 32;
xxxi. 116]; and his last grateful words to her are:

     `O Lady, in whom my hope hath vigour.'
                    [^Par.~ xxxi. 79.]

	|64-69.~  With the eagerness of an expert scholar, Dante proceeds
to answer the master's questions:

     `Hope,' said I, `is a certain expectation
     Of future glory, which is the product
     Of grace divine and merit precedent' --

a definition taken almost word for word from Peter Lombard [Peter
Lombard's words are (^Sentences~, iii. Dist. 26): `Est enim spes certa
expectatio futurae beatitudinis, veniens ex Dei gratia et meritis
praecedentibus, vel ipsam spem, quam natura praeit charitas,
vel rem speratam, id est, beatitudinem aeternam.  Sine meritis enim
aliquid sperare, non spes, sed praesumptio dici potest'].  As we have
seen so many times, Hope as a theological virtue has the vision and
enjoyment of God as its final end.  As a habit of the soul, its origin
is the grace of God.  When, for instance, Dante says it is the product
in part of `precedent merit,' he does not mean that we can first do
some meritorious act, and thus earn the virtue of hope.  Hope is a
virtue `infused' by the Divine grace, and grace is not a matter of
merit.  The true connection is this.  First, Divine grace creates
within the soul the virtue of hope -- a supernatural virtue aiming at a
supernatural end.  This virtue urges us to acts in keeping with it, and
these acts being done in grace are accepted as meritorious by God.  [It
is to be remembered that, according to the doctrine of the Roman
Catholic Church, the foundation of merit is grace.  Only works done in
grace merit eternal life; and they merit this only because God has
graciously promised to reward such works in this way.  Hence men in a
state of grace can claim this reward according to ^justice~, since it
is a promise of God.  Since everything thus runs back to grace, it
becomes a question whether `merit' retains almost anything of its
proper meaning.  Practically, merit is simply acting according to the
grace of God and His promises, which are also of grace.]  Then the
grace and the merit flowing from it create within the soul `a sure
expectation of future glory' -- the `precedent' having reference,
according to Aquinas, not to the grace but to the glory [^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. xvii. a. 1 ad 2.]; and the ^certitude~ of the expectation has
its root in that knowledge of God which faith gives, for `hope rests
principally on the Divine omnipotence and mercy, of which every one is
certain who has faith' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xviii. a. 4.  Bonaventura's
description of Hope is: `Spes est audacia mentis de largitate Dei
concepta habendi vitam aeternam per bona merita.'  The certitude of
Hope, he says, springs from three things -- the divine liberality,
abundance of merits, and the foretaste of things eternal.  He
distinguishes between various degrees of certitude.  The hope of souls
in this world has certitude of ^opinion~, that is, it holds to its
object, but with a certain fear of not reaching it.  That of souls in
Purgatory has certitude of ^knowledge~ (scientia).  And Stephen when he
saw the heavens opened, Paul when he said, `I know whom I have
believed,' and Adam before his sin, had certitude of ^vision~, though
much weaker than in heaven (^Compend. Theolog. Veritatis~, v.  22)].

	|70-75.~  Hope being thus defined, Dante proceeds to answer the
Apostle's third question -- from whence it came to him.  `From
many stars,' he says, the stars being the souls in this Heaven of
stars whose light had been to him the prophecy of the eternal
day.  The first of these stars of hope is David, `the supreme
singer of the supreme Leader' -- first, because he directs the
soul to Him who is the beginning and end of all hope:

     `^Let them hope in thee~, in his Theody
     Saith he, ^those who know thy name:~ and who
     Doth not know it, if he hath my faith?'

[The Psalm quoted is ix. 10: `Et sperent in te qui noverunt nomen
tuum.']   Since hope has for its object God Himself, and since without
His help we cannot reach Him, it is obvious that we must know His name
so far as to believe in His existence and His willingness to grant us
the necessary aid: `he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and
that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.'  Faith in the
goodness of God, therefore, is the root of hope [Heb. xi. 6; ^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. xvii. 7: Faith precedes hope, because it makes known to us
the possibility of reaching eternal life, and that divine help will be
given us to reach it.  In the dance of the three theological virtues in
the Earthly Paradise (^Purg.~ xxix. 127-129), sometimes Faith led and
sometimes Love, but never Hope]. 

	|76-78.~  And this is probably the reason why James himself is
named as the second source of Dante's hope, or rather as instilling it
into him with David's instilling -- that is, presenting God as the
fountain of hope.  The reference seems to be to that liberality of God
in the first Chapter of the Epistle of James already spoken of.

	|79-84.~  On hearing Dante's words the burning heart of the
Apostle quivered with a sudden flash as of lightning.  It is not the 
fire of hope, since the hope of the Blessed is now fulfilled, but the
dear memory of the virtue which followed him

     `Even to the palm and the issuing from the field.'

[On the question whether the Blessed have hope, see {comm. to vv. 85-
96}.] 


	|85-96.~  He then asks one final question -- what does hope
promise?  The reply is a curious example of mediaeval interpretation of
Scripture:

     `Of the souls that God hath made His friends
     Isaiah saith that each one shall be clothed
     In his own land with double garments,
     And his own land is this sweet life.'

[The reference in l. 90 is to James ii. 23: `And he was called the
friend of God.']  Isaiah in the passage referred to (lxi. 7) says
nothing about garments: `In their land they shall possess the double,'
though in v.10 he speaks of `the garments of salvation' and `the robe
of righteousness.'  The promise, says Dante, is worked out with greater
fulness by James's brother in the passages in the Apocalypse (vi. 11;
9-17) where he speaks of `the white robes.'  The double garments are
the reunion of body and soul in the Resurrection.  The interpretation
runs back to St. Gregory the Great.  In his ^Dialogues~ (iv. 25),
speaking of this reunion he says: `In respect of this their double
glory, the Scripture saith: "In their land they shall possess double
things"; and it is written of the souls of the just, that before the
day of resurrection, "to every one of them white robes were given: and
it was said to them, that they should rest yet a little time, until the
number of their fellow-servants and brethren were complete."  They,
therefore, that now receive but one robe, in the Day of Judgment shall
every one have two: because now they rejoice only for the felicity of
their souls, but then shall they enjoy the endless glory of body and
soul together.'  [According to the Church's teaching, the Blessed can
have no hope, since they now possess the thing hoped for.  Hence James
says hope followed him `to the palm and issuing from the field' (ll.
82-84), that is to his martyrdom, and no farther.  It might be thought,
however, that since the Blessed are still waiting for `the redemption
of the body' in the Resurrection, they would still be subject to the
hope of that redemption.  This, however, Aquinas denies for three
reasons: (1) the principal object of hope is glory of the soul, not of
the body; (2) the glory of the body, though `arduous' to human nature,
is no longer arduous to one who has already the glory fo the soul; (3)
he who has the glory of the soul has therewith that which is sufficient
to produce the glory of the body (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. 18, a. 2).  In
spite of such arguments, the eager cry of ^Amen~ to Solomon's words
about the Resurrection body (^Par.~ xiv. 61-66) shows that the souls
`desire' their bodies, and therefore must have hope for them in some
sense.  Aquinas is bound by his own definition that the object of hope
must be `arduous' to reach; but it is surely possible to hope for
things easy to reach.]

	|97-99.~  This is the close of the examination in Hope.  Scarcely
had Dante spoken of `the white robes,' when he heard chanted the words
he himself had just quoted from the Psalms: `^Sperent in te~.'  It is
generally assumed that the singers were one of the groups of souls in
this Heaven, perhaps the choir of the Apostles.  But Dante expressly
says the sound came `from above,' and that it was responded to by
`^all~ the carols.'  `From above,' therefore, seems to refer to the
Angels in the next Heaven, the choirs of Angels above, and the choirs
of saints below, singing the Psalm antiphonally.  It is probably meant
to be the reversal of the incident in the Earthly Paradise referred to
a little ago.  There, when the Angels, pitying Dante's distress, sang
'^In te, Domine, speravi~,' they were promptly silenced by Beatrice --
he had then no title to hope.  Now everything is changed.  Beatrice
herself proclaims him a child of hope.  Dante passes his celestial
examination in the virtue.  And choirs of saints and Angels greet him
as one whose hope in God proves him worthy to inherit the promises.

	|100-114.~  When the Psalm of Hope was ended, from the midst of
the carols there beamed forth a light as bright as the sun.  [This is
the meaning of xxv. 100-102.  During the winter month from middle of
December to middle of January, while the sun is in Capricorn, the sign
of Cancer opposite is in the sky at night.  If during that time Cancer
had a light as bright as St. John, winter would have a month of
daylight -- the sun shining by day and this `crystal' of Cancer by
night.]  It is the spirit of St. John, the representative of Love among
the Apostles, as Beatrice tells Dante:

     `This is he who lay upon the breast
     Of our Pelican, and this he who was
     From upon the cross to the great office chosen.

The words are meant to indicate the two great reasons why John is the
symbol of Love.  In the first place, he lay upon the breast of Love
Himself.  Christ is called `our Pelican' because He shed His blood for
our salvation.  The red spot on the bill of this bird gave rise to the
idea that, when it was pruning its feathers, it was thrusting its bill
into its breast and feeding its young with its own blood.  It became,
therefore, one of the most familiar symbols of the love of Christ in
laying down His life for sinners; and John, who lay on the breast of
our Pelican, came nearest to that heart of Love which poured out its
life-blood for the world [John xiii. 23.  There are many forms of the
Pelican myth.  One is that the young pelicans rebel against their
father, and that he in self-defence strikes and kills them.  Then in
pity he strikes his bill into his breast, sprinkles his blood on them,
and thus recalls them to life.  Similarly, man rebels against his
Creator, is doomed to death, and is revived by the blood of Christ. 
For this reason the pelican was often painted above the head of Christ
on the cross, as in the Spanish Chapel and in the Chapter House of St.
Mark's in Florence.  It was also used as a lectern for the Gospels. 
The references in literature are numerous.  In ^Hamlet~ (Act iv. Sc.
5) Laertes, speaking of his dead father, says:

     `To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
     And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
     Repast them with my blood.'

In Tennyson's ^Holy Grail~ Sir Bors has a pelican for the crest of his
helmet as he rides in quest of the cup that held his Redeemer's blood,
the idea being taken from Malory's Morte D'Arthur (Bk. XVI. chaps.
vi., xiii.): `He (Sir Bors) looked up into a tree, and there he saw a
passing great bird upon an old tree, and it was passing dry, without
leaves; and the bird sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for
hunger.  So smote he himself with his beak, the which was great and
sharp.  And so the great bird bled till that he died among his birds. 
And the young birds took the life by the blood of the great bird.'  An
Abbot afterwards showed him how this was a figure of the shedding of
Christ's blood for sinners.  St. Augustine in his commentary on Ps.
cii. 5 refers to the myth.  For other references, see Hulme's
^Symbolism in Christian Art~, 188, 189, and Longfellow's note on the
passage.  In a hymn by Aquinas occurs the following verse:

     Pie Pelicane, Jesu Domine,
     Me immundum munda Tuo sanguine,
     Cuius una stilla salvum facere
     Totum mundum quit ab omni scelere.

Two examples of the political use of the pelican myth may be given.  In
a book written after the execution of Charles I. in 1649, the martyred
king, as the writer believed him to be, is called `the Princely
Pelican.'  In the following year the first Marquis of Montrose took up
arms in Scotland to avenge his death, but being captured and executed
in Edinburgh, the same name was applied to him.  A medal was struck
with his portrait on one side, and on the other the legend:

     `Treu Pellican who spilt his blood
     To save his King, do's Country good'].

In the second place, Jesus from the very cross chose this
Apostle for `the great office' of taking His own place as a son to His
Mother.  When we remember the almost boundless reverence which the
Church pays to the Virgin, we can understand what Dante thought of the
man worthy of so Divine a trust.  Christ gave His Mother into the
charge of the disciple nearest to Himself in love [John xix. 25-27. 
Vellutello in his commentary says of this passage: `This is he of whom
the Church sings the antiphon: Iste est Johannes Evangelista, qui in
coena Domini supra pectus Jesi Christi recubuit, cui Christus, in cruce
pendens, matrem suam virginem virgini commendavit'].

The burning soul of St. John drew near the other two Apostles who
were circling round under the impulse of their glowing love, and put
himself into the song and dance.  His manner of doing this is compared
to that of `a joyous virgin' who rises to join the dance, `to do honour
to the bride, and not for any failing', that is, not through any
imperfect motive.  The comparison is drawn from the virgin purity of
the Apostle.  The bride is generally taken to be Beatrice, who, in xxv.
110, 111, is said to have held her eyes like a bride fixed on the
threefold light.  If so, she represents the ideal Church, in contrast
to the Papacy which St. Peter is soon to denounce.  But there can be
little doubt that Dante is thinking of the many references in the
Apocalypse to the Church as `the bride, the Lamb's wife.'  The love
which John represents signifies the eternal marriage, the final and
absolute union, of the soul with God for Himself alone.  And just here,
perhaps, we may find the meaning of the clause in line 105 -- `and not
for any failing.'  For, according to Aquinas, even faith and hope cling
to God for the sake of something to be gained from Him, namely, truth
and happiness; whereas love has no end save God Himself.  Hence it is
`for the honour of the bride' that love should infuse itself into faith
and hope, that all three virtues should have but one end -- the
Bridegroom Himself [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xvii. a. 6].

	|118-121.~  Dante, on being told who this third `splendour' was,
did an unwise thing, for which he had to suffer: he strained his eyes
so eagerly at the burning orb of the Apostle's soul that he was
blinded, like a man who gazes at the sun's eclipse.  To his alarm, he
finds himself unable to see Beatrice:

     Ah, how much in my mind was I distressed,
     When I turned me round to look on Beatrice,
     That her I could not see, although I was
     Close at her side, and in the happy world!
                    [^Par.~ xxv. 136-139.]

I am unable to accept any of the allegorical interpretations of this
blindness known to me.  `Benvenuto thinks', says Mr. Gardner, `that
there is no meaning intended beyond the literal one, but mentions that
many strive to expound the passage allegorically, as that the poet was
troubled by some doubt, or that, in endeavouring to penetrate more
deeply into the mysterious revelations of this Eagle of Christ, his
intellectual sight was dazzled, and it needed the teaching of theology
to restore him from the blindness or error.  Others suppose that he
cannot see Beatrice because the glorious depths of Charity surpass and
eclipse the teachings of Theology; or that the meaning is that the
grace of God sometimes deprives man for a time of spiritual sight, to
then give it him again in fuller measure (Scartazzini).  It may perhaps
be intended as a warning against independent and unauthorized
interpretation of the Apocalypse, with a possible reference to some of
the errors of the later followers of Joachim; but if, as is more
probable, it is an allegory of a period of gloom and want of spiritual
consolation, there would be a most beautiful fitness in the utter
trustfulness of Dante's discourse on the Divine Love as long as the
blindness lasts' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 182].  Some of the
suggestions here are very interesting, but they all suffer from one
serious fault -- they ignore Dante's own words.  The true cause of his
temporary blindness was that he did ^not~ gaze at `the glorious depths
of Charity' in the Apostle of Love; probably, had he had the soul to do
this, he would have retained his sight and made it clearer.  But at the
very moment when there appears before him the crowning virtue by which
the soul becomes one with God, what is Dante thinking of?  Of an old
legend of foolish earth below, which had gathered round the body of St.
John.  He is consumed with curiosity to see if the story is true, and
that poor curiosity blinds him to higher things.  The very form of the
story as given in the ^Golden Legend~ reminds us of the passage before
us.  John, at the age of ninety-nine, having received a message from
Christ that he was to be with Him the following Sunday, after service
on that day bade the people dig a sepulchre in front of the alter. 
Descending into it he prayed, and `anon came upon him great clearness
and light, and so great brightness that none might see him, and when
this light and brightness was gone and departed, there was nothing
found in the pit or grave but manna, which came springing from under
upward, like as sand in a fountain or springing well.' 

	|122-129.~  To use Dante's own comparison, he was not looking at
the sun for the sake of its light, but in order to see the darkness of
the eclipse.  Hence John's rebuke:

               `Why dost thou dazzle thee
     To see a thing which hath here no place?
     Earth in earth my body is, and there shall be,
     Together with the rest, until our number
     With the eternal purpose is made equal.
     With the two garments in the blessed cloister
     Are the two lights alone that have ascended;
     And this thou shalt bear back into your world'.

[John probably refers to his own words in Rev. vi. 11: `And white robes
were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they
should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servants also
and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be
fulfilled.']  In this rejection of the legend Dante differs from
Aquinas, who held as a `pious belief' that both Mary and John received
the resurrection of the body immediately after death, not of merit, but
of special privilege [^Summa~, Suppl. q. lxxvii. a. 1, ad 2.  John
himself was regarded as the authority for the Assumption of the Virgin. 
The story is that St. Thomas was the only Apostle absent when she died. 
On his arrival, the tomb, being opened to show him the holy dust, was
found empty; whereupon a revelation was given to St. John that Christ
had taken His Mother's body, now united with her soul, to be with Him
in Heaven].  This John himself denies.  Christ and His Mother, the two
lights that had ascended from this Heaven, are the only ones clothed in
the double garment of soul and body.  Even Enoch and Elijah are
excluded from this blessedness.  [Wicksteed and Oelsner's note may be
quoted: `According to the conception prevalent in the Middle Ages,
Enoch and Elijah, who were also taken up bodily from the earth, were
not in heaven, but in the Earthly Paradise.  Perhaps the present
passage may be taken as indirect evidence that Dante too accepted the
tradition' (^The Paradiso~, Temple Classics, 313).  They were
identified with the two witnesses of Rev. xi. 3. ff.  `Enoch no doubt
was translated, and so was Elijah; nor did they experience death: it
was postponed most certainly: they are reserved for the suffering of
death, that by their blood they may extinguish Antichrist' (Tertullian,
^De Anima~, 50).  This is probably the reason why they are omitted
here: their death is only postponed.]
