	|1-3.~  After pointing out the soul of Romeo, Justinian sang a
hymn of praise to God, and, `revolving to his own note,' passed
with his companions suddenly out of sight, `like swiftest
sparks.'  The hymn is a curious mingling of Latin, the language
of the Christian Church, and Hebrew, that of the Jewish:

     `Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,
     Superillustrans claritate tua
     Felices ignes horum malachoth!'

[`Hosannah! holy God of Hosts, illuming by thy brightness from above
the happy fires of these kingdoms.'  The note in Toynbee's ^Dante
Dictionary~ (s.v. `Deus') is: Dante introduces three Hebrew words here,
two of which occur in the Vulgate (`Hosanna,' ^Matt.~ xxi. 9, 15;
^Mark~ xi. 9, 10; ^John~ xii. 13; `Sabaoth,' ^James~ v. 4); the third,
`malachoth,' which is a misreading (found apparently in all the MSS. of
the Vulgate) for `mamlachot,' occurs in the Preface to the Vulgate by
St. Jerome, known as `Hieronymi Prologus Galeatus.']  It is natural for
the great Emperor who had been the master of armies to address the
Highest as `the God of Hosts'; and the reference to His illumination of
the spirits in all the realms of Paradise in his confession that there
is no glory but that which makes blessed with His light.  Justinian has
risen for ever above the desire to shine by his own glory.

	|10-66.~  We come now to the chief theological discourse in the
^Paradiso~, its subject being the Atonement, on which all human
salvation hangs.  It arises from the passage in Justinian's
review which relates to the three Roman Emperors -- Augustus,
Tiberius, Titus -- whom Dante connects in a peculiar way with the
birth and crucifixion of Christ.  The general idea is that
through these three `the Living Justice' wrought `vengeance on
the ancient sin' -- the original sin of the race, and then vengeance on
that vengeance; and Beatrice [Dante hesitates to ask Beatrice for this
explanation.  His reverence for even a fragment of her name ^Be~ or
^Ice~ -- its beginning or ending -- hinders him.  Some think the
reference is to the familiar name `Bice' which he uses in ^Vita Nuova~
{Sect.} 24, and Sonnet xxxii., but the connection here makes this
familiarity very improbable] explains this marvellous paradox of
justice.  To understand her exposition, it is necessary to have clearly
in mind Dante's view of these three Emperors as set forth in the ^De
Monarchia.~  {For full discussion see comms. to ^Par.~ 6.80-81; 82-90;
92-93.}

	|67-120.~  Beatrice begins her discourse by declaring that the
condition of understanding the mystery is Love, and Love in its
maturity.  For this reason, it is much discussed, but little
discerned.  The necessity for Love in those who would understand
it, rises from the fact that the choice of this mode of salvation
before all others springs from the pure love of God.  The Divine
goodness, spurning all envy, sends out from its own inner light
such sparkles of its glory as best display `the eternal
beauties.'  This out-sparkling of Himself begins in creation, in
which, as Aquinas says, `God willed to communicate to creatures, as
much as possible, the perfection of His Goodness' [comp. ^Timaeus~, 29:
`Let me tell you why the creator created and made the universe.  He was
good, and no goodness can ever have any jealousy of anything.  And
being free from jealousy, he desired that all things should be as like
himself as possible....  God desired that all things should be good and
nothing bad in so far as this could be accomplished' (Jowett's
transl.).  In ^Summa~, iii. q. i. a. 1, Aquinas argues the fitness of
the Incarnation from the very nature of the Divine goodness.  It
pertains to the conception of goodness that it communicates itself to
others; and therefore to the conception of the Highest Goodness that it
communicates itself in the highest mode, and the highest mode is the
Incarnation in which the Divine and human are united].  Now, the
greatest communication of this goodness takes place in the case of
those beings which are created by the immediate hand of God, and
without the intervention of second causes.  Such is man who, as the
direct creation of God, received from the Divine goodness three great
gifts of likeness to Itself -- first, the seal of immortality; second,
freedom from subjection to second causes, or, as Beatrice calls them,
`the new things,' because of their later creation; and third, the image
of the Divine Love, which shines most in that which most resembles it. 
These three constitute the nobility of man in his original state as he
left the hand of God, and if any one of them fails the nobility is
lost.  The failure took place in the free-will, which by sin lost much
of its original freedom:

     `'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,
      And render him unlike the Good Supreme,
      So that he little with its light is brightened.'
                              [^Par.~ vii. 79-81.]

Human nature, thus sinning as a whole `in its seed,' the First Parent
[^Par.~ vii. 85-87.  The fall of human nature ^as a whole~ `in its
seed' constitutes another impossibility in the redemption of man by
himself.  `No mere man was able to satisfy for the sin of all mankind,
since every mere man is something less than the whole multitude of
mankind.  For the deliverance then of mankind from their common sin, it
was requisite for one to make satisfaction, who was at once man, so
that satisfaction should be expected of him, and something above man,
so that his merit should be sufficient to satisfy for the sin of the
whole human race' (^Contra Gentiles~, iv. 54, Rickaby's transl.). 
Dante's idea throughout the present passage is that Christ assumed
human nature in its entirety, and therefore was able to satisfy for the
whole race], lost Paradise, and can recover its original dignities in
one way alone, by filling up the void which sin has made in the justice
of the universe, by means of a just penalty equivalent to the evil
delight.  The only possible alternative to this would be that God, `of
His sole courtesy,' should grant a free pardon.  Anselm, in his ^Cur
Deus Homo?~ from which much of the argument here seems to be taken,
argues that to pass sin by without a satisfaction would be to sanction
an irregularity in the order and beauty of the universe, and to set
wicked and righteous on the same level; and the very perfection of God
forbids this.  Since, therefore, a satisfaction is absolutely
necessary, has fallen man the power to render it?  Beatrice replies
that the very nature of the sin makes this impossible.  It was a sin of
pride, and pride which aimed at the highest -- `to be as gods.'  The
only adequate satisfaction would be for man to humble himself as far in
the opposite direction -- a humiliation impossible within the limits of
his human nature.  As he had sought to soar above his humanity into
Divinity, to restore the moral balance it would be necessary to stoop
into some form of existence which would degrade him beneath his
humanity.  Hence God Himself must undertake the satisfaction by the
exact reversal of Adam's pride.  Man aimed at becoming God; God fills
up the moral breach by becoming man.  The humiliation of the second
Adam is the exact counterpoise of the pride of the first [^Par.~ vii.
97-102.  Compare Augustine quoted in ^Summa~, iii. q. i. a. 2: `The
pride of man, which is the greatest hindrance to his cleaving to God,
can be rebuked and healed by the so great humility of God' -- i.e. in
the Incarnation.  So far as I can see, there is no trace in the passage
of the familiar mediaeval idea that the pride of man, being an
outrage on the honour of an infinite Being, requires an infinite
satisfaction.  `The sin being committed against God,' says Aquinas,
`has a certain infinity from the infinity of the Divine Majesty: for
the gravity of the offence is greater in proportion to the greatness of
the person outraged.  Hence for condign satisfaction it needs that the
act of him who satisfies should have an infinite efficacy' (^Summa~,
iii. q. i. a. 2)].

In the rendering of this satisfaction by which man is
reinstated in his full original life, the Divine goodness
resolved `to proceed by all its ways,' in order the better to
reveal the love of the Heart from which it flowed.  The reference
is to Psalm xxv. 10: ^Universae viae Domini misericordia et
veritas~, `All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth,' or
^justice~ as Aquinas interprets ^veritas~: `The justice of God is
fittingly called truth, because it constitutes the order in things
which conforms to the idea of His wisdom, which is His law' [^Summa~,
i. q. xxi. a. 2].  It is on these two feet of mercy and justice, to
borrow St. Bernard's quaint figure [On the Song of Songs, Serm. vi],
that, in the Incarnation, God goes forth to the great process of
salvation.  The Incarnation is a greater revelation of Divine mercy
than a mere free pardon, for two reasons: it costs God something, it is
the generous giving of Himself; and it enables man `to uplift himself'
to his original state, by the restoration of the gift of grace through
which he attains to merit salvation by good works.  On the other hand,
it secures the Divine justice, in that the humility of the Son of God
in becoming man repairs the breach in the moral order caused by the
pride of man in seeking to be as God [^Par.~ vii. 103-120.  In ^Summa~,
iii. q. xlix. a. 6, Aquinas says that `Christ in His Passion humbled
Himself beneath His dignity in four respects: (1) as to His Passion and
death, to which He was not a debtor; (2) as to place, since His body
was laid in the tomb, and His soul in Hell; (3) as to the confusion and
opprobrium which He bore; (4) in that He was delivered into the power
of man'].  It is the argument used by Aquinas: `That man be set free
by the Passion of Christ was fitting both to His mercy and to His
justice.  To justice on the one hand, because by His Passion Christ
made satisfaction for the sin of the human race, and thus man by the
justice of Christ was set free; to mercy on the other, because since
man by himself had no power to satisfy for the sin of the whole of
human nature, God gave His Son to make satisfaction, according to the
passage (Rom. iii, 24): ^Being justified freely by his grace through
the redemption that is in Christ Jesus~: ^whom God hath set forth to
be a propitiation~, ^through faith, in his blood~: and this was a more
abundant mercy than if he had remitted the sins without satisfaction'
[^Summa~, iii. q. xlvi. a. i].  In another passage Aquinas states that
while God, by virtue of His omnipotence, might have restored mankind in
many other ways, that of the Incarnation was the best fitted to secure
our salvation by giving us a foundation for ^faith~ a ground of ^hope~,
and an incentive to ^charity~ -- the virtues without which man can
never receive the Beatific Vision [^Summa~, iii. q. i. a. 2.  See below
on ^Par.~ xxxiii. 127-141].

We come now to a final question rising out of a passage
in the preceding discourse.  In vii. 67-69 Beatrice, speaking of
the Divine goodness, had said:

     `Whatso from It immediately distils
      Thereafter hath no end, for never removed
      Is its imprint, whene'er It sets the seal.'
          [^Par.~ vii. 67-69.  See {also comm. to ^Par.~ 13.46-87}.]

In other words, what God creates without any intervening medium
is for that reason immortal and incorruptible: how can this be
true when we see fire, air, earth, and all the compounds of them
`come to corruption and endure but little'?  Are these things not
`creatures,' and if so, why are they not secure against
corruption?  Beatrice replies by explaining that creation
properly so-called is when a thing is brought into existence in
its entire being `even as it is' -- that is, without
transformation from previously created substances, or through
previously created agencies.  The Angels and the Heavens ('the
pure country in which thou art,' ll. 130, 131) are examples of
this immediate creation -- creation proper out of nothing.  But
the elements and all their compounds are informed by a power
which was itself created: the ^prima materia~ of the elements and
the virtue in the stars which gives to this first matter its
specific `forms'; and these are the immediate incorruptible
creations out of which the corruptible elements issue.  Similarly,
the souls of brutes and plants -- the `sensitive' and `vegetative'
souls -- are drawn into existence, not immediately by God, but by the
stars, `the ray and movement of the holy lights' [`The ^rays~ of each
heaven are the way by which their virtue descends on things here below'
(^Conv.~ ii. 7).  See above {^Introduction~}], acting on what Beatrice
calls ^complession potenziata~, `potentiated constitution' or
`temperament' -- that is, a temperament with a potency to become
sensitive and vegetative souls, and therefore subject to corruption. 
But it is otherwise with the rational human soul, which is immortal
because inbreathed immediately by the Highest Goodness, which enamours
it with a never-ending yearning for Itself.  From this principle that
whatever is immediately created by God is incorruptible, Beatrice
invites Dante to draw the inference of the resurrection of the body. 
The flesh of the First Parents came without medium from the hand of God
[in ^Summa~, i. q. xci. a. 2, Aquinas says `the first formation of the
human body could not be by any created virtue, but immediately by God,'
to whom alone belongs the power to create form without any natural
precedent form.  Hence the first man must have been created by God,
since there existed then no other from whom by means of generation a
like species could have originated.  He adds that there may have been
some ministry of Angels in this formation of the first human body, as
there may be afterwards in the resurrection.  In ^Summa~, q. xcii. a.
4, he adds that woman was also formed immediately by God, since, being
made of other matter than that from which man is usually generated, she
could have been made by no other], and is therefore imperishable; and
Dante apparently regards the bodies of their descendants as sharing in
the same imperishable nature.  It is not easy to reconcile this with
the doctrine of the Church, or with Dante's own words in this Canto. 
According to Aquinas, the bodies of the First Parents, though created
immediately by God, had no inherent immortality by nature: immortality
was a distinct gift of grace, bestowed in the act of creation.  On
account of sin this gift was withdrawn, and their bodies lapsed back to
their natural liability to corruption; and it is only by the
restoration of grace through the Incarnation and Passion of Christ,
that the resurrection becomes possible.  [In ^Summa~, i. q. xcvii. a.
1, Aquinas says that man in a state of innocence would have been
immortal, not because his body possessed any inherent power of
incorruptibility, but because of a supernatural gift bestowed on his
soul by which the body would have been preserved from corruption so
long as he remained subject to God.  Although Adam after the Fall
recovered grace and the power of meriting glory, he did not immediately
recover his lost immortality.  That comes only through the resurrection
of Christ, which is the source and model of ours.  A passage in ^Contra
Gentiles~ (iv. 81) may be quoted: `In the first creation of human
nature God endowed the human body with an attribute over and above what
was due to it by the natural principles of its constitution, namely,
with a certain imperishability, to adapt it to its ^form~, that as the
life of the soul is perpetual, so the body might perpetually live by
the soul.  Granting that this imperishability was not natural in regard
to its active principle [i.e. the "organism" of the body, as Father
Rickaby, whose version I quote, explains it], still it may be called
natural in regard of the end, taking the end of matter to be
proportioned to its natural form.  When then, contrary to the order of
its nature, the soul turned away from God, there was withdrawn from the
body that God-given constitution which made it proportionate to the
soul; and death ensued.  Considering then how human nature was actually
constituted to begin with, we may say that death is something which has
accidentally supervened upon man through sin.  This accident has been
removed by Christ, who by the merit of His passion and death has
destroyed death.  Consequently that same divine power, which originally 
endowed the body with incorruption, will restore the body again from
death to life.']  This, indeed, seems to be Dante's own view in the
passage expounded above [^Par.~ vii. 67-120], yet here he appears to
assume another source of the resurrection of the body -- the immediacy,
namely, of its creation by God.  His meaning, however, may be that this
immediacy forms the very ground and possibility of the restoration of
physical immortality: had man's body come from any other than God's own
hand, even the Resurrection of Christ might have been powerless to
rescue it from the bondage of its own natural corruption.
