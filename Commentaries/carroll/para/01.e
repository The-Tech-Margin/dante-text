	|1-12.~  In the Epistle in which he dedicates the ^Paradiso~ to his 
friend and patron, Can Grande della Scala, Lord of Verona, Dante gives 
an exposition of the first twelve lines of the opening Canto, which, he 
says, form part of the Prologue to this third division of the 
^Commedia.~  [Following Aristotle's ^Rhetoric~ (iii. 14), he says `the 
^proem~ is the beginning in a rhetorical oration, as the ^prologue~ is 
in poetry, and the ^prelude~ in flute-playing.'  I assume the 
genuineness of the Epistle to Can Grande.  The subject is fully and, to 
my mind, convincingly discussed in Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd 
series, pp. 284-369.  The references throughout are to Dr. Moore's 
Oxford edition of Dante's works].  After a few words about the 
invocation which begins at the thirteenth line, he suddenly breaks off 
with a pathetic confession of poverty: `This is the meaning of the 
second part of the Prologue in general; but in detail I will not 
expound it at present, for narrow household circumstances so press upon 
me that these and other things profitable for the common weal, I am 
forced to relinquish.  But I hope of your magnificence that means may 
be otherwise provided of proceeding to a profitable exposition'
[^Epis.~ x. 32.  For Dante's meaning of `magnificence,' see ^Conv.~ iv. 
17].  If we are ever tempted to wish that we had Dante's own commentary 
on the entire poem, this fragment may partly reconcile us to the 
loss.  The greatest lover of Dante must surely confess that it is dry 
and scholastic in the extreme, and itself stands in need of a 
commentary.  The subject of the ^Paradiso~, he says, is `man, in so far 
as by meriting he is liable to rewarding justice': Heaven being 
regarded as the just reward of human merit.  [It is to be remembered 
that, acording to the teaching of the Church, human merit is in no 
sense independent of Divine grace: without grace meritorious works are 
impossible.  See below {comm. to ^Par.~ 25.67-69}].  The end of this as
of the other parts of the poem is `to remove those living in this life
from the state of misery and lead them to the state of felicity.'  His
aim in the Prologue is to render his readers sympathetic, attentive, and 
teachable: ^sympathetic~, because of the profitableness of the subject, 
the joys of Paradise for which all men long; ^attentive~, because of 
the marvellous tidings he brings of the nature of the Kingdom of 
Heaven; and ^teachable~, because the things he saw are possible to 
others, who ought therefore to be willing to learn.  The exposition of 
the Prologue, which begins at this point, is carried on after Dante's 
manner by an appeal first to reason and then to the authority of Holy 
Scripture.  A paraphrase of the lines commented on may make it easier 
to follow the exposition in detail: `The light of God shines throughout 
the entire universe, according to the power of the various creatures to 
receive it.  I, Dante, have been in the Empyrean, the Heaven which 
receives it in greatest fulness.  For that very reason, power fails me 
to relate the things I saw; for the nearer we approach God, the end of 
all desire, the more the intellect engulfs itself, and memory becomes 
powerless to recall the full and final vision.  But whatsoever of the 
Holy Kingdom my mind has been able to treasure up will now be the 
matter of my song.'  One is tempted to content one's self with this 
paraphrase, were it not that Dante's own exposition of the lines may 
form a slight introduction to certain forms of scholastic and mystical 
thought which pervade the entire Cantica.  The opening ^terzina~ runs 
thus: 

     The glory of Him who moveth everything 
     Penetrates through the universe, and shines back 
     In one part more, and in another less. 

What underlies this is the Aristotelian conception of God as the 
unmoved Mover of the universe.  As we saw in the Introduction, to 
a Divine Being motion is impossible, because motion implies want, 
and God wants nothing.  Possessing in His own being everything 
essential to perfect blessedness, He remains for ever at rest in 
the contemplation of Himself.  `Everything that is moved,' says 
Aquinas, `by its motion acquires something, and attains to that 
to which formerly it had not attained.  But God, since He is 
infinite, comprehending in Himself the entire plenitude of the 
perfection of all that is, cannot acquire anything, nor extend 
Himself to anything to which He had not formerly attained. 
Therefore in no manner does motion pertain to Him.  And thence is 
it that certain of the ancients, as if forced by truth itself, 
laid it down that the First Principle is immovable' [^Summa~, i. q. ix. 
a. i].  It is this Divine unchangeable `plenitude of perfection' which 
sets the entire wheel of Nature in motion with longing for union with 
itself. 

Also, it is the glory of this First Mover which is 
reflected in all things, more or less according to their nature, 
just as stone, gold, diamond receive and render back the sunlight in 
diverse modes [^Conv.~ iii. 7].  In the ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ (i. 
16) Dante says that God `is more perceptible in a man than in a brute, 
in an animal than in a plant, in a plant than in a mineral, in a 
mineral than in fire, in fire than in earth.'  The idea is dwelt on in 
many passages, and in the Epistle to Can Grande is established by the 
double authority of reason and Scripture.  A good example of Dante's 
scholastic method is the subtle interpretation of the words in l. 2, 
^penetra e risplende~ -- `penetrates and shines back': `Well therefore 
is it said, when it says that the Divine ray, or the Divine glory, 
through the universe ^penetrates and shines back.~  ^Penetrates~ as to 
essence (^essentia~); ^shines back~ as to being (^esse~)' [^Ep.~ x. 
23].  It is safe to say that this is a significance which no modern 
commentator would ever have guessed; and it is by no means easy to know 
what Dante understood by it.  In scholastic phraseology, the essence of 
a thing is its inmost being whereby it is what it is; and the conception 
of it is reached by the intellect abstracting it from all the 
accidental qualities of the thing.  For instance, the essence of ^man~ 
is not a fair or dark complexion, tallness or shortness, youth or age, 
or any of the accidental qualities which are found in individuals.  The 
essence is the something which we call humanity, the something which is 
common to all individuals of the species, and which the intellect 
reaches by abstraction from their individualizing qualities.  On the 
other hand, the ^esse~ or being of anything is just its existence as an 
individual, with all the qualities which make it an individual.  When, 
therefore, Dante says that the glory of God ^penetrates~ as to essence 
he is giving expression to one of the profoundest of his metaphysical 
convictions, that the mysterious something which constitutes the nature 
of each species of creatures is a ray of the light of God; and when he 
says that it ^shines back~ as to ^esse~ or being, he means that this 
essential light comes reflected back through the individual creature as 
such, through the accidental qualities which make him an individual. 
It is perhaps scarcely worth while occupying so much space with an 
explanation which may prove to be none and only weary the reader.  But 
the time may not be wasted if it shows us how, in the first place, 
Dante under what seem mere poetic phrases often conceals profound 
philosophical and religious meanings; and, in the second place, how he 
conceived of the entire universe, essence and being, species and 
individual, substance and accident, as an emanation and a mirror of the 
Divine glory.  The best commentary on the ^penetra e risplende~ of the 
Prologue is the mysteriously beautiful vision of the universe in God 
which he sees in the Eternal Light of the highest Heaven: 

     I saw that in its depth far down is lying, 
     Bound up with love together in one volume, 
     What through the universe in leaves is scattered; 
     Substance and accidents and their operations, 
     All interfused together in such wise 
     That what I speak of is one simple light. 
     The universal form of this knot 
     Methinks I saw, since more abundantly 
     In saying this I feel that I rejoice. 
     [^Par.~ xxxiii. 85-93.  See {comm. to the passage, ^ivi~}.] 

Dante proceeds in his exposition to explain what he means 
when he says that he had been in the Heaven which receives most 
of the light of God -- the supreme Heaven, `containing all the 
bodies of the universe and contained by none.'  `It is called the 
^Empyrean~, which is the same as the heaven glowing with fire or 
heat; not because there is in it material fire or heat, but 
spiritual, which is holy love or charity.'  The principal proof 
that it receives most of the Divine light is `its eternal quiet 
or peace.'  The argument rests on the scholastic doctrine 
explained above, that motion implies defect: `Everything that 
moves, moves on account of something which it has not, and which 
is the goal of its motion.'  The absolute rest of the Empyrean is 
the proof of its perfection; `and since all perfection is a ray of 
the First, which exists in the highest degree of perfection, it 
is manifest that the first Heaven receives more of the light of the 
First, which is God' [^Ep.~ x. 24-26.  The idea which underlies this 
argument is that the intellect cannot rest until it sees the full light 
of God; therefore the Heaven which is perfect rest must be that which 
receives the largest measure of that light]. 

In the last place, Dante proceeds to explain what he 
means when he says that he is powerless to relate the things he 
saw in this highest Heaven: 

                    I saw things which to re-tell 
     Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends; 
     Because, in drawing near to its desire, 
     Our intellect engulfs itself so far 
     That after it the memory cannot go. 
 
Dante's exposition of these lines rests on the conception of the 
Beatific Vision as explained in the Introduction.  It is the sight of God
face to face, as friend sees friend.  The organ of vision is the
intellect, that part of us which is nearest God, and which can never be
satisfied until it pass behind all second causes to the First Cause,
behind all symbols to the Truth, all accidents to the Eternal Substance. 
But this is possible only by man rising above himself, transcending the
natural limits of his being by the supernatural illumination of grace. 
It follows that the intellect having sunk itself profoundly in a
^supernatural~ life, when it returns to the old limits of the ^natural~,
the memory fails to bridge the almost infinite gulf between the two
worlds of experience.   [Cf. Augustine's ^Confessions~, Book X. in which
he dwells on the wonderful power of memory, yet declares that he must go
beyond memory to find God: `Great is the power of memory, a fearful
thing, O my God, a deep and boundless manifoldness; and this thing is the
mind, and this am I myself....  What shall I do then, O Thou my true
life, my God?  I will pass even beyond this power of mine which is called
memory: yea, I will pass beyond it, that I may approach unto Thee, O
sweet Light' (Pusey's translation).  Compare Tennyson's trance in ^In
Memoriam~, xcv.: 
 
     Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame 
       In matter-moulded forms of speech, 
       Or even for intellect to reach 
     Thro' memory that which I became]. 
 
As instances of this failure of memory he gives the visions of St. 
Paul, of the three disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration, and of 
the Prophet Ezekiel.  And then he adds an interesting passage which 
reveals some of the sources of his own vision, and at the same time 
hints not obscurely at the sneers which were probably flung at him and 
it by some of his contemporaries: `And wherein these examples do not 
suffice for the invidious, let them read Richard of Saint Victor, in 
the book ^De Contemplatione~; let them read Bernard, in the book ^De 
Consideratione~; let them read Augustine, in the book, ^De Quantitate 
Animae~, and they will be invidious no longer.  But if they should rail 
at the assignment of so great an exaltation on account of the sin of 
the speaker, let them read Daniel, where they will find that even 
Nabuchodonosor by Divine means saw certain things against sinners, and 
committed them to oblivion.  For "He who maketh his sun to rise on the 
evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust," 
sometimes in compassion, for their conversion, sometimes in severity, 
for their punishment, manifests His glory more or less, as He wills, to 
those who live never so evilly' [^Ep.~ x. 28].  One can well believe 
that there were not lacking among Dante's contemporaries those who 
found it easier to believe that he had visited Hell, than that he had 
been in the Heaven which receives most of the Divine Light.  Dante 
himself never doubted that, sinful man as he was, he had been as 
divinely chosen and inspired for this Vision as any of the prophets of 
ancient Israel. 
 
     The exposition ends with the reason for his saying that 
he who returns to earth from that highest Heaven `neither knows, 
nor can' retell the vision.  `He ^knows not~, because he has 
forgotten; he ^cannot~, because even if he remember and retain 
the substance, nevertheless language fails: for by the intellect 
we see many things for which the vocal signs are wanting; which 
Plato sufficiently suggests in his books by the adoption of 
metaphors: for by intellectual light he saw many things which he 
was unable to express in the language proper to them' [Cf. ^Inf.~ 
xxviii. 4; ^Conv.~ iii. 4: `A limit is set to our intelligence, in each 
of its operations, not by us, but by universal Nature; and therefore it 
is to be known that the boundaries of the intelligence are wider in 
thought than in speech, and wider in speech than in signs.'  Dante adds 
that man is not responsible for these limitations, since they are not 
of his making]. 
 
     The exposition, as we saw, breaks off suddenly with a pathetic 
appeal for help, and Dante closes the Letter with a general statement 
of what is contained in the `executive part' -- that is from line 37 of 
the Canto to the end of the poem: `There will be a process of ascension 
from heaven to heaven, and the narrative will tell of the blessed souls 
found in each orb, and that true blessedness consists in knowing the 
Source of Truth, as is evident by John where he says: "This is true 
blessedness, that they may know thee, the true God," etc.; and by 
Boethius in the third of ^De Consolatione~, where he says: "To see thee 
is the end."  Hence it is that, in order to show forth the glory of 
blessedness in those souls, many things which have great profit and 
delight will be asked of them, as of those who see all truth.  And 
because, when the Source or First, namely God, is found, there is 
nothing to be sought beyond, since He is Alpha and Omega, that is, the 
Beginning and the End, as the vision of John denotes, the treatise ends 
in God Himself, who is blessed ^in saecula saeculorum.~' 
 
     From this point onward we are left to our own guidance, 
and it may be well to remind ourselves of the poet's warning in 
the beginning of the Second Canto -- if, indeed, we are of the 
chosen few `who lift their necks betimes to the bread of the 
angels' -- to keep the furrow of his keel in front of our little 
bark, lest losing him we lose ourselves.  Nothing is easier than 
to lose him on those high seas of eternity, especially if we seek 
to read into his words a meaning of our own, instead of being 
content to learn his. 
 
	|13-21.~  A comparison of the invocation in the ^Paradiso~ with 
those in the preceding Cantiche will show us that Dante felt he 
had now come to the final and supreme labour of his life.  In the 
^Inferno~ he regards `the memory which errs not' as sufficient to 
the task of describing sin and its punishments, and therefore he 
invokes simply the Muses, the spirit of Genius, and the natural 
human powers: 
 
     O Muses, O lofty Genius, now assist me! 
     O Memory, that didst write down what I saw, 
     Here thy nobility shall be made manifest! 
                         [^Inf.~ ii. 7-9.] 
 
In the ^Purgatorio~, which deals with a more sacred theme, his 
invocation is to the Holy Muses, and in especial to Calliope, the 
Muse of Epic poetry [^Purg.~ i. 9].  In the ^Paradiso~, however, where 
the subject rises so far beyond the mere natural powers that memory 
fails, he appeals to the loftiest supernatural power: `O good Apollo!' 
-- the Sun-god standing in Dante's mind for the inspiration of the true 
Eternal Light [v. 13.  A parallel case is in ^Purg.~ vi. 118, where
Christ is addressed as `sommo Giove,' `supreme Jove.'  In ^Conv.~ 
iii. 12, God is called `the spiritual Sun, accessible to the 
intellect.'  `No object of sense in all the universe is more worthy to 
be made the symbol of God than the sun, which enlightens, with the 
light of sense, first itself, and then all the celestial and elemental 
bodies; and in like manner God illuminates first Himself with 
intellectual light, and then the celestial and other creatures 
accessible to the intellect' (Wicksteed's transl.)].  As he says in 
the Epistle to Can Grande (18), poets `have need of a great 
invocation, since something beyond the common scope of men is to be 
sought from the higher substances: a certain gift almost divine.'  In 
the Second Canto (ll. 8, 9) he feels that his prayer is answered: 
 
     Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo, 
     And Muses nine point out to me the Bears, -- 
 
the polar stars, by which to steer his course across an unknown sea. 
[I follow Dr. Moore's reading `^nove~ Muse,' ^nine~ Muses, rather than 
`^nuove~,' ^new~.  The chief point in favour of the latter is that as 
Dante is sailing over a new, untravelled sea, he needed new Muses to 
point him to the stars; `but on the other hand,' as Butler says, `no 
one has explained why new Muses should be required, but not a new 
Minerva or Apollo'].  The reference in lines 16-18 of the present 
Canto to the two yokes of Parnassus, through obscure, indicates Dante's 
sense of the greatness of this his `last labour,' his `final arena.' 
[Landino says: `^Aringo~ in Tuscan signifies pulpit, and an elevated 
place, from which we say ^ringhiera~ (platform or balcony).  Then by 
similitude the yoke is called ^aringo.~']  It is impossible to say with 
certainty what exactly he meant by the two yokes, about which much 
confusion existed among post-classical writers.  From his reference to 
`Cirra' in l. 36, the probability is that he was following Isidore of 
Seville, whose ^Origines~ he must have known, in which the two peaks 
are named Cirra and Nisa, the former, it is said, being dedicated to 
Apollo, the latter to Liber or Bacchus. 
 
     From Mr. Tozer's full and clear note, which I take the 
liberty of quoting below, there is no ground for this division of 
the two peaks between these divinities, or between Apollo and the 
Muses [`It is well to notice the origin of the idea concerning the 
summits of Parnassus, from which Dante's metaphorical language is 
drawn.  That mountain rises to a single conspicuous summit; and when 
the Greek poets speak of its two summits (Soph. ^Ant.~ 1126; Eurip. 
^Bacch.~ 307; cp. ^Ion.~ 86-8) they mean, not the real summit of the 
mountain, but the two peaks that rise above Delphi, which are several 
thousand feet lower.  These expressions were misunderstood by the 
Roman poets, who regularly describe Parnassus as rising to two summits; 
e.g. Ov. ^Met.~ i. 316, "Mons ibi verticibus petit arduus astra duobus, 
Nomine Parnassus"; Lucan, v. 72, "Parnassus gemino petit aethera 
colle."  Dante followed them, and naturally fell into the same 
mistake.  Then, as Parnassus is the representative of poetic 
inspiration, he quaintly regards the two summits as a double portion of 
that inspiration.  There is no sufficient ground for saying, as some 
commentators do, that one peak was sacred to Apollo, the other to 
Bacchus and the Muses; and that when the two peaks are named it is 
implied that Dante, who has hitherto invoked the Muses, now invokes 
Apollo also.  Great confusion existed in the minds of post-classical 
writers about these two (supposed) peaks of Parnassus, and by some -- 
e.g. Servius (on Aen. vii. 641 and x. 163) and Isidore (^Orig.~ xiv. 8) 
-- they were identified with Helicon and Cithaeron.  But the two 
divinities to whom they were regarded as being sacred were Apollo and 
Bacchus; and no writer, so far as we know, with whom Dante was 
acquainted, regarded one peak as dedicated to Apollo and the other to 
the Muses' (^English Commentary~, 405-6).  The fact remains, of course, 
that while the Muses are invoked in the ^Inferno~ and ^Purgatorio~, 
this is the first invocation to Apollo]; and it is impossible to 
suppose that Dante invokes Bacchus for inspiration to recall to memory 
the Beatific Vision.  We are forced to content ourselves with the 
general idea that for this final task he felt his need of a double 
portion of Divine inspiration; or perhaps, more specifically, that up 
to this point in the poem the natural faculties had sufficed, but that 
now a supernatural power must lift the natural man above himself. 
This, indeed, may be the meaning of the mysterious prayer to Apollo: 
 
     Enter thou into my breast, and breathe, 
     Even as when Marsyas thou didst draw 
     From out the scabbard of his limbs. 
                         [vv. 19-21.] 
 
The reference is to the fate of Marsyas, the Phrygian satyr. 
Having presumptuously challenged Apollo to a contest in music, 
the god after conquering him tied him to a tree and flayed him 
alive.  It is possible to find here, as some do, a veiled warning 
to the poet's rivals -- the `invidious' of the Epistle to Can 
Grande -- that the fate of Marsyas will be theirs; but a pride so 
scornful is inconsistent with the hope expressed a few lines 
further on, that the little spark of his poem may kindle a great 
flame, and that better prayers will gain an answer from Cirrha, 
the peak regarded as sacred to Apollo.  [It cannot be without purpose, 
however, that a similar myth is referred to in the invocation to the 
`Holy Muses,' in ^Purg.~ i. 7-12, where Dante prays Calliope to `rise 
somewhat,' 
 
     Accompanying my song with that sound 
     Of which the miserable Magpies felt 
     The blow so great that they despaired of pardon. 
 
The reference is to the nine daughters of Pierus, King of Emathia, 
in Macedon, who, on challenging the Muses to a contest and being 
defeated, were changed into magpies.  It is certainly strange that 
Dante could not invoke aid for himself as a poet without thinking of 
the defeat and punishment of proud, presumptuous singers.  Perhaps it 
was his way of avoiding a similar pride].  A truer and deeper meaning 
is suggested in the MS. note of Coleridge in Cary's Dante in the 
British Museum: `He asks for an evacuation or exinanition of all self 
in him, like the unsheathing of Marsyas, that so he may become a mere 
vessel or wine-skin of the Deity,' a meaning which would certainly fit 
in with the `transhumanize' of line 70, the transcending of the limits 
of humanity. 
 
	|22-36.~  There is something pathetic in the peculiar mingling of 
pride and humility in Dante's longing for the laurel crown.  It 
breaks out even in the Stellar Heaven, where he consoles himself 
with the thought that, while his own `fair sheepfold' held him in 
cruel exile and refused the honour, Peter himself, the chief 
Shepherd, on hearing the confession of his faith, did not disdain 
to make of his own starry light a better crown for his fast-whitening 
brow [^Par.~ xxiv. 151-xxv. 12.  See {comm. to ^Par.~ 25.1-12}].  One
remembers too how, in his first Eclogue to Giovanni del Virgilio (ll.
42-4) he puts aside his friend's offer of the crown from Bologna, too
proud to take from another what his `ancestral Arno' denied him.  The
hope, however, seems never to have died out of his heart; in the passage 
before us he thinks that if in this final Cantica he is able to give 
even `the shadow of the blessed realm,' it must bring him the much 
longed-for garland.  And then, with a sudden humility as deep as his 
pride, he ends with the hope that his little spark may kindle a great 
flame, and the laurel fall upon some worthier brow.  [Compare ^Inf.~ iv.
79-102, where Dante ranks himself with those whom he regarded as the five
greatest poets, Homer and Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan.  Boccaccio in
his Life of Dante has a curious digression in which he finds good reason
for Dante's longing for the laurel in three properties of that plant: (1)
it never looses its verdure, and is therefore a symbol of enduring fame;
(2) it is never found to have been struck with lightning -- the
lightning, in the figurative sense, of envy and the thunderbolt of time;
(3) it is very sweet smelling, as are the works of all great poets.  No
wonder, he thinks, that Dante longed to be worthy of such a crown.] 
 
	|37-48.~  We come now to the ascent through the Sphere of Fire to
the Heaven of the Moon.  Line 37, which begins what Dante calls 
`the executive part,' must be regarded as a direct continuation 
of the closing words of the ^Purgatorio.~  It is a mistake to 
assume any interval of time: certainly none is even hinted at. 
The last note of time given is in ^Purg.~ xxxiii. 103, 104, 
where Dante tells us that `the sun was holding the meridian 
circle' when a draught of the River Euno,e made him `pure and 
disposed to mount unto the stars.'  To say, as many do, that he 
did not ascend till the following morning at sunrise, leaves a 
period of eighteen hours entirely unaccounted for, and destroys 
the mystic parallelism of time which obviously runs through the 
whole poem.  There is no justification for this beyond the 
mention of `morning' in l. 43, which is assumed to mean the 
^following~ morning.  An examination of the passage will show the 
true meaning.  It runs as follows: 
 
     To mortal men by passages diverse 
     Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one 
     Which circles four uniteth with three crosses, 
     With better course and with a better star 
     Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax 
     Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion. 
     Almost that passage had made morning there 
     And evening here, and there was wholly white 
     That hemisphere, and black the other part, 
     When Beatrice towards the left-hand side 
     I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun; 
     Never did eagle fasten so upon it. 
 
     Dante's general purpose in this difficult passage is to 
tell us that his ascent to Paradise took place ^at the most 
auspicious time~, when all the powers of heaven and earth 
conspired to make his journey prosperous.  First of all, it was 
the most gracious season of the year.  In the circle of the year 
the sun rises at various points; but there is one passage -- that 
of the vernal equinox -- in which a happy conjunction of 
celestial forces gives it its noblest power over earthly things. 
It is then in Aries, `a better star,' because it ushers in the spring and
begins `a better course.'  This passage, which the sun was `almost' at
(^quasi~ in l. 44 refers to the fact that the vernal equinox was slightly
past [Mr. Tozer says, `it was now April 13, and the vernal equinox was on
March 21']), is described as that which `unites four circles with three
crosses.'  These, in the literal sense, are the circles of the equator,
the ecliptic, and the equinoctial colure, which, by intersection with one
another and with the fourth circle of the horizon, make three crosses. 
There can be no doubt that to Dante, who saw in the sun the sensible
image of God, and in the conjunctions of the Heavens the means by which
He stamps His image on `the mundane wax,' all this had a deep symbolic
meaning.  The four circles and the three crosses are, allegorically, the
four cardinal and the three theological virtues -- changed now from the
form of nymphs in which he saw them in the Earthly Paradise to their
celestial equivalents.  The full allegorical meaning, then, seems to be:
when the four cardinal virtues in full circle intersect, so to speak, in
human life and character with the three theological, then God, the
Eternal Sun, coming to man by the passage of this conjunction, is able
most clearly to impress His image as a seal on wax.  It is, indeed, 
precisely the greater or less perfection of this conjunction of the 
seven virtues which constitutes the various degrees of blessedness of 
the seven lower Heavens into which Dante is about to enter.  If any one
cares to see, with Mr. Gardner, the further meaning, that since the
cardinal virtues are more closely connected with the Empire, and the
theological with the Church, Dante may have meant that, `in that age of
conflicting claims of Pope and Emperor, God shone most upon a soul
prepared to fulfil the duty of rendering to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's and to God the things that are God's,' there is certainly much
to justify it in Dante's ideal of Church and Empire.  But only in his
^ideal.~  We must not forget that to him the actual Empire was the
despoiled Tree which he pictures in the Earthly Paradise, and the Church
the ruined Chariot which he saw torn from it into captivity: nothing is
now left to him but Beatrice, the ideal Heavenly Wisdom, and her
handmaidens. 
 
     We naturally expect that the hour of the day will have a 
nobility corresponding to that of the season; and we know that 
Dante regarded noon as the most noble of the twenty-four.  In the 
^Convito~ (iv. 23) he says expressly that `the sixth hour, that 
is, noon, is the most noble of the whole day, and has the most 
virtue,' and for this reason was the hour, according to Luke, at 
which our Lord died.  It was also the hour, says Bonaventura, at 
which He ascended to Heaven; and he emphasizes the sacredness of 
it by representing it as the hour at which the exulting praise of 
the Angels passed on and up from choir to choir of the Nine 
Orders: `For the Ascension of the Lord was at the sixth hour.... 
Although all those in the Fatherland (^in patria~) made 
exultation beyond the power of words to tell, yet from the first 
day (i.e. the day of the Ascension) to the sixth hour of the day 
following, the Angels in especial kept festival....  On the 
second day the Archangels did likewise, on the third the 
Principalities, on the fourth the Powers, on the fifth the 
Virtues, on the sixth the Dominations, on the seventh the 
Thrones, on the eighth the Cherubim, on the ninth the Seraphim, which 
are the Nine Orders of Angels' [^Meditationes Vitae Christi,~ ch. 
xcviii].  Bearing all this in mind, we ought to be careful not to 
break the mystic correspondence of time between Dante and his Lord 
which runs through the ^Commedia~: at ^sunset~ Dante descended with 
Christ into Hell; at ^sunrise~ he rose with Him into the new life; at 
^mid-day~ he ascended to the Heaven to which He ascended. 
 
     The chief difficulty of this interpretation is the 
mention of `morning' in l. 43: `such a passage had made morning 
on that side' (^di l@a~, i.e. on Mount Purgatory), `and evening 
on this' (^di qua~, i.e. in the north hemisphere, in which Dante 
is writing).  Doubtless if `morning' is taken in the strict sense 
of sunrise, the other interpretation would hold; but Dante's 
words immediately after make this strict sense impossible: `there 
was ^wholly~ white that hemisphere' (the one in which Mount 
Purgatory was), `and black the other part' (the north 
hemisphere).  This could not be the case at sunrise: the 
Purgatorial hemisphere then would be only partially illuminated, 
and the north hemisphere only partially darkened.  As Dr. Moore 
says, `noon is involved in the statement that the ^whole~ of the 
south hemisphere was light, the mountain of Purgatory being its 
central point, just as Jerusalem was of the north hemisphere, the 
^whole~ of which was consequently dark' [^Studies in Dante~, 3rd 
series, 62 n.  Dr. Moore here retracts the view expressed in his ^Time 
References~ (53 n.), that the hour was sunrise.  It may seem a small 
matter to spend so much time over, but to Dante himself it was of great 
importance.  Mr. Gardner has stated clearly the reasons for the noon 
hour (^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 34-37).  Mr. Tozer's note is valuable: 
`The difficulty of this passage arises from the Poet having introduced 
into one sentence two times of day, viz. sunrise -- which is mentioned 
in connexion with the preceding six lines in order to determine the 
season of the year -- and midday, which is the time intended in the 
narrative.  This difficulty disappears, if we give due weight to the 
tenses of the verbs, pluperfect and imperfect respectively' (^Eng. 
Comm.~ 408)]. 
 
	|49-64.~  We come now to the beginning of the Ascension.  Dante and 
Beatrice, it must be remembered, are still standing on the bank 
of Euno,e in the Earthly Paradise.  The very memory of sin has 
been blotted out.  God, in His highest natural symbol, the Sun, 
is shining on Dante in meridian fulness, through the conjunction 
of the four natural with the three supernatural virtues.  In 
other words, Dante being now in the Garden of Eden, `the place 
made as proper to the human race' (ll. 56, 57), has returned, as 
far as return is possible, to the original righteousness and powers of 
the first man [`The head and aim of all the Christian mysteries is my 
perfection and restoration and return to the first Adam' (St. Gregory 
of Nazianzus, quoted in Father Hunter's ^Outlines of Dogmatic 
Theology~, ii. 374)].  The ideal situation, therefore, is that he is 
now starting from the state from which Adam would have started, had he 
retained his integrity.  By nature Adam had the four cardinal virtues, 
and by grace the three theological, without which he could not see God. 
[The much debated question whether Adam received grace in the first 
instant of his creation or at some later time before his Fall, is left 
open by the Church.  The former view was that of Aquinas, and is the 
received teaching of the Church at the present time.  It follows that 
Adam had all the virtues, natural and supernatural (^Summa~, i. q. xcv. 
a. 1, 3)]; and Dante's long climb up the purifying Mount had simply 
undone the Fall and brought him back to the state of virtue which the 
First Father lost.  From this necessary standing-ground of nature and 
grace, the ascent begins.  Beatrice, turning on her left side [this 
left-hand movement may surprise us, the left being the direction in the 
Inferno, and the right in Purgatory.  The physical reason is plain: at 
noon in the south hemisphere the sun would be northward, and Beatrice 
who had been facing the east, of necessity turned on her left side to 
see the sun.  If any symbolism is meant it may be connected with the 
fact that the left is the side of the heart], fixes her eyes like an 
eagle on the sun; and her attitude, like a ray of light, reflects 
itself in Dante by turning his eyes upward in the same gaze of 
contemplation.  The virtues of Eden, now restored, gave him a power of 
looking at the sun far surpassing that of the fallen world below; yet 
even there his eyes were able to bear the brightness only long enough 
to see the sun's circumference break out into sparks like iron issuing 
from the fire.  And then 
 
     Of a sudden it seemed that day to day 
     Was added, as if He who has the power 
     Had with another sun the heaven adorned.  {vv. 61-63.}
 
[`The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light
of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day
that the Lord bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke
of the wound' (Is. xxx. 26).]  This represents the vast increase of
knowledge which would have come to Adam had he remained in his first
estate, and which Dante receives because he has regained it, -- not the
direct vision of the Divine Essence, but power to see the sparks which it
flung forth -- its operations and effects in creation.  [In ^Par.~
xxviii. 88-90, Dante uses the same figure of the sparks of molten iron to
indicate the individual Angels of the nine concentric circles of fire
which represent the Nine Orders.]  This knowledge even of the sparks of
the Divine Being added day to day, doubled the light of all his seeing. 
In short, what Dante sees up to this point is simply what is natural to
man in his original state, the knowledge which would have come to him
from his natural powers, quickened by grace, and directed to the effects
and operations of God in the natural world.  [Perhaps one ought rather to
say that it represents the knowledge Adam actually had before the Fall,
in which Dante here shares.  In ^Summa~, i. q. xciv, Aquinas says the
first man did not see the essence of God, else sin had been impossible;
`he saw God in an aenigma, because he saw God by means of the created 
effect.'  At the same time his knowledge was far clearer than ours: `the 
first man was not hindered by exterior things (as we are) from clear 
and firm contemplation of intelligible effects, which he perceived by 
irradation of the Primal Truth, either by knowledge natural or of 
grace.'  He adds that he had knowledge of all things naturally 
knowable, and of supernatural things in so far as they were necessary 
for the supernatural end for which he was created -- things which we 
can know only by revelation and faith.  The interpretation given above 
is substantially that of Landino, though he does not connect it with 
man's original state: `The allegorical sense is that the purified mind 
can contemplate God, but not in such manner that it knows His essence, 
but it has knowledge of the sparks which come from the sun, that is, of 
the effects which proceed from God, because we know the cause through 
the effects, and not the effects through the cause.'] 
 
     This, however, is not the end for which man was made, and 
therefore Dante turns from the sparks of the Divine Light in 
creation to Beatrice.  Mr. Gardner thinks this turning to 
Beatrice was necessary because `she is invested with the 
ecclesiastical authority appointed by God to lead mankind to 
eternal life in accordance with revelation, and by means of 
theology to interpret the mysteries which would otherwise dazzle our 
intellectual eyesight' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 38]; but we must 
bear in mind, as already pointed out, that for Dante no `ecclesiastical 
authority' now exists.  `The first Peter' declares that his place is 
vacant `in the presence of the Son of God' [^Par.~ xxvii. 22-24].  The 
church `was, and is not' [^Purg.~ xxxiii. 34-36].  If, then, Beatrice 
represents any ecclesiastical authority it must be as it exists, like 
Plato's ideas, in the Divine Mind, and not as it was embodied in the 
Church of the poet's day.  It comes nearer the truth to say that she 
stands for the Spirit of the grace and wisdom and revelation of God, 
apart from all ecclesiastical forms -- that direct inspiration which 
Adam enjoyed in his unfallen state, and which, had that state 
continued, would have rendered the mediation of the Church unnecessary 
[^De Mon.~ iii. 4: `If man had remained in the state of innocence in 
which he was made by God he would have had no need of such directive 
regimens (as Church and Empire).  Such regimens, then, are remedial 
against the infirmity of sin.'  For a further discussion of this 
question, I may be allowed to refer to my exposition of the 
^Purgatorio~, ^Prisoners of Hope~ {see comm. to ^proemio~ of ^Purg.~
29}]. 

	|67-75.~  Turning then to Beatrice, and finding her absorbed in 
contemplation of `the eternal wheels,', Dante fixed his eyes upon 
her with so rapt a gaze that there was wrought within him the 
beginning of the great mysterious change and exaltation of the 
natural into the supernatural, by which man becomes `partaker of 
the Divine nature' [2 Peter i. 4]: 

     In her aspect such I inwardly became 
     As became Glaucus in the tasting of the herb, 
     That made him peer in the sea of the other gods. 
     To signify by words `transhumanize' 
     Impossible were: let the example then suffice 
     Him for whom grace the experience reserves. 
     If I was only that of me which Thou the last 
     Createdst, O Love that rulest heaven, 
     Thou knowest, who didst lift me with Thy light. 

[Plato in the ^Republic~ (x. 611) has a curious passage in which he uses
Glaucus for just the opposite purpose -- as a figure of the degradation
of the human soul in the ocean of this present world, in which her
condition `may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original
image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off
and crushed and in many ways damaged by the waves, and incrustations have
grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so that he is liker to
some sea-monster than to his natural form.'  In spite of the apparent
contrast, Plato's meaning is substantially the same as that of Dante, for
he proceeds to say that the soul must be `borne by a divine impulse' out
of this world-ocean, and freed from its incrustations and defilements,
before her true nature and beauty can be seen.]  Here Dante, after his
well-known custom, gives parallel examples, one from profane, the other
from holy writ.  Glaucus is the Boetian fisherman who ate of a herb sown
by Saturn, and was transformed into a sea-god.  The Scriptural example is
only hinted at: Dante was too humble to set his vision on a level with 
Paul's, though he applies to himself the Apostle's doubt: `whether in 
the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God 
knoweth' [2 Cor. xii. 2.  Comp. ^Inf.~ ii. 32, where Dante shrinks from 
the vision: 

     I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul, 
     Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it. 

When Dante says (ll. 73-75) he did not know whether he was only that 
which God created last, he means whether it was only his ^soul~ that 
ascended to Paradise.  According to the doctrine of Creationism, the 
soul is a direct creation by God; and it is created last -- after the 
body has reached a certain point in embryo (^Purg.~ xxv. 61-75)].  It 
would, of course, be folly to try to explain what Dante declares can be 
known only by experience; but there is a passage in the ^Dialogues~ of 
St. Gregory which attempts to put in words what he left folded up in 
`transhumanize': `All creatures be, as it were, nothing, to that soul 
which beholdeth the Creator: for though it see but a glimpse of that 
light which is in the Creator, yet very small do all things seem that 
be created: for by means of that supernatural light the capacity of the 
inward soul is enlarged, and is in God so extended that it is far above 
the world: yea and the soul of him that seeth in this manner is also 
above itself; for being rapt up in the light of God, it is inwardly in 
itself enlarged above itself; and when it is so exalted, and looketh 
downward, then doth it comprehend how little all that is which before 
in former baseness it could not comprehend' [^The Dialogues of St. 
Gregory the Great: An Old English Version~, p. 113].  

	|76-81.~  It is the beginning of this light which now breaks in a
flood of music upon the astonished soul: 

     When the wheel which Thou dost make eternal 
     Through desire for Thee, made me attentive to it, 
     By the harmony Thou dost blend and separate, 
     Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled 
     By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river 
     E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad. 

The sea of flame into which Dante has now entered is, in the 
literal sense, the Sphere of Fire, which according to the ideas 
of the time, was believed to encircle the earth immediately underneath 
the moon.  [The four elemental spheres -- in order downward from the 
moon, fire, air, water, earth -- were, as Dr. Moore says, `a 
continuation of the system of the ten heavens.'  `The way in which one 
element is enveloped by another is graphically compared by Bede to the 
constituent parts of an egg.  Earth is like the yolk in the centre, 
water surrounds it like the white of the egg; air corresponds with the 
membrane round the white; and fire with the shell that includes the 
whole (from Beazley, ^Dawn of Geography~, p. 371)' -- ^Studies in 
Dante~, 3rd series, p. 31.]  In the allegorical sense, it is the 
Divine light which is kindled only when the `transhumanized' soul is 
drawn by contemplation to the highest Heaven, the wheel which the 
desire for God makes eternal.  This wheel is the Empyrean, the Heaven 
of the Fire of Love, which, as explained in the Introduction, itself 
eternally at rest, moves all the other spheres with ceaseless longing 
for union with it.  Dante's meaning seems to be that this lower Sphere 
of Fire which he has now reached, is kindled by the fire of the 
Empyrean.  That which drew his mind so high was, he tells us, the 
harmony of the nine spheres which revolve between these two fiery 
confines -- the ^flammantia moenia mundi~, as it were, of Lucretius. 
Aristotle and Aquinas rejected the Platonic idea of the music of the 
spheres; but Dante, for symbolic reasons, prefers to follow a passage 
in Cicero's ^Vision of Scipio~: `The melody which you hear, and which, 
though composed in unequal time, is nevertheless divided into regular 
harmony, is effected by the motion and impulse of the spheres 
themselves, which, by a happy temper of sharp and grave notes, 
regularly produces various harmonic effects' [Edmonds' translation. 
Plato in the vision of Er (^Rep.~ x. 617) speaks of `the spindle of 
Necessity,' on which, as on an axis, the eight spheres of heaven 
revolve.  `The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the 
upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes round with them, 
hymning a single sound and note.  The eight together form one 
harmony.'  The idea, derived from Pythagoras, was expressly rejected by 
Aristotle (^De Coelo~, ii. 9) and Aquinas (on Job. xxxviii. 37 as in 
Vulg.)].  Probably Dante took the idea in its symbolic sense.  What he 
means to tell us is that it was his perception of the unity and balance 
of the nine spheres which led his mind up to the tenth -- each with its 
distinct note, and all blended together as in a harmony of sweet 
music.  It is obviously meant to stand in contrast to the sounds which 
greeted him on his entrance to the other two realms.  The wailings of 
the lost broke him down into tears.  On entering Purgatory Proper, the 
hoarse grating of the long-disused Gate mingled with the sweet music of 
the ^Te Deum laudamus.~  But here all discord is laid to rest: the 
harmony is, in Milton's words, 

     That undisturb@ed song of pure concent, 
     Aye sung before the sapphire-coloured throne 
     To him that sits thereon. 

	|82-95.~  Not knowing that he has left the earth, Dante is thrown 
into a great eagerness to learn the cause of the strange sound 
and light, and Beatrice rebukes him for his ignorance.  Had he 
shaken his soul free from the `false imagining' of the gross 
earth below, he would have known that he was now returning to the 
Sphere of Fire, the proper home of lightning, more swiftly than 
lightning flash ever left it [the Sphere of Fire was regarded as the 
source of the lightning, and indeed of all fire.  Hence fire is always 
rising, in an effort to regain its natural home.  `Fire cannot be 
trained to sink downwards' (Arist. ^Ethics~, ii. 1).  The idea occurs 
often in Dante, as in ^Par.~ i. 139-141; xxiii. 40-42; ^Conv.~ iii. 3] 
-- returning, because his soul is but going to the God from whom it 
came.  This error, however, is slight and natural, and therefore 
Beatrice takes the edge off her rebuke with a smile (l. 95). 

	|96-126.~  But Dante's next perplexity draws from her a sigh of pity
and a look such as a mother casts on a delirious child.  He is in amaze
how he `transcends these light bodies,' the spheres of air and fire
through which he is passing.  The question shows Beatrice that he does
not yet understand the fundamental doctrine of the order of the universe;
and not to understand it is a species of delirium.  As this, therefore, 
lies at the root of all that earth and heaven are, Beatrice begins with 
it her first great theological discourse.  The passage is important: 

               `All things whate'er they be 
     Have order among themselves, and this is ^form~, 
     Which makes the universe resemble God. 
     Here do the high creatures see the footprints 
     Of the Eternal Goodness, which is the end 
     Whereto the law aforesaid has been made. 
     In the order that I speak of are inclined 
     All natures, by their destinies diverse, 
     More or less near unto their origin; 
     Hence they move onward unto ports diverse, 
     O'er the great sea of being; and each one 
     With instinct given it which bears it on. 
     This bears away the fire towards the moon; 
     This is in mortal hearts the motive power; 
     This binds together and unites the earth. 
     Nor only the created things that are 
     Without intelligence this bow shoots forth, 
     But those that have both intellect and love. 
     The Providence that regulates all this 
     Makes with its light the heaven for ever quiet, 
     Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste; 
     And thither now, as to a site decreed, 
     Bears us away the virtue of that cord 
     Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.' 
          [(Longfellow's transl. slightly altered).] 

In these few lines Beatrice has condensed the substance 
of many passages of Aquinas.  The scholastic word |form~ in l. 
104 means the `idea' or pattern existing in the Divine mind, 
according to which each created thing receives its essence or 
substantial being.  But there is a `form' or Divine idea not 
merely for each separate thing, but for the universe as a 
whole; and this `form' or Divine idea is the mutual order by 
which the several parts are so bound together that they 
constitute an organic unity.  It is this mutual order, impressed 
by the Divine idea on the totality of created things, which makes 
the universe a similitude of God.  `Since the world,' says 
Aquinas, `was not made by chance, but was made by God by the 
agency of intellect, it is necessary there be in the Divine mind 
^form~, in the similitude of which the world was made' [^Summa~, i. q. 
xv. a. 1.  The word ^form~ has so changed its meaning that it is almost 
impossible to make its scholastic sense clear to our modern minds.  We 
speak of a thing as being `a ^formality~,' `a ^formal~ thing,' `a mere 
matter of ^form~,' meaning a thing of no great importance.  To the 
scholastics ^form~ was of the last importance -- it meant, as one writer 
says, `the ^last complement of reality~, the ^final determination~, or 
^complete realization of being.~'  Perhaps it will help us to 
understand this and some other things if we borrow this author's 
illustration of Aristotle's four kinds of causes by means of a statue. 
`The ^material~ principle is the iron, bronze, or stone -- the stuff 
out of which the particular statue is wrought.  The ^formal~ principle 
is the determining figure or shape, by which the statue is made to 
represent Napoleon or Nelson.  The ^efficient~ cause is the sculptor, 
his hammer, chisel, etc.  The ^final~ cause is the satisfaction, fame, 
or money which the artist has in view in the production of the work' 
(Father Maher's ^Psychology~, 555-560)].  So close is this similitude 
that elsewhere he argues confidently from the unity of the world to the 
unity of its Maker.  And not His unity alone, but His Eternal Goodness 
(^eterno valore~, l. 107), the end for which this law of order has 
been impressed on the universe.  For, by the very inequalities of 
things `God has communicated His goodness in such a way that one 
creature can transmit to others the good which it has received.  To 
take away order from creation is to take away the best thing that there 
is in creation: for while individual things in themselves are good, the 
conjunction of them all is best by reason of the order in the universe: 
for the whole is ever better than the parts and is the end of the 
parts' [^Contra Gentiles~, iii. 69 (Father Rickaby's transl.)].  Men 
and Angels -- `the high creatures' of l. 106 -- trace in this order the 
footsteps of that Eternal Goodness which is its final end. 

For the preservation of this order and the attaining of 
the unity and goodness which are the similitude of God, Beatrice 
continues, their Maker has infused into all creatures an 
inclination or instinct which impels them to seek for some good, 
in various ways, according to the greater or less nearness of 
their natures to the Source of their being.  `Since all things 
proceed from the Divine will, all things in their own way are 
inclined by appetite toward good, but the ways vary.  For some 
are inclined to a good by natural disposition alone, without 
knowledge, as plants and inanimate bodies; and such an 
inclination is called ^natural~ appetite.  But some are inclined 
to a good with a certain amount of knowledge; not so, however, 
that they know the rational ground of good, but that they know 
some particular good: as the sense knows sweet and white, and 
things of this kind.  Inclination then which follows this sort of 
knowledge is called ^sensitive~ appetite.  But some are inclined 
to good with a knowledge by which they recognized the rational 
conception of good itself, which is the property of the 
^intellect.~  And these are inclined to the good in the most 
perfect way; not as if merely directed to the good by another, 
like the things that lack knowledge; nor to a particular good 
only, as those in which sensitive knowledge alone exists, but as 
if inclined to universal good itself; and this inclination is 
called ^will~' [^Summa~, i. q. lix. a. 1].  In the present passage 
Beatrice gives examples of each of these three classes.  (1) The mere 
^natural~ appetite `bears the fire toward the moon': that is, the fire, 
by the unconscious law of its nature impressed on it by God from 
without, rises in the direction of the sphere of fire to which it 
belongs.  The same natural appetite -- the law of gravitation -- `binds 
together and unites the earth.'  (2) The ^sensitive~ appetite is `the 
motive power in mortal hearts' -- that is, the lower animals, moved by 
mere instinct [Butler is certainly wrong in translating ^nei cuor 
mortali~ `in the hearts of men.'  The next ^terzina~ shows clearly that 
Dante is here thinking of `creatures that are without intelligence.' 
In the ^Conv.~ (ii. 9) he says `many things that live are entirely 
mortal, such as the brute animals,' but this, he holds, separates them 
from men, who have the hope of immortality].  (3) The ^rational~ 
appetite is that which inclines `those that have both intellect and 
love' -- men and Angels, who can rise to the conception of a universal 
good. 

	|127-135.~  It is just in this last {the rational appetite},
Beatrice admits, that a flaw in the order of the universe may arise --
the matter may be `deaf to respond' to `the intention of the art.' 
Intellect and love imply will, and will has power to swerve aside to a
`false pleasure.'  The nearer to God any nature is, the greater is its
power of self-determination: the stone has no option, the man has a wide
range of choice.  In one thing, indeed, neither man nor Angel has any
choice: they have by the very constitution of their nature the general
conception of the good -- the universal ^bonum~ -- which they cannot but
seek.  Their freedom is that the will has power to direct itself to this
particular object or that, which may seem to partake of the universal
good, and thus the possibility of error arises: `false pleasures' may
persuade the soul to rest in some good lower than the highest, or even in
some evil which presents itself as good.  When this happens, `the clay is
marred in the hand of the potter' [Jer. xviii. 4.  In ^Conv.~ iv. 12, the
soul is compared to a pilgrim on the pathway of this life, never before 
travelled by it, and therefore mistaking every house it sees for its 
true inn, on its way home to the God from whom it came.  The conception 
of the universal good with which it is born impels it onward, but its 
inexperience leads it into the error of identifying that highest good 
with this trivial object and that]. 

	|136-142.~  Dante, however, is now in no danger of thus breaking the
Divine order of the universe.  His will is `free, upright and 
sane' {^Purg.~ 27.40} ; `false pleasures' {^Purg.~ 31.35} have lost their
power; his long climb out of sin, the stern discipline of Terrace after
Terrace, the draughts of Lethe and Euno,e by which the memory of sin
vanished and that of good revived -- all had left him `pure and disposed 
to mount unto the stars' {^Purg.~ 33.145}.  And therefore Beatrice tells
him they are now flying up to the heaven of peace, as to their appointed 
site, borne by the bowstring of the Divine will, which never shoots, save
at `a joyful mark.'  Freed from the weight and impediment of sin, it was
as natural for him to rise as for a torrent to fall down a lofty
mountain; and it had been as marvellous a thing for him to settle down
below, as for fire to remain quiet on the earth and refuse to ascend to
its native sphere.  And then Beatrice fulfils her own teaching: 

     Thereon toward heaven she turned back her face.
