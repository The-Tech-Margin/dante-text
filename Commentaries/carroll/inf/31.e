	|Proemio.~  As we are now about to enter the Ninth and
last Circle, the prison of Traitors, it may be well to remind
ourselves of the general plan and structure of this nether Hell. 
We saw that the three lowest Circles are, so to speak, the
underground dungeons of the City of Dis.  From the centre of the
City a broken precipice leads down to the Circle of Violence; and
thence a vast chasm falls to Malebolge, that of Fraud.  We have
just seen that this Circle consists of ten concentric Moats, all
sloping centreward like the tiers of a vast amphitheatre.  The
centre itself -- or, holding by the figure of the amphitheatre,
the arena -- is a flat plain, thought by some to be about
three-quarters of a mile in breadth.  In the middle is sunk an
enormous well, -- one vast final swamp into which drain all the
infernal rivers, Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, which then form
the great frozen lake, or rather cesspool, of Cocytus.  It is
toward this `bottom of all guilt' that the travellers are now
about to make their way. 

	|7-45.~  Turning their backs on the last and lowest dyke
of Malebolge, they strike straight across the plain in silence,
Dante still feeling the shame of Virgil's rebuke.  They had not
gone far when the blast of a horn, so loud it made any thunder
faint, startled Dante and caused him to strain his eyes in the
direction from which it seemed to come.  Through the dim air,
`less than night and less than day,' he soon saw what he took to
be the towers of a town, like those which ring round the castle
of Montereggioni near Siena.  Virgil, however, corrects the error
into which the distance and darkness betrayed him: the `towers'
are a range of Giants standing half-sunk in the great well of the
next Circle, and what he sees is the upper half of their bodies.

	|46-48.~  The blast of the horn, louder than that blown
by Orlando at Roncesvalles, came from Nimrod, the `mighty hunter
before the Lord,' whom Dante, probably on St. Augustine's
authority, regards as one of the giants of Scriptural tradition. 

	|49-57.~  As he looks at him, Dante is thankful that
Nature has abandoned the creation of such `executors' of Mars:
although she continues to produce gigantic animals like elephants
and whales, she has rendered them comparatively harmless by
withholding the gift of intellect.

	|58-66.~  His face was as large and long as `the
pine-cone of St. Peter's,' a huge bronze cone which originally
formed the apex of the Mausoleum of Hadrian or Castle of St.
Angelo, but now in the gardens of the Vatican.  Toynbee gives its
height as seven and a half feet.  The part of Nimrod's body
visible above the edge of the well was so huge that three
Frieslanders, says Dante, could not have reached up to his hair,
that is, to his neck.  From these data, his height has been
variously calculated from fifty-five to seventy feet. 

	|67.~  When Nimrod caught sight of the pilgrims, he
greeted them with a clamorous cry:

     `Rafel mai amech zabi almi,'

of which many interpretations have been attempted.  None,
however, ought to be sought for, since Dante plainly intends it as
the sign of the confusion of tongues which Nimrod was believed to
have created at Babel.  It is in allusion to the building of this
Tower that Dante compares the Giants to the towers which rival
families and clans had built in every city of Italy; he saw in
these towers the same spirit of pride which produced the Tower of
Babel and all the subsequent confusion. 

	|76-81.~  It is for this reason too that Virgil calls
Nimrod `confused soul' {v. 74}, and bids him vent his
inarticulate passion through his horn.  As he says to Dante:

                      `Himself he doth accuse;
     This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
     One language in the world is not still used.
     Let us leave him standing, and not speak in vain:
     For even such to him is every language
     As his to others, which to none is known.

This question of language had a peculiar interest for Dante, and
led to some curious speculations.  In his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~
(i. 6, 7) he says that the original language was Hebrew, and that
this language was preserved by the Shemites only because they
took no part in the building of the Tower of Babel.  When God
sent confusion of tongues on the impious builders, `the same
language remained to those alone who were engaged in the same
kind of work: for instance, one (language) to all the architects;
another to those rolling down blocks of stone, another to those
preparing the stone; and so it happened to each group of workers. 
And the human race was accordingly divided into as many different
languages as there were different branches of the work; and the
higher the branch of work the men were engaged in, the ruder and
more barbarous was the language they afterwards spoke.'  The
original tongue remained with the Shemites `in order that our
Redeemer (who was, as to His humanity, to spring from them) might
use, not the language of confusion, but of grace.'  This opinion,
however, Dante retracted in ^Par.~ XXVI. 124, where Adam tells
him that the language he spoke was `all quenched' long before the
Tower of Babel was begun.

	|84-90.~  Turning to the left, they found, a bowshot off,
Ephialtes, one of the Giants of heathen mythology, who piled Ossa
on Olympus, and Pelion on Ossa, to scale heaven and dethrone
Jove.  The arms with which once he `terrified the gods' are now
bound with chains, the right behind his back, the left in front;
yet all manacled as he was, when he shook himself as an
earthquake shakes a tower, Dante would have died for fear had he
not seen his chains. 

	|97-105.~  He was anxious to see Briareus of the hundred
hands; but Virgil replies that he is too far off, and that he is
bound like Ephialtes, only more ferocious in his aspect. 

	|110-123.~  Meantime it was necessary to hasten to
Antaeus.  This Giant had taken no part in the war against the
gods, and was therefore left unbound.  He was the least ferocious
of the Giants, as Chiron was of the Centaurs, and Virgil hoped to
persuade him to lift them down from the plain to the ice of
Cocytus far below.  He did not scruple to flatter his pride by
recalling his prowess in slaying a thousand lions in the valley
of the Bagrada, where Scipio Africanus won glory by his great
victory over Hannibal, and by suggesting that the war with the
gods would have gone differently had he joined in it. 

	|126-145.~  Even under this praise, Antaeus `curled his
lip' in scorn, and only gave way when Virgil promised that Dante
would `restore his fame' in the upper world.  The `hands whose
great grasp Hercules once felt' laid hold of Virgil; Virgil in
turn laid hold of Dante, making of the two `one bundle'; and then
the giant form, stooping as Carisenda, the leaning tower of
Bologna, seems to stoop when a light cloud passes over it, set
them on the ice far beneath his feet, and rose again like `the
mast of some great ammiral.'

	|General Note.~  The Giants are set here as Guardians of
this `bottom of all guilt,' for two reasons.  First, they are
symbols of that pride which cannot brook the sovereignty of God. 
It is the Circle of Traitors, the infernal palace, so to speak,
of Lucifer, `the Emperor of the dolorous realm,' who sits on his
throne of pain far within, while they guard the doors.  `In the
same way as the heavenly choirs of angels surround the throne of
God, so here the giants close in round their chief, Lucifer, as
though they were his body-guard.'  As he sought to overthrow God
in Heaven, so had they fought against Him from the earth; and in
him and them alike, the source and fountain of their treachery
was pride.  This is plain from the next division of the poem. 
When Dante reaches the First Terrace of Purgatory on which the
sin of Pride is expiated, he finds carved upon its marble
pavement examples of this sin, and among them Lucifer like
lightning falling from Heaven, Briareus transfixed with the
thunderbolt, the limbs of the Giants scattered on the earth, and
Nimrod at the foot of his Tower gazing bewildered at `the people
who were proud with him in Shinar' [^Purg.~ xii. 25-36.  Pride is
not elsewhere referred to in the ^Inferno.~  It is the lowest sin
in Hell; in the ^Purgatorio it is also lowest -- till Pride is
conquered on the First Terrace, no other sin can be purged out of
human nature].  The second reason for their being set here is
undoubtedly to indicate the enormity of the sin of this `lowest
pool of the universe.'  `Treachery is a gigantic version of
fraud, by which "is forgotten that love which Nature makes, and
also that which afterwards is added, giving birth to special
trust" (^Inf.~ XI. 61-63); hence the guardians of this circle are
monstrosities in magnified human shape' [Edmund G. Gardner's
^Dante~, p. 99].

	Another symbol of the greatness of the sin is the depth
of this well of Cocytus.  Just as Geryon had to bear the
travellers down the great precipice between Violence and Fraud,
so Antaeus has to lift them far down to the still lower deep
that exists in Fraud itself.
