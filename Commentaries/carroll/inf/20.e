	|Proemio.~  When Virgil had carried Dante out of the
valley of the Simoniacs, he laid him down on the summit of the
arch of the next bridge, a rugged cliff so steep that even `for
the goats it would be hard passage.'  The reference is probably
to the difficulty and danger of climbing safely across the sin
punished in the fourth Moat of Malebolge.  It is Divination, a
sin which not infrequently attacks men of intellect.  It is more
than possible that Dante himself may have felt its fascination,
and, but for the protecting arms of Reason, might have stumbled
and fallen into its abyss.  The sure step of Virgil on this steep
ridge has, however, a special significance.  We must remember
that the popular legends of the Middle Ages had transformed the
great Latin poet into a diviner and enchanter [see Comparetti's
^Virgil in the Middle Ages~], and, of course, had Dante accepted
this view he must have set Virgil in this very Moat.  He did,
indeed, regard him as a diviner in the true sense -- a prophet
outside of Israel, who foresaw the advent of the Christ.  It was
necessary, therefore, to vindicate Virgil against the popular
conception of him; and this he does by showing the ease with
which he mounts this steep arch which spans the sin of
Divination, where even a goat would find it hard to make its way.

	|4-15.~  Gazing down into the valley, Dante sees a
procession of souls pacing slowly as when the Litany is sung, and
all weeping silently.  The silence may be, as some think, part of
the punishment, in contrast to the charms and incantations which
they used to mutter on earth; and the slow pacing may refer to
the solemn mystic movements with which they once performed the
ritual of the unholy arts.  The chief penalty, however, is that
their heads are reversed, and they can see and walk no way but
backward.  Divination is an impious attempt to see into the
future; and now `to look forward has been taken from them.'

	Turning now to the punishment, it is obvious that it is
taken from ^Isaiah~, xliv. 24-25, `I am the Lord, that maketh all
things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth
abroad the earth; who is with me?  That frustrateth the tokens of
the liars, and ^maketh diviners mad~; ^that turneth wise men
backward~, and maketh their knowledge foolish.'  The punishment
is entirely natural; men who pry into the future get their heads
turned, and lose the power of seeing even the present.  Take, for
instance, that comparatively harmless form of divination which
survives among ourselves -- the foretelling from the apocalyptic
books of Scripture of the course of the future history of the
world till the day of judgment: is it not the simple truth that
this prying into the future turns men's heads and blinds them to
the signs and movements of the present moment?  A similar turning
of wise men backward and making of their knowledge foolish is
seen in modern spiritualism, which consists of prying into the
secrets of another world.  It is, of course, impossible to say
that there can be no communication between world and world, or
that `no traveller returns'; but one of the penalties of this
constant peeping through the keyhole of the future world is
undoubtedly that men have their heads turned, and grow unfitted
for dealing sanely with the affairs and business of the world in
which God has set them.  It is the penalty He has appointed for
any irreverent attempt to tear aside the veil which He has
mercifully drawn between man and the future and invisible.

	|19-30.~  To Dante it is punishment so terrible that,
when he sees the distorted forms and the tears of the sufferers
falling down their backs, he weeps in sympathy with them:

     Truly I wept leaning on one of the rocks
     Of the hard crag.

Although he appeals to the reader to think how it was possible
for him to keep his face dry at such a sight, Virgil gives him a
very stern rebuke:

        `Art thou too of the other fools?
     Here pity lives when it is wholly dead.
     Who is a greater reprobate than he
     Who bears compassion at the doom divine?'

`Art thou too of the other fools?' -- that is, the fools in this
Moat, the Diviners, who are also weeping.  It is to be noted that
in Italian ^piet@a~ has the double meaning of ^pity~ and ^piety~,
and Dante has both in view.  To retain the two Plumptre
translates line 28:

     `Here piety lives when pity's self hath died.'

     [There is the same double meaning in ^Par.~ iv. 105, where of
     Alcmaeon it is said that `not to lose piety (^piet@a~) he became
     pitiless (^spietato~).'  The piety consisted in obeying the
     command of his father, Amphiar,aus, to slay his mother; the
     pitilessness was his putting of her to death.  In ^Conv.~ iv. 21,
     Dante names ^piet@a~ as one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit;
     and in ii. 11, he says it is `not a passion, but rather a noble
     disposition of the mind, prepared to receive love, mercy, and
     other charitable passions.']

In other words, it is a great impiety to impugn by our pity the
justice of God's judgments upon sinners.  Longfellow quotes Omar
Khayy$am to the same effect:

     `O thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn
     In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn,
       How long be crying, "Mercy on them, God!"
     Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?'

Thomas Aquinas teaches that the saints rejoice in the sufferings
of the lost, as discerning in them the justice of God: `A thing
can be in joy in two ways: (1) For itself (^per se~), when one
rejoices in the thing as such, and in this way the saints do
^not~ rejoice in the sufferings of the wicked; (2) Indirectly
(^per accidens~), on account of something else joined to it; thus
the saints will rejoice in the sufferings of the wicked,
considering in them the order of divine justice' [^Summa~, Supp.
q. xciv. a. 3].

	Nevertheless the sharpness of Virgil's rebuke cannot but
surprise us.  On several occasions, as we have seen, he had
allowed Dante's pity, or even approved of it, as in the case of
the Violent against Nature; why, then, has it become an impiety
now?  One reason has been already referred to.  In the Middle
Ages Virgil had the reputation of being a diviner himself; and
the very severity of his rebuke is Dante's way of clearing him of
this dark fame by showing how sternly he judged this sin.  But
undoubtedly the deepest reason lies in the nature of the sin
itself.  It is a sin almost incomprehensible to the modern mind;
we smile away wizardry and witchcraft, astrology and
fortune-telling, as harmless superstitions.  The theology of the
Middle Ages, however, following Scripture, took a much more
serious view of it.  Aquinas, for example, discusses the
question, Is Divination a sin?  -- Divination being defined as
`some sort of prediction of things to come.'  His answer is that
things which happen by necessary and invariable causes, such as
eclipses, can be predicted without sin.  So also can those things
which happen, `not necessarily and invariably, but generally,
failing however at times,' such as rain or drought.  But there is
a third class of things which are `indeterminate, and may work
either way,' and these God alone can foreknow, and therefore to
^divine~ them is an infringement of His prerogative.  `To
consider such effects in themselves before they take place, is
proper to God, who alone in His eternity sees future things as
present.  Hence it is said: "Show the things that are to come
hereafter, and we shall know that ye are gods" (Isa. xli. 23). 
If any one therefore presumes to foretell or foreknow future
things of this character, otherwise than by God's revealing them
to him, he manifestly usurps to himself the prerogative of God;
and from this some are called ^diviners.~  Hence Isidore says:
"Diviners are so called as being full of God: for they pretend to
be full of the Divinity, and with fraudulent cunning they
conjecture what is to befall man in the future."  It is not
therefore called ^divination~, if one foretells things which
happen of necessity, or happen generally, which things can be
foreknown by human reason; or if one knows by revelation of God
other events which are to happen though not of necessity, in the
future: for then he is not himself ^divining~, that is, doing
what is divine, rather he is receiving what is divine.  But then
only is a man said to ^divine~, when he arrogates to himself in
an undue manner the foretelling of future events; and this is
certaintly a sin' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xcv. a. 1].  It is probably
for this reason that Diviners are set lower than even Simoniacs. 
Simony is, indeed, a trafficking in the Spirit of God, but
Divination is, as it were, a pretence of actually ^being~ the
Spirit, a bold usurpation of the attributes of God and exercise
of His prerogative.  It was a fraud, therefore, practised upon
the spiritual nature of men: it robbed them of the true God and
of the trust for their future which they ought to place in Him. 
For manifestly it is a spiritual impossibility for a man who
relies on a diviner to rely also upon God.  The very attempt to
unveil the future is an effort to free oneself from the necessity
of leaning on the Divine providence and care, an impious attempt
to make oneself independent of them.  This is the reason for the
sharpness of Virgil's rebuke of Dante's pity; it is also the
reason for that peculiar severity against every form of
Divination which perplexes us in Scripture.  In ages of
superstition, when Divination abounds, it is almost, if not
quite, impossible for men either to form any worthy conception of
God or to repose any trust in His providence.  It is, therefore,
neither right nor reasonable to waste tears on men who practice
on their fellows so heartless a deception of their highest
spiritual instincts.

	|31-39.~  Virgil points out and names eight souls: five
from his own world of antiquity, and three from near Dante's
time.  First of the ancients comes Amphiaraus, the great hero and
seer of Argos, and, like Capaneus, one of the Seven against
Thebes.  Foreseeing his own death in this war, he hid himself;
but his wife Eriphyle, bribed by Polynices with the fatal
necklace of Harmonia, revealed the place of his concealment.  The
ending of the ancient story is very different from that of
Dante's version.  According to the classical legend, at the
moment when Amphiar,aus was about to be struck by a spear, Zeus
saved him by opening the earth with his thunderbolt to swallow
him together with his horses and chariot.  Immediately he became
a god in the popular mind, was worshipped in many places, and
consulted as an oracle.  All this is reversed by Dante.  The
Thebans when they see him sink into the earth cry after him:

               `"Whither rushest thou,
     Amphiar,aus?  Why dost leave the war?"' --

a taunt for his former concealment of himself.  Instead of rising
again to divine honours as an oracle, Dante represents him as
continuing his headlong rush into the earth as far as Minos, the
judge of every sinner.  While in the world above men build
temples to him and consult him as a god who knows the future,
here below he walks his weary backward path, with his head
reversed, and eyes that see no way but behind.

     `Because he wished to see too far before him
     Behind he looks, and backward makes his way'

	|40-45.~  After him paces Tiresias, the blind soothsayer
of Thebes, who foretold the victory of the city in its war with
the Seven Kings.  Ovid tells the story of his transformations to
which Dante refers [^Metam.~ iii. 323-331].  Having separated
two serpents which he found intertwined in a wood, he was changed
into a woman; at the end of seven years he found the same
serpents intertwined once more, struck them with his rod a second
time, and was changed back into a man.  In his case too the
classical myth is reversed.  Homer represents him as the only
soul in Hades who retains his intellect unimpaired; he still
carries his soothsayer's golden staff, and foretells to Odysseus
the course of his future wanderings.  But Dante strips him of all
this: so far from foreseeing the future, he cannot now see even
the present [^Odyssey~, x. 495; xi. 90-151].

	|46-51.~  The third Diviner is Aruns, the Etruscan, who
foretold the issue of the war between Caesar and Pompey.  He lived
in a cave of the white marbles of Carrara, from which he could
behold without obstruction the stars and sea, a reference perhaps
to his practice of astrology.

	|52-102.~  Next comes Manto, the daughter of Tiresias,
her long hair falling down her breast instead of her shoulders. 
Virgil's native city, Mantua [strictly the village of Andes, near
Mantua, identified with the modern village of Pietole; see
^Purg.~ xviii. 82, 83], was believed to have received its name
from the Theban prophetess, and he takes the opportunity of
explaining to Dante at considerable length how she became its
founder.  Starting with Lake Benacus, now Lago di Garda, he
traces the river Mincio as it flows out of the south end of the
lake at the great fortress of Peschiera, and soon afterwards
spreads out into the unhealthy marsh which surrounds Mantua.  To
this marsh, then destitute of inhabitants, came `the cruel
virgin,' Manto, in the course of her wide wanderings after the
death of her father and the enslavement of Thebes, `the city of
Bacchus.'  Here, to shun all human intercourse, she and her
servants remained for the practice of her arts.  After her death,
the men scattered around gathered themselves together to the
place, partly for the protection of the marsh:

     `They built the city over those dead bones,
     And after her who first the place selected,
     Mantua named it, without other omen.'

Virgil attaches great importance to this account of the founding
of his native city, for he charges Dante that if he hears any
other origin he is to give this, the true one.  The curious thing
is that Virgil himself gives a different account.  In the ^AEneid~
(x. 198-200) the founding of the city is attributed to Ocnus, son
of the river Tiber and the prophetess Manto, who gave it his
mother's name.  From the pointedness of his words, it is evident
that Dante wished to correct the Virgilian legend, but his reason
for laying such emphasis on the correction is unknown.  Another
curious difficulty is connected with Manto.  In the ^Purgatorio~
(xxii. 109-114) Virgil in his conversation with the poet Statius
tells him that he saw in Limbo several of his people, that is,
the characters in this ^Thebaid~ and ^Achilleid~ -- among the
rest `the daughter of Tiresias.'  It is difficult to think that
this is any other than the Manto here; and it is even more
difficult to suppose that after writing this long passage about
her, he could entirely forget it, and set her in a totally
different part of the Inferno.  If there is a slip of memory, the
passage before us must have been written after the incidental
reference in the ^Purgatorio~ [`This is an unique instance of
inaccuracy on D.'s part in a matter of this kind; the only
explanation seems to be that he has in some way confused Manto,
daughter of Tiresias, with Manto, daughter of Hercules'
(Toynbee)].

	|106-114.~  The fifth and last of the ancient seers is
Eurypylus.  Here again, according to the commentators, Dante
seems to nod.  Virgil says that Eurypylus was associated with the
prophet Calchas in the giving of the signal for the sailing of
the Greek fleet from Aulis against Troy, adding,

              `And thus sings him
     My lofty Tragedy in some place or other:
     Well knowest it thou, who knowest it all.'

When we turn to the ^AEneid~, we find him mentioned with Calchas,
not in connection with the sailing of the Greeks for Troy, but
with their departure from it when the war was over, or rather
when they had grown wearied and discouraged with the length of
it.  Driven back time after time by storms, they sent Eurypylus
to consult to oracle of Apollo; and he brought back the answer
that as they had sailed from Aulis through the sacrifice of a
Grecian life, by a like sacrifice they must now return.  It is
curious if Dante really makes a slip at the very moment when he
is priding himself on his perfect knowledge of his Virgil. 
Fortunately, so far as we can see, nothing important in the moral
interpretation of the passage turns on either of the alleged
mistakes [^AEn.~ ii. 108-129].

	|115-120.~  We come now to the Diviners of more modern
times.  Three are specially named:

     `That other who is so slender in the flanks
     Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
     Of magic frauds did know the game.
     Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
     Who now unto his leather and his thread
     Would fain have stuck, but too late repents.'

Asdente (^i.e.~ toothless) was the nickname of a shoemaker of
Parma who lived in the thirteenth century, and is said to have
foretold the defeat of Frederick II. in his siege of that city in
1248.  He seems to have been widely known and talked of in his
day, for in the ^Convito~ Dante says that if notoriety
constituted nobility `Asdente, the cobbler of Parma, would be
more noble than any of his fellow-citizens' [^Conv.~ iv. 16]. 
Now, when it is too late he wishes he had stuck to his last and
let the art of divination alone.  His companion, Guido Bonatti,
was astrologer to the great Ghibelline captain, Count Guido of
Montefeltro, whom we shall find in the eighth Moat of this
Circle.  The story is that his master lost faith in him because a
peasant foretold the weather more truly than he, whereupon
Bonatti died of grief [Villani (vii. 81) in his account of the
defeat of the French by Count Guido at the siege of Forl@i in
1282, writes: `It is said that this same Count of Montefeltro was
guided by the augury and counsel of one Guido Bonatti, a
roof-maker, who had turned astrologer or the like, and that it
was he who prompted his actions; and for this emprise he gave him
the standard and said, "Thou hast it at such a pitch, that so
long as a rag of it holds, wheresoever thou bearest it thou shalt
be victorious."  But I more believe that his victories were won
by his own wit and mastery of war'].

	By far the most famous of the three, however, is the
first-named, Michael Scott of Balwearie, in Fifeshire,

     `A wizard of such dreaded fame,
     That when, in Salamanca's cave,
     Him listed his magic wand to wave,
     The bells would ring in Notre Dame!'

Although claimed by Salerno and Toledo, there seems little doubt
that he was a native of Scotland, where the legends of his
exploits still linger, or did in Sir Walter Scott's time: `In the
South of Scotland,' he says, `any work of great labour and
antiquity is ascribed either to the agency of ^Auld Michael~, of
Sir William Wallace, or of the devil' [^Lay of the Last
Minstrel~, Canto ii. and note].  He lived in the thirteenth
century, and was undoubtedly a man of great learning, having
studied at Oxford, Paris, and Toledo.  At Paris, according to
some accounts, he took his degree of doctor of theology.  At
Toledo he learned Arabic, and thus became acquainted with the
numerous translations of Aristotle and commentaries on his works
in that language.  In Germany he met the Emperor Frederick II.,
who attached him to his Court, and commissioned him to
superintend a translation of Aristotle into Latin.  He was the
author of numerous works on astrology, alchemy, and the occult
sciences.  Dante seems to refer to his emaciation through severe
study, when he says he was `so slender in the flanks'; but it is
possible that the allusion is to his supposed power of making
himself invisible at will.  He is said to have foretold the death
of Frederick and to have foreseen his own.  According to some
accounts he died in Sicily soon after his master; but the usual
view is that he returned to his native country, where he died in
1250, or thereabout.  `Tradition,' say Sir Walter, `varies
concerning the place of burial: some contend for Holme Coltrame
in Cumberland, others for Melrose Abbey; but all agree that his
books of magic were interred in his grave, or preserved in the
convent where he died.'

	|121-123.~  After these Virgil points out hurriedly a
troop of witches:

     `See the wretched women who left the needle,
     The shuttle, and the spindle, and made them divineresses;
     They wrought their sorcery with herb and image.'

	`Herb' refers to love-philtres; and there can be no
doubt, as Plumptre says, that `practically such women carried on
a direct trade in poisoning.'  The `image' refers to the
well-known superstition that a person can be killed by making a
waxen effigy of him and sticking pins into it, or holding it to
the fire till it melts away. 

	|124-127.~  Virgil hurries Dante on after a mere glance,
for already `Cain and the thorns' [with reference to the popular
superstition that Cain is `the Man in the Moon'; according to
some forms of the story, the thorns are those with which he
strove in vain to hide the body of his murdered brother; and the
wandering moon may be regarded as the land of Nod (Wandering)
into which he was banished (comp. ^Mids. Night's Dream~, iii. 1;
v. 1; Leland's ^Legends of Florence~, first series, p. 254)]
stands on the horizon and `touches the wave beneath Seville': in
other words, the moon is setting in the west some time between
six and seven on the Saturday morning, the day after they began
the pilgrimage.  It is sunrise, but the sun being the sensible
image of God [^Conv.~ iii. 12] is too sacred to be named in this
lost world of darkness and eternal night.  All indications of
time, even during the day, are given be means of the moon.
