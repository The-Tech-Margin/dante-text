	|4-15.~  We have passed through two of the three concentric
Rings or Belts which form the Circle of Violence: the River of
Blood in which are plunged the Violent against their Neighbours,
and the dark Forest, the trees of which are the souls of Suicides,
the Violent against Themselves.  We now reach the central Ring, in 
which are punished the Violent against God, Nature, and Art. 
When the travellers come to the inner edge of the Forest, they 
see a vast Plain of Sand, as dry and thick, says Dante, as the 
Libyan desert across which Cato of Utica made his terrible march 
of six days with the remnant of Pompey's army, after the battle 
of Pharsalia in 48 B.C.  As the River of Blood and the Forest of 
Suicides are typical of the sins there punished, so this dry 
barren Sand-Waste is symbolic of the lives of the Violent against 
God and His offspring, Nature and Art; such Violence turns human 
life into a desert `which rejecteth every plant.' 

	|19-27.~  On this barren plain Dante saw `a horrible act of
justice': a rain of `dilated flakes of fire' was falling on it,
silently and steadily, `like snow among the Alps upon a windless
day,' and as it fell the dry sandy soil broke into flame like
tinder, `for doubling of the pain.'  Under this rain of fire,
pitiless, persistent, inevitable, herds of naked weeping souls
suffered their eternal doom, according to their special form of the
sin.  Blasphemers against God lay stretched upon the burning ground
with faces upturned to the fiery storm which the Heaven they had
defied now poured down upon them.  Sodomites, the Violent against
Nature, driven by their own unnatural passions, ran about
perpetually, not daring to rest for fear of greater pain.  Usurers,
the Violent against Art, were sitting crouched up, with eyes bent 
upon the sand, the symbol of their own barren, unproductive 
lives.  The only alleviation allowed is what Dante calls `the 
dance of miserable hands,' flinging off, `now here, now there,' 
the fresh fire-flakes as they fall. 

	|44-66.~  To the man himself it may seem an act of magnificent
and almost superhuman courage, when he stands up before high Heaven
and lifts his face in blasphemy against his Maker; but, in nine
cases out of ten, it is not courage but bravado.  The moment the
Power he has defied casts him to the ground and storms over him,
the thin veil of bravado is swept away and the coward beneath
screams aloud in his terror.  It is perhaps for this reason that
Dante passes all the others, and singles out for notice one soul
who is no coward.  As they are skirting the edge of the Forest of 
Suicides to avoid the fiery rain, Dante asks Virgil, 
 
     `Who is that great one who seems not to heed 
     The fire, and lies disdainful and contorted, 
     So that the rain seems not to ripen him?' 
                              [^Inf.~ xiv. 46-48.] 
 
Before Virgil can reply, this disdainful soul, perceiving that 
they are speaking of him, answers for himself, `What I was 
living, that am I dead!'  It is Capaneus, one of the seven kings 
who besieged Thebes.  Having blasphemously challenged the gods to 
come to the rescue of the city, Jupiter struck him with a 
thunderbolt as he was scaling the walls.  So indomitable was his 
spirit that even then he refused to fall, but remained leaning 
against the walls of the city till he died.  Now, indeed, he can 
stand no longer, the storm of fire beats him to the ground and 
keeps him there; but it cannot break his spirit, or wring from 
him one cowardly cry of agony.  Still he hurls defiance at Jove 
and challenges him to do his worst: he may weary out Vulcan and 
all his smiths in Etna forging bolts to hurl at him with all his 
might, but never would he give him the satisfaction of `a joyous 
vengeance.'  At first, indeed, we cannot help feeling a touch of 
admiration for this strong indomitable soul who refuses to cower 
and whimper like the rest, but Virgil rebukes our admiration.  It 
is strength, but it is not admirable: such final and invincible 
hardening of the soul against God in bitter defiance recoils in 
torture on the man himself, and, as Virgil says, more than any 
punishment from without, fills up the measure of his pain: 
 
     `O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished 
     Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more; 
     Not any torment, saving thine own rage, 
     Would be unto thy fury pain complete.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xiv. 63-66.] 
 
	|76-90.~  Not daring to venture on the Sandy Plain for fear of
the fire, Virgil and Dante skirt the edge of it to the left,
keeping along the margin of the Forest of Suicides.  After a
conversation with one of the Blasphemers, they come at last to a
place where a little rivulet of blood gushes from the wood, `whose
redness,' says Dante, `still makes me shudder.'  It is, as we shall
see, the overflow of Phlegethon the River of Blood, and is the
symbol of the sins of hot passion punished in this central region
of the Inferno.  Flowing across the Plain to its centre, it plunges
in one wild leap down a vast precipice to the Circle of Fraud 
beneath.  At the part of its course across the sand, it has two 
peculiarities.  One is that its bottom and sides have become 
petrified, thus forming a stony channel which keeps it from 
spreading over the Plain and losing itself in the sand.  For some 
reason, perhaps mere love of definiteness, Dante is very exact 
about the size of the walls of this channel.  He compares them {XV,
vv. 4-12} to the sea-dykes which the Flemings had built between
Bruges and Wissant, a well-known mediaeval port near Calais, to
keep out the waves, and to the walls by which the Paduans protected
their houses and villages from the floods of the Brenta -- `albeit
not so lofty nor so thick.'  On the level top of one of these stone
margins the poet and his guide walked to the centre of the Sandy 
Waste.  It is possible that all this is only a poetic device to 
provide a pathway for the travellers; but if the stone channel 
has any symbolic significance, it perhaps indicates the 
petrifying power which sins of hot-blooded violence have upon the 
human heart [comp. ^Inf.~ xviii. 1-3.  The whole of Malebolge is 
`of stone and of an iron colour' in symbol of the hardness of 
heart of the Fraudulent].  The other peculiarity of the River in 
this part of its course is that it sends forth a smoke or mist, 
which quenches the flakes of fire that rain down upon the sand. 
This also may be nothing more than an ingenious device to get the 
travellers across the Plain unscorched by the falling flames; but 
from the cast of Dante's mind it is much likelier that some 
symbolism is meant, though it is extremely difficult to say what. 
If we connect it with the explanation of the rivers of Hell which 
Virgil presently gives, this mist rising from one of them may 
mean the power which the mere contemplation of such floods of sin 
and suffering has to quench in a man's heart the sins of this 
Plain, and therefore the flames which are their punishment.  For, 
as we shall see, the rivers are composed of the tears which 
outrage and wrong have wrung from countless generations, and the 
mere sight of such `waters of affliction' may well wrap a man in 
a mist of pity and grief, which will effectually quench all 
desire for the sins which are their source. 
 
	|94-119.~  We now come to the mystical account of the four
infernal rivers which Virgil gives to Dante as they stand beside
this blood-red stream, the most notable thing, he says, that they
have yet seen in Hell.  Within Mount Ida in Crete, `once glad with 
waters and with leaves,' but now `deserted as a thing outworn,' 
stands erect `a great Old Man,' his back turned to Damietta in 
Egypt, his face gazing at Rome `as if it were his mirror.' 
 
     `His head is fashioned of refined gold 
     And of pure silver are the arms and breast, 
     Then he is the brass as far down as the fork; 
     From that point downward all is chosen iron, 
     Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay, 
     And more he stands on that than on the other.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xiv. 106-111.] 
 
With the exception of the golden head, each part is cleft by a 
fissure through which tears drop into the cavern, and thence fall 
into the abyss of Hell: 
 
     `From rock to rock they fall into this valley; 
     Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form; 
     Then downward go along this narrow sluice 
     Unto that point where is no more descending; 
     They form Cocytus.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xiv. 115-119.] 
 
	The interpretation is far from easy.  Crete seems to be 
chosen for several reasons.  In that Third Book of the 
^AEneid~, so often alluded to in this part of the ^Inferno~, 
Virgil speaks of Crete as the nursery of the Trojan race and 
therefore of the Roman, and this is probably one reason why `the 
great Old Man' is gazing towards Rome as to his mirror [^AEn.~ 
iii. 104-106].  But in addition to this, Crete was regarded as 
the cradle of the human race as a whole, situated as it is in the 
centre of the then known world, Asia, Africa, and Europe.  In 
short, it was the heathen Garden of Eden, and Dante, here as in 
so many other places, easily adapts the Greek mythology to his 
own uses.  It was under Saturn, its king in the Golden Age, that 
`the world of old was chaste.'  Then too it was `glad with waters 
and with leaves,' in allusion to the fertility for which Crete 
was once famous.  The change from that Golden Age, when it was as 
`Eden the garden of God,' to the sad degenerate days when Dante 
saw it sitting in the sea `a wasted land' and `a thing outworn,' 
is to his mind an image of the way in which the sins of the race 
reduce the world which God made very good to a barren wilderness, 
like the Sandy Waste beside which he was standing. 
 
	Of the `great Old Man,' a multitude of interpretations 
have been given, with most of which it is not necessary to 
trouble ourselves.  There are, however, two leading views which 
are not necessarily in any real antagonism: it is quite 
conceivable that Dante had both before his mind.  All agree, of 
course, in tracing the image to the dream of Nebuchadnezzar in 
^Daniel~ (ii. 32, 33): `This image's head was of fine gold, his 
breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 
his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and par of clay,' though 
it is to be noticed that, as Toynbee points out, `Dante differs 
from Daniel in making the brass terminate with the trunk.'  The 
first interpretation to which reference has been made is, like 
that of Daniel, a political one.  The image stands for the Roman 
Empire in the successive stages of its history, and the working 
out of the symbolism may be given in Dean Plumptre's words.  `The 
"grand old form" is the symbol of the ideal of universal history 
as seen in the Roman Empire.  He looks away from Damietta on the 
eastern border of Egypt, ^i.e.~ westward, for that, from the 
poet's standpoint, is the direction of human progress.  Possibly 
there is a side glance at the fact that the time of the Crusades, 
in which Damietta had played so prominent a part, is now over, 
and that the work of the Empire now lay in the West rather than 
the East [the reference may be to the Crusades as a mistaken 
effort to turn the stream of history back to its source in the 
East.  Comp. Bishop Berkeley's lines: 
 
     `Westward the course of empire takes its way; 
     The four first acts already past, 
     A fifth shall close the drama with the day: 
     Time's noblest offspring is the last.' 
 
The fifth act is one Dante could scarcely foresee -- America]. 
He looks towards Rome as a mirror, for it is there only, as Dante 
thought, as the seat of a true Empire and a true Church, that his 
ideal of monarchy could be realized....  His golden age was that of
Augustus; the silver that of the beginning of the decline and 
fall; the third, that of the more complete decadence which ended 
in the division of the Eastern and Western empires.  The legs of 
iron point to the endless wars of the two empires.  The "right 
foot" of clay is the Western empire, which no longer rests on a 
firm foundation, the last hope of a strong empire having perished 
with the Hohenstaufen dynasty, but on the crumbling support of a 
purely selfish policy, leading, as it did, to corruption in both 
Church and Empire, and to internal dissensions in every city in 
Italy....  One notes the terrible grandeur of the symbol.  The 
sorrows and the tears of men, consequent on the gradual 
deterioration of the Empire, are the source from which flow, one 
out of the other, the rivers of Hell, the woes of the condemned. 
Cocytus, as the river of wailing, receives them all.' 
 
	There can be little doubt that some such thought was in 
Dante's mind, for it certainly fits in with his general political 
theories.  One might, indeed, suggest, with many of the older 
commentators, that the legs represent the Church and the Empire, 
rather than the two empires, Eastern and Western, the right foot 
of baked clay being the Church.  Although mankind leans most upon 
it, it is by far the weaker support, and the clay may crumble at 
any moment.  Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that Dante 
was thinking only of the Roman Empire and the Church.  He knew 
that men were sinning and suffering long before the Empire 
existed, and that the sins and tears of every generation, except 
the first golden one, must find their way down to this `lowest 
swamp of all the universe.'  The `great Old Man' is therefore the 
image of Time, the gradual deterioration of the human race as a 
whole from its Golden Age when `the world was chaste,' down 
through the successive stages of its history, until it has 
reached its lowest degradation, resting most upon its right foot 
which is clay.  If, as seems likely, this right foot is the 
church, we can see to what an almost hopeless pass this world has 
come in Dante's judgment, when that which ought to be the 
strongest support of the whole body of mankind was a foot of 
crumbling clay. 
 
	As pointed out in a previous chapter, the four rivers of 
Hell, thus formed by the tears of Time, seem to be in reality one 
and the same river, changing both name and appearance as it 
drains down through the lost world.  They are the infernal 
counterpart of the fourfold river of Eden, or perhaps of the 
twofold river of the new Eden on the top of Mount Purgatory.  The 
great moral idea which they represent to Dante's mind is that 
there is not a tear shed on earth through man's inhumanity to 
man, which does not flow back in rivers of agony upon those who 
wrung them from their fellows.  Not a tear is lost, every one has 
to be paid for, -- yes, the very tears of the penitent and 
forgiven.  When Dante passes beyond Cocytus, the last river of 
Hell, and climbs the dark passage on the other side which leads 
up to `the bright world,' he bears the sound of a rivulet which 
he cannot see because it has eaten a passage for itself in the 
stone -- in all probability the tears that fall from another 
mountain than Ida in Crete, the Mount of Purification.  The sins 
and tears even of the penitent and forgiven flow back to the 
infernal source form which they came.
