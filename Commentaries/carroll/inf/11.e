	|1-7.  Leaving the narrow path that ran immediately inside the
walls and parallel with them, they resume their leftward direction,
striking straight across the City in order to reach the centre of 
the valley to which it dips on every side.  Here they find an 
abyss ringed round with broken rocks, which forms the wild and 
dangerous stairway to the underground dungeons of the City, in 
which are tortured `a still more cruel throng.'  From the mouth 
of this pit, as from a volcano, there rises a stench so foul and 
sickening that they are forced to take refuge behind a great 
tomb, to grow accustomed to `the sad blast' before they venture 
to descend.  The symbolism is obvious: the stench indicates that 
we have now reached a deeper and darker corruption -- the sins 
beneath, as it were, rot human nature, and cannot be faced 
without a sickening horror. 
 
	|8-9.~  The inscription on the great tomb behind which Dante
and Virgil took shelter ran as follows: 
 
               `Pope Anastasius I hold, 
     Whom out of the straight way Photinus drew.'

The Pope referred to is Anastasius II., who died in 498, though 
some writers think Dante, misled by a passage in Gratian, mistook 
him for his contemporary and namesake, the Emperor.  The heresy 
of Photinus, a deacon of Thessalonica, with which this Pope was 
believed to be tainted, is said to have been the denial of the 
miraculous conception of our Lord.  Whatever uncertainties 
surround Anastasius and his heresy, however, the important point 
is that Dante is no believer in the doctrine of Papal 
infallibility.  He `wishes all men to know his opinion, that 
Popes are not exempt from heresy, and that it deserves greater 
punishment in them than in ordinary men,' -- when the 
fountainhead of the Faith is polluted, the stream which it feeds 
can hardly be pure [a much more remarkable instance is Pope 
Honorius I. (d.  638).  The sixth OEcumenical Council 
(Constantinople, 680) solemnly anathematized him, though more 
than forty years in his grave, for his leniency towards the 
heresy of the Monothelites.  This condemnation of a Pope for 
heresy was one of the principal arguments of the opponents of 
Papal Infallibility at the Vatican Council of 1870.  The case was 
forgotten during the Middle Ages, else Honorius might have borne 
Anastasius company in this City of Heresiarchs].  Hence 
Anastasius is buried on the very verge of the precipice which 
overhangs the nether pit: being the spiritual head, he is lower 
down than, for example, the Emperor, Frederick II., who is but 
the temporal head of the kingdom of God. 
 
	|22-27.~  While they are standing in the shelter of the tomb
to accustom themselves to the stench of the dungeons beneath,
Virgil at Dante's request, that the time might not be lost, gives
him a description of the Circles still to be traversed.  Over this 
explanation a vast amount of discussion has taken place, arising 
in the main from what seems on the surface to be a cross-division 
of the classification of sins given by Virgil.  In lines 22-26 of 
Canto XI. a classification is given from Cicero; in lines 79-84 
what certainly seems to be another classification is given from 
Aristotle; and the entire discussion springs from the difficulty 
of setting the two in their right relations to each other.  We 
may lay aside at once the idea that Dante is guilty of a 
cross-division: he was far too sure and clear a thinker to commit 
such a blunder.  The classification from Aristotle is either 
capable of being equated with that from Cicero, or it is 
supplementary to it and introduced for some particular purpose 
which must not be confounded with the general scheme of 
classification. 
 
	Let us see first what the general scheme is, so far as 
concerns the Circles yet to come.  It is contained in Canto XI. 
22-27: 
 
     `Of every malice which wins hate in Heaven, 
     Injury is the end, and every such end 
     Either by force or fraud aggrieveth others. 
     But because fraud is man's peculiar vice, 
     More it displeaseth God; and so stand lower 
     The fraudulent, and more pain assails them.' 
 
There can be no doubt that this is taken from Cicero, though his 
name is not mentioned.  In his ^Offices~, to which Dante makes 
many references, Cicero discussing the question of justice says: 
`Now there are two ways of doing a man an injury: the one is by 
force, the other by fraud.  The one is the quality of the fox, 
the other of the lion.  They are neither of them proper for a 
man, but yet fraud is the more odious of the two; and of all 
injustices, that is the most abominable and capital which imposes 
upon us under the colour of kindness and good meaning' 
[^Offices~, bk. I. chap. xiii.  Notice the reference to lion and 
fox in the confession of Count Guido of Montefeltro in ^Inf.~ 
xxvii. 74, 75: `My deeds were not of the lion, but of the fox'], 
-- ^i.e.~ into which some element of treachery enters.  Obviously 
this is the source of the classification, which Virgil proceeds 
to explain in detail as follows. 

	|28-51.~  In Circle VII. are punished the Violent, souls that
sinned by the use of force.  They are divided into three classes,
according to the object on which their violence spent itself: 
 
	I.  The Violent against their Neighbours, either in 
person or goods: tyrants, homicides, marauders, freebooters, 
incendiaries, and such like. 
 
	II.  The Violent against Themselves, also in person or 
goods.  This Violence takes two forms: Suicide direct and 
indirect -- the indirect consisting of such things as reckless 
gambling and wanton dissipation of the means of life. 
 
	III.  The Violent against God -- directly, by denial and 
blasphemy; and indirectly, by `disdaining Nature and her bounty.' 
The latter is subdivided into Violence against Nature, of which 
Sodom is the type, and against Art, represented by the city of 
Cahors. 
 
	In this division Dante follows the distinction drawn by 
Thomas Aquinas between `sin against God, sin against self, and 
sin against one's neighbour,' though Aquinas takes care to say 
that these three species of sins are not exclusive of each other: 
`To sin against God, in so far as the order of relation to God 
includes every human relation, is common to all sin: but in so 
far as the order of relation to God goes beyond the other two 
orders (self and neighbour), in that way sin against God is a 
special kind of sin' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxxii. a. 4]. 

	Turning now to the wretched inhabitants of this barren 
land, let us see once more what their punishments are.  Violence 
against God takes three forms.  There is, first, direct defiance 
and blasphemy of the Most High, and sinners of this kind are 
flung upon the sand, with upturned faces, thus enduring the 
double pain of the fiery rain above and the burning soil beneath. 
Violence against Nature -- which is indirect violence against 
God, whose child Nature is -- is punished by a perpetual unrest: 
the Sodomites are kept running over the burning sand, and if one 
dares to stop for a moment, the penalty is to lie for a hundred 
years without liberty to cast off the falling flames.  Violence 
against Art or Work -- a still more indirect form of Violence 
against God, since Art is His `grandchild' -- is Usury; and the 
Usurers sit under the fiery storm, crouching as of old over their 
moneybags, and gazing for ever at the Waste of Sand, the emblem 
of their own barren and wasted lives. 
 
	It is obvious that although, as Dante says, these three 
classes are set under `a diverse law,' there are certain elements 
of punishment common to them all.  One is the barrenness of which 
the sandy desert is the symbol.  The conditions of fruitfulness 
are humble submission to God, obedience to His ordained order of 
Nature, and due fulfilment of His great law of Art of Work, `In 
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread'; and to defy those 
conditions is to reduce all life to a desert.  Dante warns us 
that to persist in this defiance for a lifetime is to doom 
ourselves to the continuance of the same empty, profitless, 
barren existence in the world to come.  We ploughed the sand 
here, and the sand becomes our eternal portion -- without grass 
or flower or tree to refresh the eye.  No one can tell how flat, 
barren, and arid may stretch the desert wastes of the soul that 
has spent its earthly years in defiance of the very conditions of 
fruitfulness which God has ordained. 
 
	The fiery rain represents the intolerable anguish of this 
empty barren existence, which has thus violated the natural laws 
of a fruitful and happy life.  It is suggested, of course, by the 
`brimstone and fire' which God rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah, 
-- Sodomy being one of the sins here punished.  Dante is not 
thinking of literal material fire.  If, as he firmly believed, we 
are made to find our peace and joy in God and in His ordinances 
of Nature and Work, it follows that long and persistent defiance 
and violation of this creative purpose must produce in the soul a 
tormenting, burning, inescapable pain.  Nor is it merely the pain 
of unfruitfulness: it is also the sense of the direct and 
immediate anger and judgment of Heaven falling on the soul.  In 
other parts of the Inferno God has, so to speak, delegated His 
judgment to intermediate means and agents; but here He keeps in 
His own hands the doom of those who have directly defied Himself. 
The Blasphemer, for example, measures himself directly against 
the Almight, intending, as Aquinas says, to `wound His honour'; 
and this direct striking at God recoils on the soul in that 
burning sense of His direct and immediate anger, which Dante 
represents under the form of the rain of fire from Heaven. 
 
	A third punishment which is common to the three classes 
of sinners here, is the disfigurement which the fiery rain works 
on face and form.  Dante tells us that the face of Brunetto 
Latini, which he remembered gratefully on earth as `dear, and 
good, and fatherly,' was now so scorched and `baked' that he had 
difficulty in recognizing it.  Of a certain troop of unnatural 
sinners he exclaims: 
 
     Ah me!  what wounds I saw upon their limbs, 
     Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in! 
     It pains me still but to remember it. 
                              [^Inf.~ xvi. 10-12.] 
 
Dante's meaning seems to be that while some sins register 
themselves on the body in this present life in scars and wounds 
and features brutified, there are others which leave no such 
visible trace.  On earth, for instance, Ser Brunetto's kind and 
fatherly countenance showed no sign of the unnatural lust which 
in the end carried him down to this Circle; nevertheless, now 
that the veil of the flesh is stripped away, the marks of its 
scorching fires are only too visible upon his naked soul.  So 
also with the others.  As we shall see, many of them were great 
soldiers, statesmen, and men of letters, who bore in this world a 
dignified and honourable front, which gave no hint to their 
fellows of the degrading, disfiguring passions within.  These 
become visible only when death strips the soul of utter 
nakedness.  It reminds us of Plato's myth of judgment in the 
^Gorgias.~  In the time when Cronos was king of the gods, and 
even under Zeus, judgment was passed on men while still clothed 
in flesh.  The consequence was that the judge, being unable to 
discern the soul infallibly through this clothing, sometimes 
erred and sent men to the wrong places in the other world.  To 
remedy this, Zeus ordained that judgment be postponed till after 
death, for `when a man is stripped of the body, all the natural 
or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to view.  And 
when they come to the judge, as those from Asia come to 
Rhadamanthus, he places them near him and inspects them quite 
impartially, not knowing whose the soul is: perhaps he may lay 
hands on the soul of the great king, or some other king or 
potentate, who has no soundness in him, but his soul is marked 
with the whip, and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries 
and crimes with which each action has stained him, and he is all 
crooked with falsehood and imposture, and has no straightness, 
because he has lived without truth.  Him Rhadamanthus beholds, 
full of all deformity and disproportion, which is caused by 
licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and despatches 
him ignominiously to his prison, and there he undergoes the 
punishment which he deserves' [^Gorgias~, 523-525].  This 
contrast between the fair appearance of the flesh and the scarred 
deformity of the soul within, is one of the leading ideas of this 
punishment, -- between the countenance of Ser Brunetto as Dante 
remembers it on earth, `dear, and good, and fatherly,' and the 
countenance of his naked soul as he sees it in this Circle, baked 
and scorched almost past recognition by the fires of the 
unnatural passions which here he concealed behind the kindly 
venerable face. 
 
	These three penalties -- the barren sand, the fiery rain, 
and the disfigurement of the soul -- are common to the three 
classes of sinners here tormented; but in addition, each has 
other punishments peculiar to itself, according to the special 
form of its sin.  Take first the Violent against God directly, 
defiers and blasphemers of the Almighty.  Dante tells us that 
they are far fewer in number than those who are running round the 
Plain, that is, the Sodomites.  The reason is obvious.  Not many 
are bold enough to give a direct defiance to Heaven.  `The 
blasphemer,' says Aquinas, `intends to wound the honour of God' 
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xiii. a. 3], but few have the reckless evil 
courage necessary for a sin so desperate and high-handed.  On the 
other hand, multitudes who shrink from this open defiance of God 
live daily in a secret defiance, by the violation of that great 
natural order of things which He has ordained.  Open and direct 
blasphemers and defiers, says Dante, suffer a double pain.  Flung 
on their backs upon the ground, they endure the burning sand 
beneath and the fiery wrath of Heaven on their upturned faces. 
This was the attitude of their faces when they lifted them to 
Heaven in wild and blasphemous defiance, and now they are 
compelled to maintain it for ever.  In one important point, 
however, their general attitude is wofully changed.  In the old 
blasphemous days they ^stood~ and defied their Maker: now they 
are flung upon the ground, beaten down by the storm of His 
indignation, and compelled to feel throughout eternity their 
absolute impotence against the Almightiness which they so 
insanely challenged.  Now at last they recognize their madness, 
and bewail it in loud lamentations.  We are told that they had 
`their tongues more loosed to pain' than the other classes of 
sinners on the sand.  It may be because their pain was greater; 
but the more probable reason is that Dante wishes to indicate the 
cowardice which commonly lies at the root of blasphemy. 

	|52-66.~  Virgil proceeds to explain Circles VIII. and IX., in
which Fraud is punished.  Fraud is called `man's peculiar vice,' 
evidently because it springs from man's peculiar gift of reason. 
For the possession of reason is that which distinguishes man from 
the lower animals; and the special guilt of Fraud is that it is 
the use of this high and distinctive endowment for the injury of 
others.  Fraud is of two degrees or qualities, according to the 
bond and knot of human fellowship which it severs: 
 
	I.  Fraud against `the bond of love which Nature makes.' 
This is the bond of common humanity, and those who break it by 
Fraud are punished in Circle VIII., being distributed in ten 
Moats or Pits, according to their particular form of the sin -- 
hypocrites, thieves, simoniacs, panders, barrators, `and such 
like filth.' 
 
	II.  Fraud against a twofold bond: this general one of 
Nature, and another which creates `a special faith.'  It is at 
this point that Fraud deepens and darkens into Treachery, which, 
as a cold-blooded sin, is frozen fast in the lake of ice which 
constitutes the lowest Circle of Hell: beyond this, human 
depravity cannot go.  The souls in `this bottom of the doleful 
shell' are divided into four classes according to the `special 
faith' they have betrayed: Traitors to their Kindred, to their 
Country, to their Friends and Guests, and last and vilest, to 
their Lords and Benefactors. 
 
	|67-75.~  With this account of nether Hell, Dante expresses
himself entirely satisfied, but he feels that it leaves unexplained
the Circles above through which he has just passed.  Why, he asks, 
are the sinners of those Circles not punished here `inside of the 
red city': `those of the fat lagoon' (the Wrathful and Sullen), 
`whom the wind leads' (the Sensual), `whom the rain beats' (the 
Gluttons), and `who encounter with such sharp tongues' (Misers 
and Prodigals)?  Is it because God is not angry with these that 
they are not inside the City of Dis?  -- and if so, why are they 
punished at all?  

	|76-84.~  Virgil's answer is that all the sins of Hell 
are punished according to the order of their hatefulness to 
Heaven.  It is at this point that the classification of sins from 
Aristotle is brought in.  Virgil rebukes Dante with some 
sharpness for having forgotten it: 
 
                         `Why wanders so 
     Thine intellect from that which is its wont? 
     Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking? 
     Hast thou no recollection of those words 
     With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses 
     The dispositions three, that Heaven wills not, -- 
     Incontinence, Malice, and insane 
     Bestiality? and how Incontinence 
     Less God offendeth, and less blame demands?'
 
The reference is to the opening words of Book VIII. of the 
^Nicomachean Ethics~: `There are three species of moral character 
which ought to be avoided, viz., vice, incontinence, and 
brutality.'  It is perfectly obvious that this is introduced, not 
as a second classification of sins, but simply for the particular 
purpose of explaining why sins of Incontinence are not inside the 
City of Dis along with Violence and Fraud: sins of impulse and 
want of self-control are less offensive to God than malicious 
wickedness and brutality. 
 
	Nevertheless, although thus obviously introduced for this 
special purpose, it is natural to suppose that this 
classification from Aristotle coincided in Dante's own mind with 
the other from Cicero, so far as the lower Circles are concerned; 
in other words, that `Malice and mad Bestiality' correspond in 
some fashion to Violence and Fraud.  There is certainly a strong 
temptation to identify Brutishness and Violence.  In the Circle 
of the Violent, the various guardians and tormentors, as 
Wicksteed points out, are either beasts or forms in which the 
brute mingles with the human: the Minotaur, the Centaurs, the 
Harpies, and the she-mastiffs which tear in pieces the reckless 
prodigals.  This, in a writer like Dante, can scarcely be a mere 
coincidence; yet the attempt which is sometimes made to include 
all the forms of Violence in Circle VIII. in the Aristotelian 
conception of Brutishness, can scarcely be regarded as 
successful.  On the whole, it is perhaps safer to say that the 
classification of sins is founded mainly on Cicero, but that the 
working out of it is strongly coloured with Aristotelian ideas 
[for a discussion of this most intricate question, see 
Wicksteed's note in Appendix to Witte's ^Essays on Dante~, 434-438. 
Dr. Moore is inclined to accept Boccaccio's story that the 
poem was interrupted by political troubles at the end of Canto 
vii., its resumption long after being marked by the opening words 
of Canto viii., `I say, ^continuing.~'  On this assumption, he 
thinks Dante may have begun the ^Inferno~ on one moral plan and 
finished it on another: `It does not seem to me impossible to 
suppose that Dante may have actually ^begun~ the ^Inferno~ with 
an idea of following the classification of the Seven Deadly Sins, 
but, finding it after a certain point unsuitable, he may have 
adopted a different method, and then have invented the ^ex post 
facto~ explanation of Canto xi. as an ingenious way of covering 
the change of plan and giving a factitious appearance of unity of 
design to the composite work' (^Studies in Dante~, second series, 
168)]. 
 
	|94-96.~  When the explanation is finished, Dante puts to his
Guide one final question concerning the sin of Usury: 
 
     `Once more a little backward turn thee,' said I, 
     `There where thou sayest that usury offends 
     The Divine Goodness, and untie the knot.'
 
The difficulty is not that Usury is a sin: of that the 
mediaeval mind had no doubt.  It was that Virgil had declared 
it a sin ^against God~, an offence to the Divine Goodness.  Was 
it not rather a sin against man? -- why, then, had Virgil said 
that it is punished in the Circle of the Violent against God? 
This reference to Usury is contained in the single word `Cahors' 
in line 50 of this Canto.  Cahors is a city in the Department of 
Lot in the South of France, famous, or rather infamous, in 
Dante's day as a nest of usurers.  If Boccaccio is to be 
believed, the very servant-maids lent out their wages.  Writing 
in the first half of the thirteenth century, Matthew Paris says: 
`In these days prevailed the horrible nuisance of the Caursines 
to such a degree that there was hardly any one in all England, 
especially among the bishops, who was not caught in their net. 
Even the King was held indebted to them in an incalculable sum of 
money.  For they circumvented the needy in their necessities, 
cloaking their usury under the show of trade, and pretending not 
to know that whatsoever is added to the principal is usury, under 
whatever name it may be called.'  In short, Caorsine was a synonym 
for usurer [comp. ^Par.~ xxvii. 58, 59: 
 
     `Of our blood Caorsines and Gascons 
     Prepare themselves to drink.' 
 
The reference is to Clement V., a Gascon, and John XXII., a 
native of Cahors]. 
 
	|97-111.~  Now, the strange thing is that Sodom and Cahors are
put together in the same Circle, the reason being that both are 
regarded as sinners against Nature.  This is obvious in the case 
of Sodom, which represents unnatural sensuality; but how comes it 
that Usury is also a sin against Nature?  Virgil answers this 
question partly from Aristotle and partly from Scripture, almost 
equal authorities in Dante's mind.  In his ^Physics~ (ii. 2) 
Aristotle says, `Art imitates Nature.'  But Nature is the child 
of God, offspring of the Divine Intellect; and Art -- that is, 
any work or craft of man -- which imitates Nature, may therefore 
be called the child of Nature and, as it were, the grandchild of 
God.  According to the Book of Genesis, from these two, Nature 
and Art, `mankind gain their life and advance [it is somewhat 
strange to find Virgil quoting Scripture.  Probably the reason is 
that the passage refers to a truth which lies within the 
knowledge of the natural man].  In other words, man must get his 
livelihood from Nature: `The Lord God took the man, and put him 
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it'; and he must 
get it by means of Art or work: `In the sweat of thy face shalt 
thou eat bread.'  But the usurer `takes another way,' and 
`elsewhere puts his hope.'  That is to say, he evades the Divine 
law of work laid down for man at the beginning.  Disdaining work 
or Art, he disdains Nature of which it is the imitator; 
disdaining Nature, he disdains God whose child she is.  Hence it 
is that Blasphemers, Sodom, and Cahors are all placed in the same 
Circle: Blasphemers do direct violence to God, defying Himself; 
Sodomites do violence to Nature, which is the child of God; and 
Caorsines or Usurers to Art, which is, so to speak, His 
grandchild.  And of the three Dante regards the last as the 
worst, for, as we shall see, he sets the Usurers on the very edge 
of the precipice which overhangs the next Circle, as if morally 
they almost belonged to it. 
 
	Into the question of the Ethics of Usury, recently 
revived by Ruskin, there is no need to enter further than is 
necessary to show how it looked to the mediaeval mind.  We 
apply the word Usury now to the taking of ^exorbitant~ interest, 
but the original idea was undoubtedly the taking of ^any.~  The 
ground for this was Scriptural; in ^Leviticus~ it is written: `If 
thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then 
thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a 
sojourner, that he may live with thee.  Take thou no usury of 
him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live 
with thee.  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor 
lend him thy victuals for increase.'  This prohibition is 
repeated in ^Deuteronomy~, where, however, the taking of usury 
from strangers is expressly allowed [^Lev.~ xxv. 35-37; ^Deut.~ 
xxiii. 19, 20].  The wisest of the heathen take the same view. 
Plato in his ^Laws~ says: `No one shall lend money upon interest; 
and the borrower shall be under no obligation to repay either 
capital or interest'; and in the ^Republic~ he describes usurers 
in these scornful words: `The men of business, stooping as they 
walk, and pretending not even to see those whom they have already 
ruined, insert the sting -- that is, their money -- into some one 
else who is not on his guard against them, and recover the parent 
sum many times multiplied into a family of children: and so they 
make drone and pauper to abound in the State' [Plato -- ^Laws~, 
v. 742; ^Rep.~ viii. 555].  This reference to `the parent sum 
multiplied into a family of children,' recalls Aristotle's view 
which was undoubtedly in Dante's mind when he declares that Usury 
is -- at least indirectly -- a violation of Nature.  Aristotle 
argues from the Greek name for Usury, %tau%$o%kappa%o%varsigma\, 
which means ^offspring~.  The very name is its condemnation, for 
it implies that money breeds money; and money being in itself a 
barren thing, he argues that to cause it to produce `offspring' 
is a violation of Nature.  In his ^Politics~ he writes: `Of all 
bad forms of Finance there is none which so well deserves 
abhorrence as petty usury, because in it it is money itself which 
produces the gain instead of serving the purpose for which it was 
devised.  For it was invented simply as a medium of exchange, 
whereas interest multiplies the money itself.  Indeed it is to 
this fact it owes its name (%tau%$o%kappa%o%varsigma\ or 
^offspring~), as children bear a likeness to their parents, and 
interest is money born of money.  It may be concluded, therefore, 
that no form of money-making does so much violence to Nature as 
this' [^Politics~, i. 10.  Comp. ^The Merchant of Venice~, Act. 
I, Scene 3: 
 
               `For when did friendship take 
     a breed for barren metal of his friend?']. 
 
From this passage, the barrenness of money became proverbial in 
the Middle Ages, and of course Dante was perfectly familiar with 
it.  The Church passed severe laws against the taking of 
interest: a cleric was suspended, a layman excommunicated. 
 
	The change in economic conditions which has come over the 
world has compelled the Church to take up a different attitude to 
this question, allowing the taking of interest for ordinary 
commercial purposes, and confining the name of usury to the 
exaction of excessive and extortionate interest.  In justice to 
the Church, it can scarcely be held with fairness that this 
change involves any real inconsistency, or proves that her 
mediaeval attitude was an error.  In those days, and under the 
conditions of life then prevailing, there was very little lending 
of money for commercial purposes.  The borrower as a rule was not 
a solvent man who sought money to extend a prosperous business 
and increase his profits: he was usually a man in need, who asked 
a loan to stave off impending ruin, and whose very necessity 
placed him at the mercy of unscrupulous lenders.  Even if the 
Church overshot the mark somewhat in declaring ^all~ interest 
sinful, it was an error which leant to virtue's side in face of 
the conditions of the age, the notorious cruelties of 
moneylenders, and the widespread poverty and ruin which followed 
their operations.  On the whole we shall not be greatly in error 
if we accept the conclusion of a Roman Catholic political 
economist of our time: `In reality the essential wrongfulness of 
making profit without labour, risk, or responsibility from the 
property of others, of claiming an increase from what is 
essentially barren, of turning the simplicity or distress of 
others to one's own gain, has been maintained by the Church from 
her foundation to this day; and the resort of usurers, whether in 
the Temple of Jerusalem, the drinking shops of Poland, or the 
loan offices of England, she has ever looked on as a den of 
thieves.  Usury is just as unlawful now as in the middle ages; 
but many transactions bearing the same name or appearance, which 
were usurious then, are now innocent; the Church rightly forbade 
them then, and as rightly permits them now' [Devas' ^Political
