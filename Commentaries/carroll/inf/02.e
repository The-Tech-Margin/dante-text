	|1-6.~ When Virgil first offered his guidance, Dante tells us
he was all eagerness to follow him; but when the hour of evening 
came, the shadows of doubt fell with the shadows of the night. 
The loneliness of the pilgrimage, the toil and greatness of the 
way, the wofulness of the sights which awaited him, and the 
uncertainty of his own powers -- all made him pause in 
irresolution and fear.  He does not say whether it is the fear of 
the author or the fear of the sinner, but we cannot doubt that he 
was assailed by both.  A poem like the ^Commedia~, in which the 
whole life, spirit, and learning of the Middle Ages are 
condensed, cannot have been undertaken and carried out without 
many a fear and hesitation; its very greatness must have made the 
heart that conceived it tremble and almost despair.  Much more 
important, however, is the moral hesitation.  Dante knows that he 
is beginning the great pilgrimage of a sinful human soul to its 
God.  At first, eagerness to escape from the dark and savage 
wilderness of his sins uplifts his heart; but this is quickly 
followed by the natural recoil of despondency.  The man who sees 
at once the lowness of his own soul and far above him that 
righteousness of God which is `like the great mountains,' cannot 
but have his Slough of Despond, his dark hour when the great 
enterprise of salvation almost drops from his trembling hands. 

	|7-9.~  We come now to the true beginning of the ^Commedia~,
for the opening Canto is merely introductory to the whole poem. 
This is proved, among other things, by the fact that Dante in this
Second Canto makes his invocation to the Muses, while the
corresponding invocations in the ^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~ occur
in the opening Cantos.  It is perhaps worth while noticing in
passing that the three invocations rise in solemnity with the
increasing sanctity of the subject: here the poet appeals simply to
the Muses; in the ^Purgatorio~ to the `holy Muses'; and in the 
^Paradiso~ to `good Apollo' -- the sun, which he calls in the 
^Convito~ the sensible image of God. 

	|31-33.~  In his perplexity and fear Dante takes counsel of
Reason in the person of Virgil, appealing to him to decide whether
his powers are equal to the vast and mysterious pilgrimage.  It is
true, he grants, that two other instances exist of successful 
journeys into the Invisible.  Virgil himself had sung how Aeneas 
had `dared to enter the Inferno alone with the Sibyl in search of 
his father Anchises, in the face of so many dangers' [^Conv.~ iv. 
26]; and Paul, `the Chosen Vessel,' tells how `he was caught up 
into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not 
lawful for a man to utter' [^2 Cor.~ xii. 4].  But was it not 
presumption to dream that he could descend to Hell with AEneas, 
and mount to Heaven with Paul? 
 
     `But I, why hither come, or who concedes it? 
     I not AEneas am, I am not Paul, 
     Nor I nor others think me worthy of it.'
 
Paul's vision, for instance, was given for the comfort of the 
Christian Faith; and AEneas was worthy to become a pilgrim of 
the Invisible because he was the chosen father of that mighty 
Roman Empire which was destined of Heaven to be the seat and home 
of that Faith on earth, -- 
 
                    `the holy place wherein 
     Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.'  
     [^Inf.~ ii. 23, 24.] 
 
This setting of AEneas and Paul side by side is the first 
instance of a characteristic of Dante which meets us constantly 
throughout the poem, namely, the parallelism which he follows 
between sacred and profane history and legend.  His custom is to 
give from both alternate examples of sins and virtues.  To 
understand him, we must dismiss from our minds the sharp contrast 
we are accustomed to draw between Holy Scripture and the writings 
of such men as Aristotle and Virgil.  The ^AEneid~ is quoted as 
of almost parallel authority with Scripture, AEneas and Paul 
are set side by side.  If we wish to understand why, we must 
study Dante's political theories as set forth at length in the 
^De Monarchia~.  A large portion of that curious treatise is 
occupied with a series of arguments to prove that the empire of 
the world belonged of right to the Romans as the noblest people 
upon earth.  One of his proofs is that AEneas `was ennobled 
from all three continents both by his forefathers and his wives.' 
He proceeds to show that both forefathers and wives belonged to 
Asia, Africa, and Europe; and on this he founds the curious 
argument that universal monarchy -- the right to govern the three 
continents -- belongs lawfully to his descendants.  `Who,' he 
asks triumphantly, `will not rest persuaded that the father of 
the Romans, and therefore the Romans themselves, were the noblest 
people under heaven?  Who can fail to see the divine 
predestination shown forth by the double meeting of blood from 
every part of the world in the veins of one man?' [^De Mon.~ ii. 
3].  An equally curious argument is used in the ^Convito~, from 
the comtemporaneousness of the birth of David and the founding of 
Rome: `It was at one and the same time that David was born and 
that Rome was born; that is, AEneas came from Troy into Italy, 
which was the origin of the most noble city of Rome, as our books 
bear witness.  Thus the divine election of the Roman Empire is 
made very evident by the birth of the holy city, which was 
contemporaneous with that of the root from which sprang the race 
of Mary' [^Conv.~ iv. 5].  So sacred in his eyes was Rome that 
it became the earthly symbol of the Celestial City -- `that Rome 
where Christ is Roman' [^Purg.~ xxxii. 102].  It is certainly not 
too much to say with Dr. Moore that to Dante `the people of Rome, 
as founders of the Empire, were as much God's "chosen people" as 
the Jews.  Each was so "chosen" for carrying out one branch of 
His great twofold design; both these branches, moreover, coming, 
as it were, to maturity together in the nearly synchronous events 
of the establishment of the Roman Empire and the Incarnation of 
Christ' [^Studies in Dante~, second series, pp. 21, 22]. 
 
	|43-48.~  Returning to the narrative, let us see by what
arguments Reason overcame Dante's shrinking from the ardous
pilgrimage.  Virgil tells him plainly that his soul is `attainted
with cowardice.'  Now, if there was any one thing the strenuous
soul of Dante could not bear, it was any cowardly shrinking from
the moral responsibilities of life.  We shall see immediately how
he invented a special place of torment for the Neutrals -- men and 
angels who through cowardly fear were neither for God nor against 
Him.  His scorn of them is intense:  Heaven and Hell alike reject 
them, and earth will not tolerate their memory.  The charge of 
cowardice, therefore, was precisly that best fitted to sting 
Dante to activity.  Probably what he had specially in view was 
the virtue which Aristotle calls Magnanimity or great-mindedness 
-- the mean between vanity and pusillanimity, between an over- and 
an under-estimate of one's self.  `A high-minded' (or 
greatsouled) `person seems to be one who regards himself as 
worthy of high things, and who is worthy of them' [Aristotle's 
^Ethics~, bk. iv. 7.  Comp. ^Conv.~ i. 11.  High-mindedness is 
distinguished from small-mindedness, which under-estimates, and 
vanity, which over-estimates, its own worth.  According to 
Aquinas, when a man `denies of himself some greatness which at 
the same time he perceives to be in himself,' he is guilty of 
self-depreciation, which is sinful because a departure from truth 
(^Summa~, ii-ii. q. 113, a. 1)].  That it is this high-minded 
estimate of himself which Virgil is urging on him is proved by 
the name which Dante here gives him -- `the Magnanimous,' the 
Great-minded: 
 
     If I have well thy language understood,' 
     Replied that shade of the Magnanimous, 
     Thy soul attainted is with cowardice.'  
     [^Inf.~ ii. 43-45.] 
 
In short, it is the sign of true greatness of soul not only to be 
equal to great enterprises, but to ^know~ one's self equal to 
them.  Dante's fears and doubts made him under-estimate his own 
powers; and Virgil, who is Reason, seeks to rouse his 
`magnanimity,' a due and reasonable sense of the greatness of his 
own soul.  Nothing is more characteristic of Dante:  to 
undervalue one's self is no virtue, it is mere cowardice, which 
turns men back from `honoured enterprise.' 

	|94-96.~  Naturally, the Virgin Mary occupies a much more 
conspicuous place in the poem.  It is from her that the first 
movement of Divine aid to Dante springs: at her entreaty, Lucia 
and Beatrice act on his behalf.  It is she who `breaks the stern 
judgment of Heaven.'  On every Terrace of Mount Purgatory, the 
first example of each virtue by which penitent souls are urged on 
to holiness, is drawn from the Virgin's life.  In the ^Paradiso~, 
she is called `the Rose in which the Word Divine became 
incarnate.'  Her face is likest Christ's and in the mystic Rose 
of Paradise her place is nearest God.  Through her, power is 
given to gaze upon the mystery of the Blessed Trinity.  In Dante 
she represents the prevenient grace of God -- that Divine love 
which neither hangs upon our merits nor waits for the cry of our 
need.  Hence St. Bernard in his great prayer to her says that her 
aid outruns our prayers and anticipates our wants: 
 
     `Not only thy benignity gives succour 
     To him who asketh it, but oftentimes 
     Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.'  
     [^Par.~ xxxiii. 16-18] 

	|97.~  Of these `three blessed Ladies,' the least conspicuous
in the poem is Lucia.  We meet her twice again, once in the 
^Purgatorio~, when in his sleep she carries Dante up to the Gate 
of St. Peter: 
 
     `There came a Lady and said:  "I am Lucia; 
     Let me take this one up who is asleep, 
     So will I make his journey easier for him"'; 
     [^Purg.~ ix.  55-57] 

and again in the ^Paradiso~, where St. Bernard points her out in her
place in the snow-white Rose of the redeemed.  She is generally
regarded as Dante's patron saint, perhaps because he was once
threatened with blindness through excessive reading and weeping
[^Conv.~ iii. 9]: `Having wearied my eyes much with the labour of
reading, so weakened were the visual spirits, that all the stars
appeared to me to be blurred by some white mist.' -- Cf. ^Vita Nuova~,
32, for the effect on his eyes of excesive weeping].  Plumptre says,
`The martyr-saint of Syracuse, who in the Diocletian persecution had
torn out her eyes that her beauty might not minister to man's lust, was
much honoured in Florence, and two churches, still standing, were
dedicated to her.  The story of her death had made her the patron saint
of all who suffered from diseases of the eye [in Art she sometimes
bears a lighted lamp, sometimes a dish containing her two eyes, and
sometimes an awl, on which, in rare instances, her eyes are skewered.
See Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, ii. 613-619].  Dante
probably chooses her now as symbol of the better opening of the eyes of
the soul -- as her name implies, the illuminating grace of God.

	|103-105.~  But the principal interest and difficulty gather
round the third of the Ladies, Beatrice, for love of whom `he issued
from the vulgar herd' [^Inf.~ ii. 105].  The generally received view is
that which identifies her with Beatrice, daughter of a Florentine
gentleman, Folco Portinari, a near neighbour of the Alighieri family.
This, however, has been denied by many commentators.  In the beginning
of the ^Vita Nuova~, Dante says of her that she `was called Beatrice by
many who knew not what to call her'; from which the inference has been
drawn that the name Beatrice was employed as a screen to hide the true
object of Dante's love, and that it was only the mistaken tradition of
later times which identified her with Beatrice Portinari.  The very
existence of Beatrice as a woman of flesh and blood has been and is
denied, and she has been resolved into a mere symbolic personification,
standing for Ideal Womanhood, or Philosophy, Theology, the Ideal
Church, or the Ideal Empire.  For my own part, whether she was Beatrice
Portinari or another, I have no doubt she was in the first instance a
real woman.  When, for example, Dante meets her glorified spirit in the
Earthly Paradise, she speaks of her `buried flesh' and her `fair
members... which scattered are in earth'; and this can scarcely refer
to a mere symbolic abstraction [^Purg.~ xxxi. 47-51].  Just as little
doubt, however, is there that this lady, whoever she was, passed
through a marvellous process of idealization `into something rich and
strange' in the mystical imagination of the poet, becoming, as we have
seen, the symbol of Heavenly Wisdom.  Assuming that she was Beatrice
Portinari, we know that she married in 1287 to Simone de' Bardi of the
great Florentine banking house, and that she died in 1290 in her
twenty-fourth year.  In his earliest work, the ^Vita Nuova~, Dante
tells us the story of his love in that peculiar mystical manner of his
which has made it a beautiful enigma ever since.  It was in his ninth
year that he saw her for the first time, `clad in a subdued and goodly
crimson'; and at the sudden vision he tells us that `the spirit of life
which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart began to
tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook
therewith.'  Nine years after he met her in the street, and for the
first time received her salutation.  We need not hesitate to belive,
then, that Beatrice was a real woman, whom Dante's intensely mystical
imagination transfigured into a symbol of that Heavenly Wisdom whose
eyes, as he says in the ^Convito~, are her demonstrations of the truth,
and her smile her persuasions of it [^Conv.~ iii. 15].  After her death
in 1290, he resolved to write some great work in her praise; and of
this the ^Commedia~ is the fulfilment.  The closing words of the ^Vita
Nuova~ are: `After writing this sonnet, it was given unto me to behold
a very wonderful vision: wherein I saw things which determined me that
I would say nothing further of this most blessed one, until such time
as I could discourse more worthily concerning her.  And to this end I
labour all I can; as she well knoweth.  Wherefore if it be His pleasure
through whom is the life of all things, that my life continue with me a
few years, it is my hope that I shall yet write concerning her what
hath not before been written of any woman.  After the which, may it
seem good unto Him who is the Master of Grace, that my spirit should go
hence to behold the glory of its lady: to wit, of that blessed Beatrice
who now gazeth continually on His countenance ^qui est per omnia
saecula benedictus~.  ^Laus Deo~.'

	It is, then, this Beatrice, symbol of Divine Wisdom, who, for
Dante's salvation, leaves her place in Heaven beside the ancient
Rachel, symbol of Contemplation [^Inf.~ ii. 100-102; ^Par.~ xxxii.
7-9.], enters the Inferno, and charges Virgil to guide him to herself.
Nothing could show more clearly what is undoubtedly one of Dante's
leading convictions, namely, the essential unity of Nature and Grace.
Virgil is simply the servant of Grace: from her, in the person of
Beatrice, he takes his commands; and to her, in the person of Beatrice,
he conducts the soul.  In other words, although there is indeed a
distinction, there is no real antagonism, between Faith and Reason.
The natural morality of the cardinal virtues, which constitute the
Earthly Paradise, leads to the theological virtues of Faith, Hope and
Love, without which the Celestial Paradise cannot be attained.  The
truths of Christian Theology presuppose those of Natural Science and
Philosophy.  Just as Paul speaks of Law as our pedagogue to bring us to
Christ, so Dante calls Virgil or Reason, `the sweet pedagogue' [^Purg.~
xii. 3; ^Gal.~ iii. 24, Vulgate: `Itaque lex ^pedagogus~ noster fuit in
Christo.'].  This essential unity of Virgil and Beatrice, Nature and
Grace, Reason and Faith, is expressed in another mystical form in the
^Convito~.  Dante there compares the Ten Heavens to the various
sciences which together constitute Philosophy or Wisdom.  The seven
Planets, he says, correspond to the seven Sciences of the ^Trivium~ and
^Quadrivium~ which made up the mediaeval curriculum of education:
Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, and
Astronomy (or, as it was then called, Astrology).  The eighth sphere,
the Starry Heaven, with its Milky Way, represents Physics and
Metaphysics; the ninth or Crystalline Heaven, Moral Philosophy; while
the tenth or Empyrean, to which the rest lead, and which enfolds them
all, is `Divine Science, which is called Theology' [^Conv.~ ii.  14,
15.  For explanation of the mediaeval curriculum, see Ruskin's
^Mornings in Florence~, `The Strait Gate'].  In fine, Grace includes
Nature: Wisdom, like the Empyrean, folds in its sphere every earthly
science -- that Wisdom of which it was written of old: `When He
prepared the heavens, I was there; when with a sure law and a circle He
entrenched the abysses; when He established the aether above, and
balanced the fountains of the waters; when He marked out its limits for
the sea, and gave laws to the waters that they should not exceed their
bounds; when He appointed the foundations of the earth: then was I with
Him disposing of all things, and rejoicing in every day' [^Prov.~ viii.
27-30, Vulgate, quoted in ^Conv.~ iii. 15.  For further notice of
Beatrice, see the biographical chapter on Dante at the beginning, pp.
xxi-xxxii].

	|124-126.~  But Virgil has a still more potent persuasion.
Dante knew well that Reason by itself could never carry his great
venture to a successful issue, or finally deliver his soul from sin.
Hence Virgil -- who, we must constantly remind ourselves, is Reason
personified -- assures him that behind himself heavenly powers are
interested in his salvation.  Not of his own motion had he offered his
guidance; the task was laid upon him from above.  `A fair saintly Lady'
from Heaven, no other than Beatrice herself, had ventured into Hell to
entreat his aid for one who is `a friend of hers, and not the friend of
fortune.'  She herself, she tells him, had been entreated for him by
another heavenly Lady, `Lucia, foe of all that cruel is.'  Lucia, in
her turn, had been entreated by a third Lady, who said to her:

     Thy faithful one now stands in need Of thee, and unto thee I
     recommend him.'

This is the Virgin Mary, called here `a gentle Lady,' and, like her
Son, never directly named in the ^Inferno~ [^Inf.~ ii. 49-126].
