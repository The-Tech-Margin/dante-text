	|1-6.~  Of even greater interest in some ways is the
Christian example of an evil counsellor.  When Ulysses was
departing with Virgil's leave, the attention of the pilgrims was
arrested by the confused sound which issued from the top of
another of the flames, and which at last changed into an
articulate voice.  

	Turning now to the punishment of this sin of Fraudulent
Counsel, we find it to be threefold.  In the first place, each
flame is in the appropriate form of a tongue [^Inf.~ xxvi. 89],
the instrument of the instrument of the sin, and this tongue
completely folds in the soul, or, to use the poet's significant
words,

                 Not one reveals the theft,
     And every flame a sinner steals away {^Inf.~ xxvi. 41-42}.

The obvious meaning is that the tongue when used for the purpose
of giving cunning and fraudulent counsel conceals a man's soul. 
`Speech,' says a sarcastic divine of the seventeenth century,
`was given to the ordinary sort of men whereby to communicate
their mind; but to wise men whereby to conceal it.'  Dante denies
the wisdom of such concealment.  When a man lives a life of
crafty speech which hides his soul, the true thought and purpose
in the background, the time comes when he can use the gift of
language for no other end.  The power of sincere and transparent
speech is lost, and the man cannot reveal himself even if he
would.  His craftiness closes round him like these tongues of
fire, and he becomes for ever invisible to his fellowmen.  Nay,
the word `steals' which Dante uses, hints at a more terrible
punishment still -- the theft and shrinkage and decay of the soul
itself, until it grows so small that it can be confined within
the narrow flame of a firefly.  The soul of Ulysses himself, full
as it is of all knowledge of the world, is so stolen from him by
`the thievish fire' of his own crafty tongue that it dwindles
down at last to a mere spark.

	In the second place, these sinners, like the Suicides,
have great difficulty in speaking at all.  The tongue of fire
which concealed Ulysses began by tossing itself and murmuring
like a flame that struggles with the wind.  Similarly when Count
Guido tried to speak, at first nothing came but a confused sound:
the words, seeking for an outlet, were converted into the flame's
own language, the flickering murmur which it makes in the air. 
The idea is partly that the abuse of the power of speech is
punished by the withdrawal of it.  But also it is part of the
punishment already spoken of, the concealment of the soul.  It
cannot utter and reveal itself: by the abuse of it, the tongue
has closed in round the soul and refuses to express its thoughts
[^Inf.~ xxvi. 85-90; xxvii. 4-15.].

	Finally, each tongue is a tongue of fire.  The idea was
probably suggested by the words of St. James (iii. 6): `The
tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity amoung our members is the
tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the
wheel of nature (in the Vulgate, ^rotam nativitatis nostroe~, the
wheel of our birth), and is set on fire by hell.'  By this fire,
doubtless, Dante meant to indicate the element of pain:

                   `Within the fires the spirits are;
     Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.'
     [^Inf.~ xxvi. 47.]

It is one of Dante's most familiar thoughts.  As we have seen,
the sin of this Bolgia is primarily one of the intellect, and
`the good of the intellect' is the knowledge of God which is `the
true beatitude' of every human soul.  The souls of these Evil
Counsellors have foregone this good of the intellect by turning
their great powers of mind away from God who is their fulfilment
and bliss, to the wisdom of the world.  According to Dante,
whenever this perversion of the intellect from God takes place in
any form, it involves the soul in an agony as of fire: the souls
of Heretics, for example, are imprisoned in burning tombs.  We
shall better understand the doom of the spirits in `this blind
world' if we contrast it with the blessedness of those intellects
that made God their end.  Dante sets them in the Heaven of the
Sun in Paradise [^Par.~ x-xiv] -- great theologians and teachers
like Aquinas and Bonaventura.  Their souls too are invisible,
enclosed in bright flames, but with a world of difference.  The
flames are not their prison, but their freedom.  If they are
concealed, it is because they have been glad to lose themselves
in the light of God.  In the joy of this self-forgetfulness in
Him, they sing and move in `choral starry dance.'  Instead of
twinkling as fireflies in the dark valley of a `blind world,'
they shine as white stars, visible even against the bright
background of the Sun, which is the sensible image of God.  For
to these Counsellors of Truth and not of Fraud is fulfilled the
promise: `They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.'

	|19-27.~  The soul within had overheard Virgil using
Lombard speech when he said to Ulysses `Now go thy way, no more I
urge thee,' and therefore begged to know what events were
happening in `that sweet Latian land' from which he had fallen
into `this blind world.'  The Latin or Latian land is Italy, and
in particular the province of Romagna from which he had come.

	|28-30.~  The thing he wishes most to know is whether the
Romagnuoli have peace or war.  It was a natural question for one
who for many years had been the greatest soldier of the province,
and had held in his hands the innumerable threads of its
struggles, plots, and factions. 

	|32-33.~  Virgil bids Dante reply, because `this one is a
Latian'; whereupon the poet answers that at the moment of open
war there was none, but that in the bosoms of the tyrant-lords of
Romagna there never is nor was wanting the stuff of which war is
made. 

	|55-57.~  After giving him an account of the present
state of Ravenna, Rimini, and other towns of the province [the
towns are described for the most part by the coats of arms of
their tyrant-lords. `Ravenna is still, as it has been for years
past, under the eagle of the Polenta family, which now also
broods over Cervia (vv. 40-42); Forl@i is under the claws of the
green lion of the Ordelaffi (vv. 43-45); Rimini is under the Old
and Young Mastiffs (the Malatesta, vv. 46-48); Faenza and Imola
are under the lion-cub of Maghinardo Pagano (vv. 49-51); and
Cesena alternates between a state of tyranny and freedom (vv.
52-54).' -- Toynbee's ^Dictionary~, `Romagna'], Dante, who sees
only the flame and not the soul inside, begs him to say who he
is, that his name `may hold front there in the world.' 

	|66.~  The sinner replies that if he thought he were
speaking to one who would return to the world, he would tell him
nothing, but since return is impossible he can answer `without
fear of infamy.'  In the upper Circles the souls do not shrink
from this remembrance upon earth, but in these shameful depths of
Fraud and Treachery it would be a relief to be forgotten. 
Besides, this soul had left behind him on earth a name so great
and honoured that Dante himself, in the ^Convito~ (iv. 28),
speaks of him as `our most noble Latian'; and if he thought that
the sin he was about to confess was unknown on earth, we can
understand why he shrank from ruining his reputation by revealing
it.

	|67-72.~  He then tells Dante the strange story of his
life -- the story of a soul lost within sight of Heaven's gate, a
ship wrecked at the harbour's mouth.  His name -- which, however,
he is careful not to speak -- was Guido, Count of Montefeltro, a
district, as he says, `between Urbino and the yoke from which the
Tiber bursts.'  He was Captain of the Ghibellines in Romagna, and
more than once had fought against the Pope and been
excommunicated. 

	|73-78.~  Count Guido's own account of himself here is
far less flattering than the reputation which he left behind on
earth:

     			   `My deeds
     Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
     The cunning wiles and covert ways,
     I knew them all, and practised so their art,
     That to the ends of the earth the sound went forth.'

     [Comp. Machiavelli's ^Prince~, cap. xviii., ^Whether 
     princes ought to be faithful to their engagements~: 
     `Now as a prince must learn how to act the part of a
     beast sometimes, he should make the fox and the lion
     his patterns....  From the fox, a prince will learn
     dexterity in avoiding snares; and from the lion, how to
     employ his strength to keep the wolves in awe.  But they who
     entirely rely upon the lion's strength, will not always meet
     with success: in other words, a prudent prince cannot and
     ought not to keep his word, except when he can do so without
     injury to himself, or when the circumstances under which he
     contracted the engagement still exist.']

This reputation for cunning proved in the end his eternal
undoing.  His repentance and confession would have availed for
his salvation, had not Boniface VIII. `brought him back to his
first sins.' 

	|79-84.~  At last, in old age, when, as he says,

     			   `every one ought
     To lower sails and gather in the ropes,'

he made his peace with the Church, repented, confessed, and
joined the Franciscan Order.  From the sequel we might suspect
that he was of the number of those described by Milton,

     		`who, to be sure of Paradise,
     Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
     Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised.'
     [^Par. Lost~, iii. 478-480.]

Dante, however, seems to give him full credit for sincerity in
his repentance; as we have seen he calls him `our most noble
Latian,' and praises him for lowering the sails of his worldly
affairs as he drew near to the port of death [^Conv.~ iv. 28]. 
Benvenuto da Imola says that he was often seen publicly begging
his bread in Ancona, where he died and was buried; and that he
had heard many things of him which gave good hope of his
salvation. 

	|85-111.~  That `Prince of the new Pharisees' sought the
advice of so crafty a fox under the following circumstances.  In
the year 1297 the Pope was carrying on a war, not, as Guido
sarcastically says, against Saracens or Jews, but against
Christians -- the great rival house of the Colonnas.  Two
Cardinals of this family, being excommunicated by Boniface and
their palaces in Rome destroyed, retired to their stronghold of
Palestina.  Foiled and furious at his inability to capture this
place, the Pope summoned the crafty old soldier-monk from his
cloister to advise him how to raze it to the ground.  At first
Guido kept silent, for Boniface seemed delirious with `the fever
of his pride'; but on being promised absolution by anticipation,
he gave th evil counsel which sank him to this Moat:

     	   `"Father, since thou washest me
     Of that sin into which I now must fall,
     The promise long with the fulfilment short,
     Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."'

Following this advice, Boniface promised the Cardinals that if
they submitted, he would grant them pardon and restore their
possessions; his fulfilment was `short' enough -- he levelled
Palestrina with the ground.  Six years later the Colonnas took
their revenge for this treachery by the famous outrage on
Boniface at Anagni, and it is perhaps in sarcastic allusion to
this that Guido promises he will `triumph in his lofty seat' by
following his advice [^Purg.~ xx. 86-90.  For a defence of
Boniface, see Father Bowden's Preface to Hettinger, p. xiii. 
Milman says of him: `He was hardly dead when the epitaph was
proclaimed to the unprotesting Christian world: He came in like a
fox, he ruled like a lion, and he died like a dog']. 

	|112-129.~  It was only in death that Count Guido awoke
from the delusion of salvation with which the Papal pardon had
lulled him to perdition.  Then St. Francis came, according to the
belief of the time, to claim his soul as one of his Cordeliers,
but was waved away by `one of the Black Cherubim.'  The passage
is too vigorous to be left unquoted:

     `Francis came afterwards, when I was dead,
     For me, but one of the Black Cherubim
     Said to him: "Take him not, do me no wrong;
     He must come down amongst my menials,
     Because he gave the fraudulent advice,
     From which time forth I have been at his hair:
     For who repents not cannot be absolved,
     Nor can one repent and will at once,
     Because of the contradiction which consents not."
     O miserable me! how I did waken up
     When he seized on me, saying to me: "Perchance
     Thou didst not think that I was a logician!"
     He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
     Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
     And, after he had bitten it in great fury,
     Said: "This is a sinner of the thievish fire";
     Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
     And vested thus in going I bemoan me.'

     [`The thievish fire' refers to xxvi. 41-42:

     	    Not one shows the theft,
     And every flame a sinner steals away.]

It was an axiom with Dante that there could be no salvation
without repentance; and it was morally impossible for Guido in
the one same act of will to resolve to commit a sin and to repent
of it.  In the ^De Monarchia~ he argues against the unlimited
power of the Pope to grant absolution.  When it is said,
`whatsoever thou shalt bind,' if the `whatsoever' is to be taken
in an absolute sense, `then,' says Dante, `he might even absolve
me when impenitent, which God Himself cannot do' [^De Mon.~ iii.
8].

	A number of writers regard the whole of this story as one
of those calumnies which grew up out of the mutual recriminations
of Guelphs and Ghibellines; and some declare it rests upon the
evidence of no contemporary writer.  As a matter of fact, the
story is told very much as Dante tells it in Villani's
^Chronicle~ (viii. 23); and as Villani was a Guelph, we may
suppose that he would not accept without evidence a story so
damaging to the character of the Pope.  If it is a calumny
invented by Dante, he would almost deserve a separate Circle for
himself.  It is inconceivable that in the very act of condemning
one sin of the tongue, he should deliberately commit another and
worse -- slander, and slander too of the defenceless dead.  The
fact that he praises `our most noble Latian' in the ^Convito~ for
lowering his sails in old age, proves nothing: it is surely no
inconsistency to praise a man for one act, while condemning him
for another.  Moreover, it is quite possible that the story of
this fraudulent counsel was unknown to Dante at the time when he
wrote the eulogistic passage in the ^Convito.~

	The mention of `one of the Black Cherubim' shows the
extraordinary exactness and care with which Dante carries out the
symbolism of his poem.  The Cherubim are the eighth Order of
Angles in the Heavenly Hierarchy, and doubtless that is why they
are mentioned in this eighth Bolgia of this eighth Circle.  But
the reason goes much deeper.  The sin punished in this Moat is
the abuse and perversion of great intellectual powers to
fraudulent ends.  Now, the Cherubim represent the intellectual
powers in their highest created form -- they are the Angels that
excel is knowledge [comp. ^Par.~ xi. 37-39, where St. Francis is
compared to Seraphim, burning with love, and St. Dominic to
Cherubim, shining with the light of wisdom:

     `The one was all seraphical in ardour,
     The other by his wisdom was on earth
     A splendour of cherubic light'];

and therefore Dante represents those who fell from this Order and
became Black Cherubim, as waiting for the souls of men whose sin
is intellectual like their own.  This too is probably the reason
why the fiend says that ever since Count Guido gave the
fraudulent counsel, he had been `at his hair' -- his hand, as it
were, clutching fast the head and brain which the sinner's own
craftiness had delivered into his power.

	It is impossible to pass by the awful and mysterious
contrast which Dante draws between the fate of Guido and that of
his son Buonconte, whom he meets shortly after on the lower
slopes of Mount Purgatory.  The one is a soul shipwrecked at the
very harbour's mouth; the other is a soul saved even when it
seemed to have struck and gone to pieces on the rocks of
perdition.  Buonconte was the leader of the Aretines at the
battle of Campaldino in 1289, at which it is thought Dante
himself was present.  Buonconte was slain, but his body was never
found; and out of this mysterious disappearance the poet, after
his manner, constructs an ideal ending of his life, as we have
just seen him do for Ulysses.  After the defeat of his forces, he
fled wounded in the throat across the plain to the point where
the Archiano joins the Arno, and there, murmuring the name of
Mary, fainted from loss of blood and died.  Any just as over his
father's soul the powers of good and evil contended for
possession, so, but with opposite issue, they fought for his.  It
was claimed and kept by God's angel, to the furious anger and
chagrin of the demon who had long made sure of it.  Enraged that
for `one poor little tear' he was thus cheated of the immortal
soul, he wreaked his vengeance on the mortal dust.  Gathering the
storm-clouds among the mountains, he swept the body down the
flood of the Arno, dashing it furiously along, and finally
burying it in the mud at the bottom of the river, so that it was
never found.  In this deliberately contrasted picture of father
and son, Dante seems to have had two aims in view.  In the first
place, he wished to show the tragic criticalness of human fate:
how slight the cause which may make the balance dip to Hell or
rise to Heaven -- the father lost when all seems safe, the son
saved when all seems lost.  In the ^Paradiso~ he uses the thought
to check rash judgments of our fellowmen:

     `Nor yet shall people be too confident
     In judging, even as he who counteth
     The corn in field ere ever it be ripe;
     For I have seen all winter long the thorn
     First show itself intractable and fierce,
     And after bear the rose upon its top;
     And I have seen a ship direct and swift
     Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,
     To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.'
     [^Purg.~ v. 85-129; ^Par.~ xiii. 130-138.]

In the next place, Dante evidently meant to point out some of the
limits of the Church's power in salvation.  On the one hand, even
the pardon of a Pope is a powerless to save a deliberate sinner
like Guido from Hell: without repentance God Himself could not do
it, much less His Vicar.  On the other hand, Buonconte's
salvation proved that the pardon did not depend on the Church, or
the intervention of sacraments, or priestly absolution: without
confession or shrift, viaticum or extreme unction, there among
the lonely hills the dying sinner's one cry of penitence saved
him in the very article of death.  So free of bondage even to the
appointed means is the grace of God.
