	|Proemio.~  Sensuality and Gluttony are Incontinence of the
body; we now come to Incontinence of goods.  Following Aristotle,
Dante regards this sin as consisting of two extremes: money may be
abused by holding it too greedily, or by squandering it too
lavishly.  Hence the Fourth Circle, into which the pilgrims now
descend, contains both Misers and Prodigals, sinners of the close
fist and of the open hand.  They are left and right of the selfsame
sin, Avarice. 

	|1.~  When Plutus saw the travellers approaching, he cried out
in his `clucking voice': 
 
     `Pape Satan, pape Satan, aleppe!' -- 
 
words which Virgil, `who knew all', may have understood, but 
which have never been satisfactorily explained.  Different 
commentators have regarded them as Hebrew, French, Greek, or 
Greek and Latin mixed.  We need not waste time over what appears 
to be an insoluble problem.  They seem to be meant as an 
intimidation to the pilgrims, or as a shout of warning to Satan, 
`the Emperor of the Kingdom dolorous,' that his realm is being 
invaded by a `living soul.'  It has been suggested that the cry 
is an intentionally obscure way of saying that the Pope was 
Satan; and, while there is no need to blind ourselves to this 
view, it is yet worth noting that the Church contributes to this 
Circle many shaven heads -- Popes and Cardinals being expressly 
named as those `in whom Avarice doth practice its excess' [^Inf.~ 
vii. 46-48].  

	|2.~  The Jailor of the Circle is Plutus, the Greek god of 
wealth, from which we have our familiar word plutocrat [`It is 
uncertain whether Dante intended ^Pluto~ to represent Pluto, 
otherwise called Hades, the god of the nether world,... or 
Plutus, the god of wealth....  It is probable that he did not 
very clearly distinguish between the two, since even in classical 
times they were sometimes identified' (Toynbee, ^Dante 
Dictionary~)].  As in the case of Minos, Dante degrades him into 
a demonic and brutal form.  In mythology he is represented 
variously, -- sometimes as a boy with a cornucopia, sometimes as 
a child carried in the arms of Fortune or of Peace.  Dante, 
however, will have nothing to do with this conception of the god 
of riches as a thing of childlike innocence, the companion of 
peace and plenty, but sinks him into an `accursed wolf' with 
`bloated lip.'  We saw that the fiercest of the three beasts 
which obstructed his ascent of the mountain was an old She-wolf; 
and on the Fifth Cornice of Purgatory the name is expressly 
applied to Avarice [^Purg.~ xx. 10].  This brutifying and 
demonizing of Plutus is the poet's way of stripping off the 
disguise of innocence and peace which wealth often wears, and 
revealing the wolf underneath.  The love of money is no harmless 
boy pouring out a horn of plenty, no sweet and innocent child 
borne in the arms of Peace: it is a beast of prey living upon 
others, `a root of all kinds of evil.' 
 
	|10-15.~  For all his outcry, a few words from Virgil quickly 
dispose of Plutus.  Commanding the `accursed wolf' to be silent, 
he says: 
 
     `Not causeless is our journey to the abyss; 
     Thus it is willed on high, there where Michael wrought 
     Vengeance upon the proud adultery.'  
                         [^Inf.~ vii. 10-12.] 
 
	The reference is, of course, to the defeat of the rebel 
angels, but it is not easy to see why it is brought in here, or 
why their revolt is called `the proud adultery.'  In Scripture 
any unfaithfulness to God is regarded as spiritual adultery. 
Virgil's meaning seems to be that covetousness is also spiritual 
unfaithfulness, the giving to material things the devotion which 
is due to God alone; and that He who avenged Himself on the one 
form of infedelity was able to avenge Himself on the other.  At 
the word, Plutus falls to the ground, 
 
     Even as the sails inflated by the wind 
     Together fall involved when snaps the mast; 
                         [^Inf.~ vii. 13-15.] 
 
perhaps to indicate the ease with which Reason disposes of wealth 
with its swelling pretensions and threats; or the terror with 
which the thought of God's judgment inspires men whose god is 
this world. 

	|22-30.~  Dante tells us that this Circle is the most densely 
populated in Hell: 
 
     Here saw I people many more than elsewhere. 
                         [^Inf.~ vii. 25.] 
 
Again and again he refers to the prevalance of this sin: the 
ability to spend money wisely, neither hoarding nor squandering, 
is far from common.  

	We come now to the punishment of this sin.  It consists in the
perpetual rolling of great weights round the Circle.  The Misers
roll to the left, the Prodigals to the right, until they meet and
clash together like billows on Charybdis [the comparison to
Charybdis is symbolic.  In the myth Charybdis was a voracious
woman, who stole oxen from Hercules, and was hurled by the
thunderbolt of Zeus into the sea.  The name was given to a rock
between Italy and Sicily.  There thrice a day she drank in the 
sea-waves, and thrice poured them out again.  Her greed in 
stealing the oxen and the fluctuations of the waves made her, in 
Dante's mind, symbolic of Avarice and its stormy tides].  When 
this encounter takes place, the two companies revile each other: 
the Prodigals crying, `Why hoardest thou?' -- the Misers 
retorting, `Why squanderest thou?'  Then the rival bands turn and 
roll their weights in the opposite directions, until the waves 
clash again: and thus through eternity they `dance their 
roundelay'.  The meaning is obvious.  It is the unrest which 
covetousness produces here, prolonged into another world. 
Aquinas says that one of `the daughters of Avarice' is 
restlessness; and we know it without his testimony.  The 
incessant toils which men undergo for money, the laborious days 
and sleepless nights, the dangers and privations they face: how 
truly they are symbolized in this perpetual rolling of heavy 
weights `by main-force of chest.'  In the ^Convito~ Dante dwells 
upon the burden of anxiety the mere possession of riches lays 
upon men, not to speak of the previous labour of acquisition: `It 
is the cause of evil, because it makes the possessor wakeful, 
timid and hateful.  How great fear is that of a man who knows he 
carries riches about him, in journeying, in resting, not only 
when awake but when sleeping, not only that he will lose his 
property.  Well do the miserable merchants know, who go about the 
world, that the leaves which the wind stirs make them tremble 
when they are carrying their riches with them; and when they are 
without it, full of confidence, singing and talking they make 
their journey shorter' [^Conv.~ iv. 13].  The clashing of the 
weights half round the Circle, and the taunts the two bands fling 
at each other, represent the constant ebb and flow of money 
between misers and prodigals, the way in which they act as a 
check on each other, and their mutual hatred and 
misunderstanding, each class thinking the other fools.  What 
Dante sees is that this toil and unrest do not cease with this 
present world.  If for a lifetime a man allows this restless 
passion to gain possession of his soul, the mere physical change 
of death will not cast it out; it is even possible it may 
increase its power.  The man has entered a world in which no gold 
exists, while the thirst for it burns on, the restless, 
resistless habit of a lifetime.  For that toil and buffeting, 
therefore, which Dante puts in this symbolic form, no Hell beyond 
the man himself is necessary: he has that within his own soul 
which will not let him rest.  Truly does Virgil say: 
 
     `All the gold that is beneath the moon, 
     Or ever has been, of these weary souls 
     Could never make a single one repose.' 
                         [^Inf.~ vii. 64-66.] 
 
And the reason is the simple one that these souls have given to 
gold the passion and devotion meant for God Himself, as Dante 
tells us in a fine passage in the ^Convito~: `And since God is 
the beginning of our souls and the maker of them like unto 
Himself, as it is written, "Let us make man in our image and 
likeness," this soul desires above all things to return to Him. 
And even as a pilgrim who goes by a way he has never travelled, 
who believes every house he sees from afar to be his inn, and not 
finding it to be so directs his faith to the next, and so from 
house to house till he comes to the inn; so our soul the moment 
that it enters on the new and never-travelled path of this life, 
directs its eyes to the goal of its Highest Good, and therefore 
whatever thing it sees which appears to have in itself any good, 
believes that it is it.  And because its first knowledge is 
imperfect through want of experience and teaching, small goods 
appear to it great; and therefore it begins first to desire 
those.  Whence we see little children desire above all things an 
apple; and then, proceeding further on, desire a little bird; and 
then, further on, desire a beautiful garment; and then a horse, 
and then a wife; and then riches, not great, then great, and then 
very great.  And this happens because in none of these things 
does it find that which it goes in search of, and it thinks to 
find it further on' [^Conv.~ iv. 12; comp. iii. 15].  Now, in 
this search the covetous soul has stopped short at riches as its 
Highest Good; but being created to find its Highest Good in God 
alone, is tormented by an eternal restlessness. 

	|37-39.~  But what evidently surprises him most is the 
prevalence of this abuse of money among the clergy.  On the left 
hand, and therefore among the Misers, he sees many tonsured 
hands, and is informed by Virgil that they belong to clerks, 
Popes, and Cardinals, `in whom Avarice practises its excess.'  St. 
Thomas Aquinas, discussing Prodigality, says it is a sin against a 
man's self, and also against his neighbour, since it squanders 
the goods out of which he ought to provide for others.  `And this 
appears most of all in clerics, who are dispensers of the goods 
of the Church, which belong to the poor, and the poor they 
defraud by their prodigal expenditure' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxix. 
a. 3].  It seems to have been Dante's belief that Miserliness 
was a greater temptation to churchmen than the more generous sin 
of spending too freely.  It is a curious question why the very 
men who by their calling profess to have forsaken the world, are 
notoriously in bondage to it.  Perhaps the conjecture of an old 
commentator is not far from the truth: `I own I cannot find a 
cause for avarice in prelates, unless it be that perchance 
prohibition engenders concupiscence' [Benvenuto da Imola, quoted 
by Vernon (^Readings on Inferno~, i. 217)]. 

	Let us now examine somewhat more carefully the sin of 
this Circle.  As we saw, it is abuse of one's goods, and this 
abuse takes two opposite forms -- Miserliness and Prodigality, 
greed in hoarding and recklessness in spending.  These are placed 
in the same Circle because they are at root the same greed of 
gold: for greed is greed whether its ultimate object be to hoard 
or to squander.  The idea is taken from Aristotle's ^Ethics.~  The 
liberal man is one who stands free of the evils of both extremes, 
giving the right amount, at the right time, to the right persons, 
and in the right spirit.  The illiberal or miserly man is he who 
breaks these conditions of right giving by deficiency, as the 
prodigal breaks them by excess.  Dante, it is to be noticed, 
indicates that Miserliness is the worse by setting it on the left 
hand; and in this estimate he follows both Aristotle and Aquinas. 
The latter gives three reasons why Prodigality is the lesser sin. 
In the first place, its is more akin to liberality, being an 
excess of giving.  `Secondly, because the prodigal is useful to 
many, to whom he gives; but the miser to none, not even to 
himself.  Thirdly, because the prodigal is easy to cure, as well 
by the approach of old age, which is contrary to prodigality, as 
by his easily sinking into poverty through his many useless 
expenses, and thus impoverished, he cannot run to excess in 
giving; and also because he is easily brought to virtue by the 
likeness that he bears to it.  But the miser's is no easy cure.' 
Indeed, Aristotle declares that illiberality is incurable because 
it runs in human nature, and because old age and impotence of any 
kind only increase it [^Ethics~, iv. 1, 2, 3; ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. 
cxix. a. 3]. 
 
	On the other hand, Dante knew well that there is a danger 
of exalting Prodigality into a virtue.  There is frequently about 
a spendthrift a certain open-handed `generosity,' which hides the 
evil of his life; and of this an instance is given in the 
^Purgatorio.~  On the corresponding Terrace there he meets the 
poet Statius, whose besetting sin had been Prodigality.  But the 
time was when he had not recognized it as a sin: what opened his 
eyes, he tells Virgil, was a passage from his writings: 
 
     `When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest 
     As if indignant against human nature, 
     "Through what dost thou not drive, O cursed hunger 
     Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?"... 
     Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide 
     Their wings in spending.'  

     [^Purg.~ xxii. 38-44.  The reference is to
     Virgil's `Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra fames!'
     (^AEn.~ iii. 56, 57).  ^Sacra~ is sometimes taken in a good
     sense, `O hallowed hunger of gold.'] 
 
In other words, Statius learned that the spendthrift is cursed 
with the `hunger of gold' as surely as the miser, and that it 
often drives him into the same unscrupulous ways of satisfying 
it.  Probably Dante had in his mind the following passage from 
Aristotle's ^Ethics~: `Most prodigals not only give to the wrong 
people, but take from the wrong sources, and are so far 
illiberal.  They become grasping because they are eager to spend, 
and are not able to do so easily, as their means soon run short; 
they are therefore obliged to get the means from other sources. 
At the same time, as nobleness is a matter of indifference to 
them, they are reckless and indiscriminate in their taking; for 
they are eager to give but do not care at all how they give, or 
how they get the means of giving' [^Ethics~, iv. 3].  In the 
^Convito~ there is a passage in which Dante indignantly denounces 
this `generosity' with ill-got gains: `Is this any other,' he 
asks sarcastically, `than to steal the cloth from the altar, to 
cover with it both the thief and his table?' [^Conv.~ iv. 27.] 
 
	Before passing on, let us note that another and darker 
form of this sin of Prodigality is punished in a lower Circle, 
that of the Violent against Themselves.  There Dante sees 
spendthrifts who virtually committed suicide by a wild and 
reckless squandering of the very means of life, hunted and torn 
throughout eternity by the hounds of their own insane prodigality 
[^Inf.~ xiii. 109-129]. 
 
	In similar fashion, he distinguishes various forms and 
degrees of the sister-sin of Avarice.  In the three lowest 
Circles we shall find Userers, Simoniacs, Barrators, and Judas 
who sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver.  Plainly all are 
avaricious, and in not setting them in this upper Circle Dante is 
once more following Aristotle, who distinguishes various kinds of 
qualities of Covetousness.  There are men who are mere 
skinflints, not coveting the property of others, but simply 
determined not to part with their own.  Others do indeed covet 
what belongs to their fellows, but are restrained from taking it 
by fear.  Still others so far break through such restraints that 
they engage in dishonourable and evil callings for love of 
wealth, such as `usurers who lend small sums of money at 
extortionate rates of interest.'  In short, Dante recognizes two 
distinct qualities of Covetousness which differ widely in their 
degrees of guilt.  One is simple inability so to control our 
possessions that we neither grasp them too firmly nor throw them 
away with too free a hand.  The other allies itself with 
Violence, Fraud and Treachery, becomes therefore a sin againt 
Society, and for this reason is plunged into deeper abysses of 
perdition. 

	|52-54.~  There is in the punishment of the Covetous a second 
element which is very curious and interesting: they have grown 
unrecognizable.  As he views the vast crowd, Dante thinks that 
here, as elsewhere in the Inferno, he ought to know some of them, 
but Virgil says: 
 
                    `Vain thoughts thou gatherest: 
     The undiscerning life, which made them sordid, 
     Now makes them unto all discernment dark.' 

The meaning may be that the pursuit of money leaves a man without 
name or fame on earth: it is a mean and sordid life which has no 
claim upon men's memories.  But I incline to think that Dante's 
thought goes deeper, and refers to the effect of the love of 
money on the man himself.  Is not the idea this, that the 
exclusive pursuit of money has some peculiar power of blotting 
out a man's individuality, and making him one of a vast 
indistinguishable crowd, all stamped with the same base image and 
superscription?  And probably Dante is right.  To change the 
figure slightly, as coins by constant circulation lose the sharp 
image and superscription with which they left the mint, so this 
sin, through long years of commerce with the world, wears away 
the individual stamp of the soul.  Dante seems to have been 
greatly impressed with this idea.  Afterwards, when he reaches 
the Usurers in Circle VII., he says, `Not one of them I knew' 
[^Inf.~ xvii. 54.]; he recognized them only by the coats of arms 
painted on their money-bags.  In fine, excessive love of money 
destroys individuality -- that special difference of man from man 
which makes recognition possible.  The sordid herd of money-makers
grow as like as penny to penny; or rather, the original and
individual stamp is worn away, like coins too long in circulation
in the markets of the world. 
 
	|56-57.~  Finally, Dante tells us that at the Ressurection the
bodies of these sinners will bear the marks of their earthly 
life: 
 
     `These from the sepulchre shall rise again 
     With the fist closed, and these with hair shorn off.' 
 
     [The same reference to shorn tresses occurs in ^Purg.~ xxii. 46.] 
 
Obviously the closed fist is the sign of the Misers, and the 
shorn hair of the Prodigals, though the latter is not easy to 
understand.  Vernon thinks the idea is that `he who throws his 
life away, and does not use it either for his wants or his good 
name, is like one shorn of his hair, which is given as a natural 
adornment' [^Readings on the Inferno~, i. 218 n.]; but this seems 
forced.  It is much more probable that Dante wishes to mark the 
extreme to which the prodigal temper will go: these spendthrifts 
had not only squandered all their property, but had, so to speak, 
sold their very hair to gratify their passion for giving.  There 
is, indeed, an Italian proverb which speaks of a prodigal as one 
who `squanders even to his hair.'  The point of interest, 
however, is Dante's conviction that our very bodies in the world 
to come will bear the brands of the master-passion we have served 
here.  The `closed fist' and the `shorn hair' represent to his 
mind the natural and inevitable correspondence of the `spiritual 
body' to the spiritual state, the character which the earthly 
life has wrought within the soul. 
 
	|61-96.~  The restless doom of these shades suggests a
discourse on Fortune and her Wheel, a subject which seems to have
had a peculiar fascination for mediaeval minds [^Inf.~ vii.
61-96].  As they watch the ceaseless tides of hoarding and spending
meet and break like billows on Charybdis, Virgil says to Dante: 
 
     `Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce 
     Of the goods that are committed unto Fortune, 
     For which the human race each other buffet.' 
 
Whereupon Dante puts to him the question: 
 
     `What is this Fortune which thou hintest of, 
     That has the world's goods so within its clutches?' 
 
The word `clutches' indicates clearly enough Dante's own view. 
To him Fortune was a kind of wild beast, a cruel, arbitrary force 
like the heathen Fate, in whose claws man lies helpless.  There 
was, in truth, in his own fortunes and misfortunes much to 
justify such a belief; and there was certainly a time when he 
regarded the distribution of this world's goods as based upon no 
principle of justice.  In the ^Convito~ he writes of riches: `I 
say that their imperfection can be observed firstly in the 
indiscriminateness of their coming, in which no distributive 
justice shines forth, but perfect iniquity almost always.'  He 
proceeds to prove that whether riches come by chance, as in the 
discovery of hidden treasures, or by succession or will, or by 
work, whether lawful or unlawful, they come oftener to the wicked 
man than to the good [^Conv.~ iv. 11].  In short, Dante was 
assailed when he wrote the ^Convito~ by that doubt which finds its 
highest expression in the Book of Job -- doubt of the justice of 
God, in face of the sufferings of the good and the prosperity of 
the wicked.  In the passage before us he avails himself of the 
opportunity of retracting his earlier opinion, for which Virgil 
gives him a sharp rebuke: 
 
                         `O creatures imbecile, 
     How great is that ignorance which makes you stumble! 
     Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.' 
 
And his judgment -- the judgment of Reason -- is this.  Fortune, 
so far from being some wild beast of Chance or Fate, is `a 
general ministress and guide' appointed by God over all earthly 
things.  As He set the various orders of angels over the heavenly 
bodies to the end that the light may be equally distributed, and 
`every part to every part may shine' [for the Angelic Hierarchies 
and their relation to the Nine Heavens, see ^Convito~, bk. ii., 
particularly chap. vi., and ^Par.~ xxviii.], so he set Fortune 
over `the worldly splendours' for the same purpose of impartial 
distribution: 
 
     `That she might change betimes the empty goods 
     From people to people, and from one blood to another, 
     Beyond the resistance of all human wisdom. 
     Therefore one people rules and another languishes 
     In pursuance of the decree of her, 
     Which hidden is, as in the grass the serpent.' 
 
	As a god she rules her kingdom, inscrutable to human 
wisdom, incessant and swift in her changes.  Cursed by those who 
ought to praise her, she heeds it not, but turns her sphere and 
with bliss fulfils her appointed task.  This is an obvious 
personification of the Christian idea of Providence; indeed, in 
the ^De Monarchia~, it is expressly said that Fortune is better 
and more rightly called the Providence of God [^De Mon.~ ii. 
10].  What men call Fortune is neither a blind Chance nor an 
iron Fate.  The tides of prosperity and adversity ebb and flow at 
the bidding of One `whose wisdom trancends all,' and every 
fluctuation of Fortune works out some blissful end.  It is the 
conclusion reached by Boethius in his ^Consolation of 
Philosophy~, which it is evident was much in Dante's mind when 
writing this passage.  After a long discussion, Boethius argues 
that `all fortune is good,' and `for this reason a wise man 
should never complain, whenever he is brought into any strife of 
fortune; just as a brave man cannot properly be disgusted 
whenever the noise of battle is heard, since for both of them 
their very difficulty is their opportunity, -- for the brave man 
of increasing his glory, for the wise man of confirming and 
strengthening his wisdom....  It rests in your own hands what shall
be the nature of the fortune which you choose to form for 
yourself.  For all fortune which seems difficult, either 
exercises virtue, or corrects or punishes vice....  When the earth 
is overcome, the stars are yours' [^De Consolatione~, bk. iv]. 
It is worth while noting that Dante's first friend,' Guido 
Cavalcanti, has a ^Song of Fortune~ so like the passage before us 
that, as Longfellow says, `one might infer that the two friends 
had discussed the matter in conversation, and afterwards that 
each had written out their common thought.'  It is too long to 
quote entire, but the verse may be given in which the poet 
rebukes the complaints against Fortune to which Dante refers: 
 
     `Ye make great marvel and astonishment 
       What time ye see the sluggard lifted up 
         And the just man to drop, 
       And ye complain on God and on my sway. 
     O humankind, ye sin in your complaint: 
       For He, that Lord who made the world to live, 
         Lets me not take or give 
       By mine own act, but as He wills I may. 
       Yet is the mind of man so castaway, 
     That it discerns not the supreme behest. 
         Alas! ye wretchedest, 
     And chide ye at God also?  Shall not He 
     Judge between good and evil righteously?' 
 [Rossetti's Translation in ^Dante and his Circle~, 168-171.] 
 
	|100-108.~  We have seen Incontinence in two forms --
non-control of body and of goods; we now go deeper into human
nature and reach the more spiritual form of non-control of temper. 
The very hour hints that we are approaching a darker evil: the
stars are sinking -- it is past midnight.  Further, the whole
scenery changes, to indicate that we have come to another order of
sin.  Down to this point the pilgrims were moving on a series of
terraces, ranged one beneath the other, like the tiers of an
amphitheatre.  Now they reach the second of the great rivers of the
lost world.  On the inner edge of the Circle of Avarice, they come
upon a fountain of dark and boiling waters, which pour down a
channel which they have wrought for themselves, and spread out into
the great Marsh of Styx.  In the centre of this Stygian fen rise
the walls and towers of the City of Dis, to which it forms a vast 
moat.  In this Marsh are punished two forms of sinful Anger: hot, 
passionate anger, quick to lift the hand; and sulky, sullen, 
melancholy resentment.  The former, as the lighter sin, is 
punished on the surface of the fen; the latter, in the mire at 
the bottom. 
 
	The Marsh of Styx is an obvious symbol of the sin of this 
Circle.  Dante tells us that the boiling spring which formed it 
was in colour `darker far than perse,' and elsewhere he says 
`perse is a colour composed of purple and black, but the black 
predominates' [^Conv.~ iv. 20].  We can scarcely be mistaken in 
seeing in the boiling spring the boiling of angry passions; and 
in the black waters the way in which those passions darken and 
defile the pure stream of life.  In the ^Purgatorio~ we find 
Anger punished by a fog which bites and blinds the eyes, symbolic 
of the way in which angry passions cloud and distort the reason 
[^Purg.~ xv. 142-xvi. 15].  Here too there is a fog which rises 
as an exhalation from the fen; but also there is inflicted a more 
terrible blindness, represented by the mire into which the souls 
are plunged. 
 
	|112-114.~  As we saw, the quick passionate form of Anger is
punished on the surface of the Marsh.  From `the grey malignant
shores' the travellers see the souls of the Wrathful smiting each
other with hands and head, breast and feet, and even tearing one 
another in pieces with their teeth.  Their punishment is 
threefold.  In the first place, they are obviously abandoned to 
their own passions: on earth for a lifetime they gave them free 
rein, and now they are completely beyond their control and rage 
on in intensified fury.  In the second place, the mire blinds 
them.  `The anger of zeal,' says Gregory, `troubles the eye of 
reason, but the anger of vice quite blinds it.'  And finally, the 
mire defiles as well as blinds.  Dante calls the souls here `a 
muddy people,' and says that they `gorge the mud.'  He is 
probably thinking of the foul language with which the passion of 
anger fills the mouth.  Aquinas says `the daughters of Anger' are 
six: `brawling, swelling of spirit, contumely, clamour, 
indignation, and blasphemy'; indeed he goes further, declaring 
that `irascibility is the gate of all vices: when that is shut, 
rest will be given to the virtues within: when that is open, the 
spirit will sally forth to the commission of all crime' [^Summa~, 
ii-ii. q. clviii. a. 6, 7]. 
 
	|121-124.~  When we turn to the second class of sinners
punished in this Circle, we find considerable controversy as to
what precisely they are.  As the pilgrims skirt the margin of the 
Marsh, Virgil points out to Dante the bubbles which rise 
everywhere on the surface of the water, and informs him that they 
are made by a doleful `hymn' which souls fixed in the mire below 
gurgle in their throats: 
 
     `Fixed in the slime they say: "Sad were we 
     In the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened, 
     Bearing within ourselves the slothful smoke: 
     Now are we sad in the black mire."'
                         [^Inf.~ vii. 117-126.] 
 
Some commentators, on the strength of the words `slothful smoke' 
(^accidiso fummo~), regard the sin as that of Sloth (^Accidia~), 
identifying it with that punished on the Fourth Cornice of 
Purgatory.  Others, laying the emphasis on the sadness of these 
sinners, take their sin to be, as Dr. Moore says, `a type or 
species of anger, viz., sullen, suppressed, or sulky anger; a 
gloomy, resentful, discontented disposition, refusing to rejoice 
in the bright sunshine, and other occasions of happiness and 
contentment in this upper world.'  Dr. Moore thinks, I have no 
doubt rightly, that Dante had in mind Aristotle's distinction 
between sullenness and other forms of anger of a more explosive 
kind [^Studies in Dante~, second series, 175].  It is an anger 
into which enter both sloth and sadness, as Dante plainly 
indicates.  In this, indeed, he is simply following Aquinas: 
`Sloth,' he says, `is a heaviness and sadness, that so weighs 
down the soul that it has no mind to do anything.  It carries 
with it a disgust of work.  It is a torpor of the mind neglecting 
to set about good.  Such sadness is always evil.'  He adds that 
Sloth is a mortal sin because it is contrary to charity: `for the 
proper effect of charity is joy in God: while sloth is a sadness 
at spiritual good, inasmuch as it is divine good' [^Summa~, ii-ii.
q. xxxv. a. 1, 3].  As the word ^accidia~ means, it is the 
feeling of ^don't care~: a sullen, lazy, angry discontment which 
can take an interest in nothing, not even in the shining of the 
sun.  And when we remember where this sin was most prevalent in 
the Middle Ages, we will not think it an accident that Dante 
calls the words these sinners gurgle in their throats a `hymn.' 
An old commentator remarks shrewdly that priests, whose duty it 
was to chant hymns in church, were so lazy that they would not 
even stand to sing praises to God, and that they do not pronounce 
the words articulately, but, as Dante says, gurgle them in their 
throats.  Bishop Martensen says this weariness of life, called 
^acedia~ in the Middle Ages, was `a state of soul that often 
occurred in monasteries, that is, in such as gave themselves to a 
one-sidedly contemplative life, without having the power or the 
calling for it, and who were filled with a disgust of all things, 
even of existence, while even the highest religious thoughts 
became empty and meaningless to them' [^Christian Ethics~ 
(Individual), p. 378.  See discourse on `Accidie' in Chaucer's 
^The Parson's Tale~].  Lecky, in his ^History of European 
Morals~, affirms that `most of the recorded instances of 
mediaeval suicides in Catholicism were by monks,' and traces 
them to this ^acedia~, `a melancholy leading to desperation.'  It 
is by no means unlikely that this is what Dante hints at in the 
work `hymn': it is the somewhat sullen, morose, and melancholy 
lack of interest in anything, to which men are specially liable 
who embrace the religious life, without having any true vocation 
for it [Alban Butler in his Life of St. Bruno says: `Gaiety of 
soul (which always attends virtue) is particularly necessary in 
all who are called to a life of perfect solitude, in which 
nothing is more pernicious than sadness'].  The punishment which 
Dante assigns to this sin is by no means so arbitrary or 
fantastic as it may at first glance look.  On earth they darkened 
for themselves the sweet air made gladsome by the sun, with `the 
slothful smoke' of their sad and sullen temper; and now the 
`smoke' has intensified into black mire, in which they are 
embedded throughout eternity.  In other words, a lifelong habit 
of morose and melancholy refusal to see the sunshine which exists 
even in the darkest lot, may well become at last the fixed and 
unalterable temper of the soul.  It reminds us of the words from 
the ^Wisdom of Solomon~, which perhaps were in Dante's mind; `For 
the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in 
their labour: over them only was spread an heavy night, an image 
of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet 
were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness' [Chap. 
xvii. 20, 21].  We can scarcely doubt that Dante had a personal 
interest in thus vividly realizing to himself the doom of such 
souls, when we remember that his own circumstances must have been 
a constant temptation to him to give way to this sad and sullen 
spirit.  Exiled from his native city, accused of a disgraceful 
crime, learning by long and bitter experience 
 
                    `how savoureth of salt 
     The bread of others, and how hard a road 
     The going down and up another's stairs,'  
                         [^Par.~ xvii. 58-60.] 
 
Dante yet seems to have kept within his breast a heart open to 
the sunshine.  `Can I not everywhere behold the mirrors of the 
sun and of the stars?' [^Epis.~ ix. 4] he asks in his letter of 
indignant refusal to return to Florence on conditions which were 
an insult to an innocent man.  In the ^Convito~, he sets it down 
as one of the marks of noble Age that it looks back with joy upon 
an active and well-spent life: `And the noble soul blesses also 
at this age the times past, and well may she bless them; because, 
revolving them in memory, she remembers her upright works, 
without which she could not come to the port to which she draws 
near, with so great riches nor with so great gain.  And she does 
as the good merchant, who, when he comes near to his port, 
examines his cargo, and says, If I had not passed through such a 
road, I should not have this treasure, and I should not have that 
therewith I shall rejoice in my city, to which I am approaching; 
and therefore he blesses the journey which he has made' [^Conv.~ 
iv. 28].
