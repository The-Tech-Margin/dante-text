	|1-3.~  We come now to the Second Circle of Hell -- the first
in which any positive sin is punished.  The sin is Sensuality, or
Luxury in the mediaeval sense of that word; and in order to
understand why it is placed here at the top as the least heinous,
it may be well to remind ourselves of Dante's classification of
sins already referred to.  He divides sins into two great classes: 
Incontinence and Malice.  To this uppermost section of the 
Inferno he assigns the sins of Incontinence in four or possibly 
five Circles, deepening, and also narrowing, according to their 
guilt.  They are set here in the highest section because they are 
sins of mere want of self-control -- sins of the individual man 
against the various parts of his own life and nature, by excess 
or defect.  If he cannot control his bodily appetites and 
passions, we have the sins of Sensuality and Gluttony, as in 
Circles II. and III.  If he cannot control his goods, we have the 
twin-sins of Miserliness and Prodigality, which, being ethically 
the same, are placed together in Circle IV.  Passing deeper into 
the man, if he cannot control his spirits and temper, we have the 
twofold sin of Anger, an excess of temper, and sullen Sadness, a 
defect of it; and these occupy Circle v.  We shall see that 
Circle VI. is one of transition between upper and nether Hell, 
having relations to both; meantime we may regard it as the last 
of the sins of Incontinence, namely Heresy -- the lack of the due 
control of the Reason.  Thus we see in this classification 
Incontinence entering step by step into the deeper parts of human 
nature; beginning with the bodily appetites, it eats inward until 
the intellectual faculties are involved.  According to Dante, the 
lusts of the mind sink men to a deeper perdition than those of 
the flesh.  Separated from these by a great precipice are the 
sins of the lower Hell -- Malice in its three principal forms, 
Violence, Fraud, and Treachery.  While Incontinence is only the 
abuse of some normal power of human nature, and therefore for the 
most part an injury to the sinner himself, Malice is a social 
sin, having injury to others for its very end, and therefore 
`wins' greater `hate in Heaven' [^Inf.~ xi. 22-90]. 
 
	|4-6.~  The Guardian of this Second Circle is Minos.  As a
rule, the Warder of each Circle represents the sin which is
punished in it, but Minos is an exception.  Though he stands at the
entrance to the Circle of Sensuality, he is not a symbol of that
sin.  He is the Judge of Hell in general, and represents the
condemning power of an evil and guilty conscience.  Every lost soul
is compelled to appear before him and confess all his sins; 
whereupon Minos coils his tail round himself as many times as the 
number of the Circle to which he is to be thrust down, and 
immediately the guilty wretch is hurled to his place.  As already 
pointed out, Dante has changed Minos into a dog-demon with a 
tail: 
 
     There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls. 
 
The change must be deliberate and intentional, for Dante cannot 
have been ignorant of the noble and radiant figure of the Minos 
of mythology.  Originally a king and lawgiver of Crete, he is 
rewarded for his righteousness by being made the supreme Judge in 
Hades.  Plato tells us that Zeus appointed Rhadamanthus judge of 
the dead from Asia, and AEacus of the dead from Europe; `but to 
Minos I shall give the primacy, and he shall hold a court of 
appeal, in case either of the two others are in doubt.'  All have 
sceptres; `but Minos alone has a golden sceptre and is seated 
looking on, as Odysseus in Homer declares that he saw him: 
 
     "Holding a sceptre of gold, and giving laws to the 
     dead."'  [^Gorgias~, 524-526.] 
 
In the ^AEneid~ he is the judge of those condemned to death by 
false accusations, and although not royal as in Homer, is yet a 
grave and dignified figure [^AEneid~, vi. 430-433].  Why, 
then, has Dante degraded Minos into a monstrous and demonic form? 
Partly, doubtless, in obedience to the belief of his time that 
the beings of heathen mythology were not gods, as their 
worshippers thought, but demons, in accordance with Paul's words: 
`The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to 
demons, and not to God' [^1 Cor.~ x. 20].  But there can be 
little doubt that the principal reason is the one already stated. 
Dante wanted a symbol of the evil conscience of the lost, a 
figure which would represent the horrible and distorted 
conception of the justice of God, which is one of the chief 
punishments of the hardened and impenitent soul.  That this is 
the idea is evident when we compare Minos with the Angel who 
fulfils the same office of confessor at the Gate of St. Peter in 
the ^Purgatorio.~  He too is the symbol of Conscience, but of 
Conscience humbled, convicted, contrite.  Such a conscience sees 
the justice of God not as a demon but an angel -- an angel, 
indeed, whose face cannot be endured, and whose sword flashes 
with a blinding light, but still an angel [^Purg.~ ix. 73-132]. 
To the impenitent and despairing conscience, the same Divine 
justice appears a hideous demon, which turns on the sinner with 
cynical snarlings of contempt and fury. 
 
	|16-24.~  When Dante appears before him, Minos `leaves the act
of so great an office': that is, he passes no judgment on him as on
the others.  In other words, Dante's conscience does not condemn 
him as a finally impenitent sinner.  Nevertheless the very sight 
of Minos, who represents the judgment of the impenitent, warns 
him that the pilgrimage before him is full of danger: 
 
     `O thou that to this dolorous hostelry 
     Comest,' said Minos to me, when he saw me, 
     Leaving the practice of so great an office, 
     `Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest; 
     Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.' 
 
He in whom Dante trusted was Virgil or Reason; the warning 
therefore seems to mean that in the contemplation of sin and its 
penalties, it is possible to trust Reason too much.  Familiarity 
with sin is easy, `the amplitude of the entrance' is great, but 
the very contemplation of evil may leave unsuspected stains upon 
the soul.  And, indeed, Dante tells us that he found it so.  When 
he emerged on the shore of Mount Purgatory, Virgil had to wash 
his tear-stained face with morning dew in order to `uncover the 
hue which Hell had covered up' in him [^Purg.~ i. 121-129].  In 
the meantime, however, the answer which Virgil gives to Minos is 
that it is not in Reason alone that Dante puts his trust: this 
pilgrimage is ordained of Heaven, and therefore not undertaken in 
any pride of his own unaided intellect: 
 
     `It is so willed there where is power to do 
     That which is willed; and ask no further question.' 
 
	|28.~  We turn now to the punishment inflicted on the Sensual,
a punishment which, as with all the penalties of the Inferno, is 
meant by Dante to represent the natural and necessary fruit of 
the sin, in accordance with the principle, `Whatsoever a man 
soweth, that also shall he reap.'  The first penalty of a sensual 
life is darkness: 
 
     I came unto a place mute of all light. 
 
This, of course, is not peculiar to this Circle; darkness, as the 
natural symbol of evil, pervades the entire world of the lost. 
But what Dante wishes to indicate is that sensual sin produces 
its own special darkness.  By concentrating the whole nature on 
the flesh, and, as he puts it, `subjecting reason to appetite,' 
reason itself is destroyed, the feelings are hardened, and the 
very capacity of spiritual vision is lost.  Thus with this sin 
St. Paul joins the moral and intellectual blindness of the 
heathen world of his day: `being darkened in their understanding, 
being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance 
that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart: who 
being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work 
all uncleanness with greediness' [^Eph.~ iv. 18, 19].  Probably 
Dante had specially before his mind the treatment of the subject 
by St. Thomas Aquinas.  Luxury, says Aquinas, by the vehemence 
of its passions, `throws the higher powers, the reason and will, 
into very great disorder.'  Hence what he calls `the daughters of 
Luxury' are `blindness of mind, inconsiderateness, headlong 
haste, inconstancy, self-love, hatred of God, affection for the 
present world, horror or despair of the world to come' [^Summa~, 
ii-ii. q. 153, a. 5].  

	|31-33.~  For, according to Dante, this is the special torment
of this sin, that lust lives on when all hope of its gratification 
is dead.  This eternal restlessness of desire unsatisfied, Dante 
pictures under the figure of a whirlwind, which bellows like a 
sea in tempest, and sweeps the souls onward without hope of rest 
or even of less pain: 
 
     The infernal hurricane that never rests 
     Leads the spirits onward in its rapine; 
     Whirling and smiting, it distresses them. 
 
At first glance, indeed, this seems a lighter punishment than is 
assigned to the same sin in Purgatory.  Here it is the wind; 
there it is fire so intense that, in comparison, molten glass had 
been a grateful coolness [^Purg.~ xxvii. 49-51].  Yet if we once 
realize what this torment of the whirlwind is, we shall not think 
it small.  Even in the present life and world, it not 
infrequently happens that this sin grows into a wild hurricane of 
passion, before which reason is swept away like a straw, and the 
man is driven helplessly on long after the jaded senses have lost 
the power to enjoy.  It may be though that in another world where 
the flesh no longer exists, the passions of the flesh must of 
necessity subside; but Dante's conviction is far otherwise.  He 
thinks rather of the naked human soul, a whirlwind of lusts, 
bereft for ever of the means of gratifying them. In the 
^Purgatorio~, for example, he declares that whereas at death the 
powers of the flesh are `voiceless all,' the higher faculties are 
quickened into greater keenness: 
 
     `The memory, the intelligence, and the will  
     In action far more vigorous than before.'  
                         [^Purg.~ xxv. 79-84.] 
 
We have to think, then, not of a soul freed from its passions 
through the easy process of escape from the flesh by death, but 
rather of a soul whose memory, intelligence, and will have been 
steeped in sensuality, having those faculties quickened into 
keener activity at the very moment when the flesh, the means of 
their gratification, is stripped away.  Having sown the wind, it 
reaps the whirlwind.  It is, indeed, much the same idea as is set 
forth in Isaac Taylor's ^Physical Theory of Another Life.~  There 
it is argued that the present body acts as a curb on the passions 
by means of the physical exhaustion which they produce; and that 
when this `corporeal limitation' is removed in a future state, 
the moral faculties, whether good or evil, will attain an 
intensity and power of which meantime we have no conception 
[^Physical Theory of Another Life~, chap. xiii]. 

	|34-36.~  Probably too it is this `hatred of God' 
and `horror of the world to come,' of which he is thinking when 
he says of these sinners of the flesh: 
 
     When they arrive before the precipice, 
     There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments, 
     There they blaspheme the power divine.  
 
`The precipice' seems to mean the edge of the cliff above, from 
which, when Minos has pronounced judgment, they are hurled to 
their doom.  They hate God, as Aquinas says, and blaspheme Him 
for `forbidding the coveted pleasure'; and they shrink with 
horror and despair from a world where such pleasure is now for 
ever impossible. 
  
	|52-72.~  As Dante watches these wretched shades, he sees them
at first like a great flock of starlings in winter, whirled about
in confusion by the wind, `hither, thither, down, up.'  Then, as
the wind changes, it sweeps them out into a long line, like cranes 
`chanting forth their lays.'  As the stream floats past, Virgil 
points out and names the shades of lovers famous in classic and 
mediaeval story, `dames of eld and cavaliers.'  We may perhaps 
distinguish two groups. In the first are souls whose sensuality 
had been promiscuous, unbridled, utterly lawless, unredeemed by 
any touch of nobler feeling, such as Semiramis, and `Cleopatra 
the voluptuous.'  Semiramis, queen of Assyria, `made lust legal 
in her law,' referring to a statement of Orosius that she 
legalized the crime of incest.  It is probably for this that she 
heads the long procession.  It is not so easy to understand why 
Dido is named between Semiramis and Cleopatra: 
 
     `The next is she who killed herself for love, 
     And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus,' 
                         [^Inf.~ v. 61, 62.] 
 
her dead husband.  As a suicide, we might expect to find her in 
the weird Wood of Circle VII.  It has been suggested that the 
reason why she is not there is that to heathen minds suicide was 
not sinful, provided it was committed for some worthy cause. 
Passing from this, however, it seems certain that although Dante 
names Dido between Semiramis and Cleopatra, he has no intention 
of seeing her on the same low level of guilt.  They were women of 
unbridled licentiousness, whereas Dido's sin was a single guilty 
passion.  That this distinction is meant to be drawn by Dante is 
evident from the fact that he is careful to tell us that Paolo 
and Francesca `issued from the band where Dido is'; and obviously 
a single passion which unites two lovers in both time and 
eternity, however guilty it may be, is not to be put upon the 
level of a base and indiscriminate profligacy.  There are, then, 
two bands representing two widely different degrees of guilt: at 
the head of the one is Semiramis, of the other Dido.  Before 
passing from the subject, one is tempted to wonder why Dido is 
here, while AEneas reposes with the blameless souls of heroes on 
`the green enamel' of the meadow in the Circle above.  In the ^De 
Monarchia~ [^De Mon.~ ii. 3.  Comp. ^AEn.~ iv. 171-172], 
indeed, Dante expressly recognizes Dido as AEneas's second 
wife, declaring that he was `ennobled' by his three marriages, of 
which this second one related him to Africa, as the other two to 
Asia and Europe.  If she was his wife, it is difficult to see why 
she is in this Circle at all, and more difficult to understand 
why a marriage which `ennobled' AEneas should brand her with 
shame.  The silent indignation and hatred with which, according 
to Virgil, she meets AEneas in Hades, certainly seems nearer to 
his deserts [^AEn.~ vi. 450-476]. 
 
	Among the souls that `loved not wisely but too well,' 
Virgil points out Helen and Achilles, Paris and Tristan, with 
more than a thousand other shades `whom Love had parted from our 
life.'  To some of these -- perhaps because their love had a 
touch of nobleness in it -- there seem to come lulls in the 
storm, brief moments of respite from the agony of vain desire. 

	|73-142.~  The interest of many generations of readers has
centred itself on 
two of these souls who have the comfort, bitter-sweet, of not 
being separated even in Hell.  These are Paolo Malatesta and 
Francesca da Rimini, perhaps next to Dante and Beatrice the most 
familiar names in the whole poem [^Inf.~ v. 73-142].  It has 
been often pointed out that Francesca has the mournful 
distinction of being the only Christian woman in the ^Inferno.~ 
Indeed, in comparison with men, there are few women in it at all. 
It would almost seem as if Dante believed that goodness came more 
naturally and easily to women; or it may be due to that reverence 
for Womanhood which we see in his workship of Mary, Beatrice, and 
Lucia [this is the more remarkable as it is against the 
mediaeval feelings about women, if painting and sculpture are 
any guide.  `Characteristically enough, the procession waiting 
for judgment in Christian delineations of the scene consists 
almost entirely of women.  The notion that woman is, in an 
emphatic and peculiar sense, the ally and satellite of Satan 
originated in the legend of the fall of man, and was strengthened 
by the institution of sacerdotal celibacy' (Evans's ^Animal 
Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture~, 331-333)]. 
 
	Dante's attention is drawn to these two souls, because 
they go together, 
 
     And seem upon the wind to be so light. 
 
This need not be taken, as is sometimes done, as symbolic of 
lightmindedness; it is rather that their being together makes it 
easier for them to float on that wind of passion, -- it seems 
almost their native element.  Hence the comparison to doves which 
follows.  When Dante, moved by the intensity of his pity, calls 
them, they float towards him softly like doves `to the sweet 
nest': there was to him something soft, gentle, dove-like in the 
love which had brought them to `the woful pass.'  As we saw, they 
come `from the band where Dido is,' the nobler souls that have 
been mastered by a single guilty passion; and in the momentary 
lull of the tempest, we hear `a small flute-voice of infinite 
wail,' the voice of Francesca telling her sad story while her 
companion ceases not to weep.  What exactly that story was, it is 
not easy now to discover through the successive veils of romance 
which have been thrown over it.  The tale as thus popularly 
embellished is to this effect.  Francesca's marriage was a 
political one.  Her father, Guido Vecchio da Polenta, lord of 
Ravenna, in order to heal a feud between himself and the house of 
the Malatesta of Rimini, betrothed his beautiful daughter to 
Gianciotto, the second son of that family.  Now this Gianciotto 
being deformed, as his name implies -- `Cripple John' -- it was 
thought advisable to send to the betrothal his handsome brother 
Paolo as his proxy.  Naturally enought, the young girl fell in 
love with him, thinking he was the husband chosen for her, and 
from the first deception of which she was the victim sprang the 
whole tragedy which followed.  Some years after the husband 
surprised and slew them with his own hand.  According to some 
forms of the story, Paolo would have escaped through a trap-door, 
had not his shirt of mail caught upon a nail, whereupon Francesca 
seeing his danger threw herself between the brothers and 
received the stroke meant for her lover.  It is said that they 
were buried together just as they were, and that, three centuries 
later, on their tomb being opened, the silken garments in which 
they had been slain were found quite fresh. 
 
	It is an ungrateful task to discredit a romance which 
would set the conduct of these lovers in a comparatively 
favourable light; yet plain dates and facts leave us no 
alternative.  The marriage took place about the year 1275, when 
Dante was a boy of ten.  Paolo was already a married man.  The 
tragedy occurred about ten years after, probably in 1285; and at 
the time Francesca had a daughter of nine, and Paolo, who had 
been married for sixteen years, was the father of two sons. 
Under such circumstances, their sin was not one of romantic and 
inexperienced youth, as it is popularly supposed to have been. 
Yet one difficulty remains.  If these are the plain and somewhat 
commonplace facts, how comes it that Dante sets the story in a 
light so strangely pathetic and beautiful that we almost forget 
the sin in pity for the lovers' doom?  It certainly cannot have 
been because he did not know the facts.  The closing years of his 
life were spent under the protection of Francesca's nephew, Guido 
Novello, lord of Ravenna; and there he must have heard all that 
could be told of the tragedy.  Probably gratitude to his friend 
and host prompted him to throw round his kingswoman as favourable 
a light as possible.  Nevertheless this would not account for 
everything.  There is in Dante's whole treatment of the story a 
peculiar something which proves to my mind that, from all he 
knew, he did not regard it as the low and vulgar intrigue which 
such sins commonly are.  There was in it, in spite of its guilt, 
some nobler quality of love, which he strives to bring out. Take, 
for example, the words concering Love, which he puts into 
Francesca's lips: 
 
     `Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize, 
     Seized this man for the person beautiful 
     Which was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me. 
     Love, which to no loved one pardons loving, 
     Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly, 
     That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me. 
     Love has conducted us unto one death; 
     Ca,ina waiteth him who quenched our life!'  
                         [^Inf.~ v. 100-107.  Mark the repetition
of the word ^Love.~] 
 
	When Dante hears these words which declare that love in 
their case was no momentary fever of the senses, but an eternal 
bond of soul with soul, he bows his head so long that Virgil has 
to ask what he is thinking of.  His answer is: 
 
                              'Ah me! 
     How many sweet thoughts, how much desire, 
     Conducted these unto the woful pass!'  
                              [^Inf.~ v. 112-114.] 
 
It was no low passion to begin with; no evil was thought at 
first.  Slowly, unconsciously, Love led them to death by gentle 
gradations of sweet thoughts and fond desires.  In those fair 
dreaming days when Love was still pure and innocent, they had no 
suspicion, no sudden prophetic hint and flash, that sweet thought 
and fond desire would at last grow into this infernal hurricane 
of passion.  Dante wonders what it was that brought to an end the 
long sweet conflict and uncertainly of their `dubious desires'; 
and Francesca, weeping bitterly at the memory of the happy day, 
tells him it was the reading together of the mediaeval Romance 
of Lancelot and Guinevere: 
 
     `One day we reading were for our delight 
     Of Lancelot, how love did him enthrall. 
     Alone we were and without all suspicion. 
     Full many a time our eyes together drew 
     That reading, and changed the colour of our faces; 
     But one point only was it that o'ercame us. 
     Whenas we read of the much-longed-for smile 
     Being by such a noble lover kissed, 
     This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided, 
     Kissed me upon the mouth all trembling. 
     Galeotto was the book, and he who wrote it; 
     That day no farther did we read therein.' 
                         [^Inf.~ v. 127-138.] 
 
The reference to Galeotto is Dante's judgment on the mediaeval 
Romances of love.  Galeotto is sometimes confounded with Galahad; 
but Mr. Paget Toynbee has proved conclusively that the reference 
is to Gallehault in the Old French Romance of ^Lancelot du Lac~ 
[^Dante Studies and Researches~, 1-37].  He was the knight who 
acted as intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, and urged 
the Queen to give the kiss which was the beginning of their 
guilt.  Similarly the Romance itself had been ^their~ Gallehault 
-- the pander that led them to the fatal sin.  As already said, 
it is Dante's judgment concerning the evil influence of the 
Romances of love so popular in his day, and his warning to the 
writers of them: their guilt is greater and will set them in a 
much lower Circle. 
 
	Although one would gladly escape from the subject, it may 
be well to glance briefly at Dante's treatment of the kindred 
sins throughout the ^Commedia~, in order to have the whole range 
of his teaching before our minds.  In Circle VII., for example, 
we shall find those whose sensuality is unnatural, the sensuality 
of Sodom; and in the Circle beneath that again, panders and 
seducers, betrayers of women [^Inf.~ xvi., xviii].  They are 
thrust down to these lower depths because Dante recognizes about 
this sin, and he does about all the sins of Incontinence, that 
there is a form of it which is by comparison natural, and, if one 
may say so, honest, frank, and open; whereas there are other 
forms which involve the violation of Nature, and the basest 
betrayal of trust and love.  Whenever these elements of vileness 
enter into this sin, they rightly sink the soul to a far deeper 
perdition. 
 
	Passing to the ^Purgatorio~, we find the souls of 
penitent Sensualists on the last Terrace of the Mount, burning 
away their evil passions and habits by the fiery pain of parting 
with them [^Purg.~ xxv., xxvi].  Obviously Dante's meaning is 
that Sensuality is the last evil of which human nature is purged, 
and that even then the soul is saved only `so as by fire,' -- so 
tenacious is its grasp, and so burning is the pain of giving it 
up.  Probably the reason is the same as that which makes it the 
least heinous sin in Hell, namely, that it has a natural basis in 
the flesh.  For that reason it is the least guilty; for that 
reason it is also the most deeply rooted, the last of which the 
soul gets free.  Nay further, Dante declares that there is a very 
real sense in which the soul never gets free from it.  The third 
Heaven of Paradise is Venus, the symbol of the abode of Lovers. 
It lies, like the Moon and Mercury, within the shadow of the 
earth [^Par.~ ix. 118].  The meaning is that the shadow of this 
sin of earth, although forgiven and purged away, yet lies like a 
darkness upon the joy of Heaven itself.  What he wishes to tell 
us is that no man can give to sinful love a heart that was meant 
for the love of God, without permanently lessening the power of 
his soul to know the Divine light and rejoice in it; the sinful 
love lies like the shadow of earth upon his soul for ever. 
 
	So stern is Dante's judgment of this sin; and it is this 
very sternness which gives intensity to his pity for the victims 
of it, at least in its more open and natural form.  He sets it 
here in the highest Circle in which any sin is punished.  When he 
hears Francesca's story he weeps for pity, and at the close of it 
swoons and falls, `even as a dead body falls.'  He recognizes the 
faithfulness of these lovers to each other even in their guilty 
passion, and rewards it by leaving them the sad comfort of 
floating light upon the wind together.  Indeed, so strong is his 
sympathy with this sin throughout the poem, that we wonder what 
the reason is.  In the passage before us, for instance, we cannot 
but mark how much severer is the punishment which he measures out 
to the injured husband: Francesca foretells his doom: 
 
     `Ca,ina waiteth him who quenched our life,' 
 
Now, Ca,ina is that part of the lowest Circle in which traitors 
to their kin are frozen in a lake of ice.  It receives its name 
from Cain, the first fratricide; and perhaps this is why 
Gianciotto is consigned to it.  But was he a traitor to his wife 
and brother?  Were not ^they~ rather traitors to him?  Probably 
the reason why Dante condemns him to the Circle of Traitors is 
that he knew of some element of treachery in his conduct towards 
them, although it is unknown to us.  But passing this by, why 
does he set a sin like Treachery at the very bottom of Hell, and 
Sensuality at the top?  As already said, the reason seems to be 
that the latter is mere lack of control of a natural appetite, 
whereas the former is a base and underhand violation of the 
bounds of Nature's own creating.  If this is somewhat of a 
reversal of popular and ecclesiastical conceptions of morality, 
it is at least more in harmony with the warning to the priests 
and elders of Israel: `Verily I say unto you, That the publicans 
and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.'
