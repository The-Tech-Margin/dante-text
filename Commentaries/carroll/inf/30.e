	|25-30.~  At this point two souls come rushing upon the
scene -- `shadows pale and naked.'  They belong to the second of
the four classes, Falsifiers of the Person: those who on earth,
for some fraudulent end, assumed the person or character of
others.  Now, the punishment of this Falsification of Person is
insanity.  The two shades rush in, pale and naked, and biting
madly as a boar does when thrust forth from his sty -- perhaps
with an allusion to the rush of the swine when the demons entered
into them.  `That goblin,' Gianni Schicchi, as Griffolino calls
him, in the frenzy of his madness seized the wretched leper,
Capocchio, by the nape of the neck with his teeth, and dragged
him savagely along the ground on his belly.  The reason why he
fixes on him is probably that he was a mimic like himself.  The
punishment of this sin is in kind.  On earth these souls
personated others, thus divesting themselves of their own
personality; and now they are deprived of that personality for
ever.  For insanity may be regarded as the substitution of an
imaginary personality for the real.  Dante saw in the gift of
mimicry a great moral danger: it is a ready instrument of fraud,
and it involves a certain tampering with our own personal
identity.  `Did you never observe,' asks Socrates, `how
imitations, beginning in early youth, at last sink into the
constitution and become a second nature of body, voice and mind?'
[^Republic~, iii. 395].

	|37-41.~  One of the wretched pair is Myrrha, daughter of
Cinyras, King of Cyprus, who disguised herself as a stranger that
she might become, in Dante's words,

     Beyond all rightful love, her father's lover.

In his letter to the Emperor, Henry VII., Dante calls Florence '
the accursed and impious Myrrha'; the idea being that the city in
yielding herself so completly to her spiritual Father, the Pope,
was guilty of a species of spiritual incest [^Letter~ vii. 7.].

	|42-45.~  The other `shadow' is a certain Florentine,
Gianni Schicchi, of the family of the Cavalcanti.  The story of
his personation is peculiar.  Buoso Donati -- probably the same
as in the Moat of the Thieves in Canto xxv. 140 -- when he neared
the end of his sinful life was anxious to make for himself
friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness by leaving his
ill-got wealth to purposes of charity, and returning it in the
form of legacies to those whom he had robbed.  His son -- or
nephew, as some think -- Simone Donati, fearing to lose the
fortune, persuaded him to postpone the making of his will until
it was too late; indeed, according to one version of the story,
he had him smothered.  Concealing the body of the dead man, he
persuaded this Gianni Schicchi, who had most marvellous powers of
mimicry, to put himself in Buoso's bed, assume the voice and
features of the dying man, and dictate to a notary a will leaving
everything to Simone.  Gianni sustained his part to a miracle,
but took care to pay himself for his services as personator: in
one clause of the will which he dictated he left to himself what
Dante calls `the lady of the herd,' a beautiful mare valued at a
thousand gold florins.  This dangerous gift of mimicry seems to
have run in the blood.  According to Toynbee, Gianni `had a son
Guiduccio, who... was nicknames Scimmia ("ape"), a sobriquet
which appears to have been adopted by the family, as the figure
of an ape is sculptured on Giuduccio's tomb in Santa Croce.' 
Dante seems to distinguish in Myrrha and Gianni Schicchi two
species of personation: the former `falsified herself ^in the
form of another~'; the latter `falsified Buoso Donati ^in
himself.~'  The distinction is very obscure, but it may mean that
Myrrha personated by assuming a disguise, `the form of another,'
while Gianni personated `in himself,' in the play and alteration
of his own form and features.  Fortunately nothing of importance
in the interpretation depends on the distinction.

	|49-90.~  The third class in this `cloister' are
Falsifiers of Coin.  Its chief representative is Maestro Adamo of
Brescia, the title Master signifying his great skill in the art
of coining.  As the travellers pass, he begs them to look and
mark the greatness of his suffering.  His disease is dropsy,
which has so swelled his body, while it has left his face and
neck emaciated, that had his legs been cut off, says Dante, he
would have been exactly like a lute.  The Counts of Romena in the
valley of Casentino had employed this skilful `Master' of the art
to `seal with the Baptist's image' (the stamp on one side of the
gold florins of Florence) base coins which contained three carats
of alloy.  The fraud being discovered, the Florentines burned
Master Adam on the public road near Romena; a heap of stones
called `The Cairn of the Dead Man' is popularly believed to mark
the spot, and until recently passing travellers were in the habit
of casting a stone upon it.

	It is difficult to say what exact symbolism the disease
of dropsy represented to Dante's mind; but from the nature of the
sin, it appears probable that he regarded the derangement in the
distribution of the humours of the human body as an image of the
corresponding derangement which false coining produces in the
body politic.  He may have had in view a passage in the ^Ethics~
(v. 8) in which Aristotle traces the invention of money to the
necessity for a medium of exchange which shall have, as far as
possible, a constant value.  Money is the nearest approach to
this constant value yet discovered; and any debasing of the
currency, by disturbing this fixed standard, throws society into
confusion.  Just as in dropsy one part swells and another pines
away, so in the body politic one section of the community is
bloated with wealth, while another grows emaciated with poverty.

	The significance of the burning thirst from which the
forger sufferers is more obvious.  Like the rich man in the
parable, Master Adam longs for a drop of water.  It is doubtless
symbolic of that thirst for gold which drove him to the crime
that sank him to his Moat.  It corresponds to the itch of the
Alchemists and the insanity of the Personators: the earthly habit
has grown into an eternal torment.  But perhaps the most striking
thing is the way in which the stern justice of God turns the very
memory of the spot where the sin was sinned into a greater
torture than the thirst itself.  The passage must be quoted in
full:

     `I has while living enough of what I wished,
     And now, alas! one little drop of water crave.
     The rivulets that from the verdant hills
     Casentino descend down into Arno,
     Making their channels cool and moist,
     Ever before me stand, and not in vain:
     For far more doth their image dry me up
     Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
     The rigid justice which doth search me through
     Drawth occasion from the place I sinned,
     The more to set my sighs in flight.
     There is Romena, where I did falsify
     The alloy sealed with the Baptist's image,
     For which I left my body burned above.'

Like many another sinful man, this Master Adam evidently had some
genuine delight in the beauty of Nature.  There may have come to
him hours when the loveliness of the hills and rivulets of the
Casentino was felt as a rebuke to his base thirst for gold, and
for one brief better moment he may have hated the sin which was
so utterly out of harmony with the scene.  Even Falstaff at the
end `played with flowers' and `babbled o' green fields.'  Dante
wishes to warn us that if we defile some fair scene of earth with
an evil deed, the memory of its purity and peace may lurk in the
soul with a stranger persistence, and, under the revealing touch
of death, become a haunting inevitable pain.  There is, in truth,
something peculiarly heinous in sins committed in the midst of
the purity and loveliness of God's works -- something which His
justice may well make the minister of our punishment;

     `He who sinneth in the city
     May find margin to be witty;

     He who in the woods doth sin,
     Him the drear fiend enters in.'

	But this Adam of Brescia was consumed by another thirst
more burning than that for either gold or water.  To quench it,
he declares he would part with Fonte Branda: according to some,
the famous fountain of Siena, but much more probably one of the
same name at Romena, the scene of his crime.  This more burning
thirst was the desire for vengeance on his employers in the
forgery, the three brothers, Guido, Alessandro, and Aghinolfo,
Lords of Romena.  If the `raving shades,' such as Myrrha and
Gianni Schicchi, who wandered through all parts of the valley,
spoke truth, one of the brothers was here already; but Adam, not
satisfied with mere report, longed to see his sufferings with his
own eyes, and bemoaned his powerlessness to stir which kept him
from setting out on the quest:

     `But what avails it me whose limbs are tied?
     If I were only still so light, that in
     A hundred years I could advance one inch,
     I had already started on the way
     Seeking him out 'mong this deformed folk,
     Although it winds around eleven miles,
     And is not less than half a mile across.'

Thus powerless this wretched soul sat there consumed with thirst
within thirst -- for gold, for the cool waters of the Casentino,
for vengeance on those who had tempted him to his doom: all the
good and evil of his earthly life turned into an eternal torment
of vain remorse and baffled desire [a letter, attributed to
Dante, condoles with Counts Oberto and Guido of Romena on the
death of their uncle Alessandro, who is spoken of as now among
the blessed in Paradise.  A great controversy has raged over the
question whether this is the Alessandro here set in Hell.  See
Latham's ^Dante's Eleven Letters~, pp. 35-64.  From the eleven
miles here and the twenty-two in v. 9 of the preceding Canto,
much useless ingenuity has been spent in calculating the
dimensions of the Inferno as a whole.  Gabriel Rossetti thinks
Dante wishes to identify the city of Dis with the city of Rome:
`the outward trench of the walls of Rome (whether real or
imaginary we say not) was reckoned by Dante's contemporaries to
be exactly twenty-two miles; and the walls of the city were then
and still are, eleven miles round.'  See {comment to ^Inf.~
xviii. 1-9}].

	|91-99.~  At Dante's request, Master Adam names two souls
lying close upon his right, and smoking `like a wet hand in
winter.'  They belong to the fourth and last class, Liars,
Falsifiers of their Word, -- Potiphar's wife whose false
accusation brought Joseph to a dungeon, and Sinon the Greek whose
lying tongue persuaded the Trojans to admit the wooden horse by
which their city fell [^AEn.~ ii. 57 ff.].  Adam says he found
them lying here when he was `rained' into this chasm; they have
not moved since, and he thinks they will not move to all
eternity.  He was soon to learn to his cost that one of them was
active enough when he saw occasion for it.  Their punishment is a
burning fever which makes them steam with a foul smoke, and racks
their heads with pain.  It is not easy to say what is the
symbolic meaning of this disease.  Probably in the case of `the
false woman who accused Joseph,' it represents the fever of the
unholy passion which drove her to so cruel a slander of an
innocent man.  The pain in the head means that the brain which
conceived the lies is now being consumed by them; while the foul
smoke may indicate the foulness of the heart within, which thus
sends forth the cloud and exhalation of its falseness.

	|100-108.~  Just as they are about to leave this last
Moat, a peculiar incident occurs.  The Greek, overhearing the
conversation, and resenting the way in which he was `named so
darkly' as `the false Sinon,' suddenly flung out his arm and
struck Adam a severe blow on his swollen paunch, which made it
resound like a drum.  The coiner was not slow to return the blow
on the face; whereupon there began a shower of mutual taunts and
revilings to which Dante stood listening eagerly until roused by
Virgil's angry words:

                          `Now keep staring!
     For little lacks it that ^I~ quarrel with ^thee.~'
     {vv. 131-132}

	|133-148.~  Dante turned away in shame so great that it
still came over him when he thought of it.  Finding no words of
excuse, his very look pled for him; and Virgil, pitying his
confusion, told him that `less shame would wash away a greater
fault.'  At the same time, he warns him earnestly against
allowing himself to listen to such vile wrangles:

     `Make account that I am aye beside thee,
     If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
     Where there are people in a like dispute:
     For a base wish it is to wish to hear.'

Dante probably had two reasons for relating this incident: one,
to show the hatreds and discords which increase the miseries of
the lost; the other, to confess and rebuke a weakness which he
found in himself, a certain readiness to listen to quarrel.  It
is a strange weakness to find in so great a lover of peace, and
was perhaps due to his delight in the flash of wit and repartee. 
Whatever the cause, he recognizes it as a serious fault, for
which Virgil, his own reason, rebukes him.  `A person of tact,'
says Aristotle, `is one who will use and listen to such language
as is suitable to an honourable gentleman....  The language to
which a person listens will correspond to the language which he
uses' [^Ethics~, iv. 14].  It is for this reason that Plato would
banish from the stage of his ideal Republic all vulgar actions
and low dialogues -- women quarrelling with their husbands, or
rogues and cowards `jesting, scolding, reviling, in drink or out
of drink, or otherwise sinning against themselves or others in
word or deed, as the manner of such is.'  To hear and see such
things breeds a corresponding baseness and vulgarity in the
audience [^Republic~, iii. 395-398].
