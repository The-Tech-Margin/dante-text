	|1-36.~  We have now reached the last `cloister' of this
great Circle, and, as already pointed out, it is extremely
difficult to discover any principle of grandation on which its
ten forms of Fraud are arranged.  One would expect, for instance,
that Simony, which is a fraud against the Church, would be set
lower down than Barratry, which is fraud against the State; and
that the Hypocrisy which crucified Christ would be sunk far below
Alchemy, which `apes Nature'; but it is not so.  Since Fraud is a
social sin, it is possible that the classification represents
Dante's view of the degrees in which the various forms of this
evil undermine and ruin society.  As we look back on the awful
place, its chief characteristic is undoubtedly its foulness. 
Dante seems to have strained even his terrible imagination to
crowd into its dark pits as much of loathsome and diabolic as
they could hold: demons, filth, pitch, serpents, wounds,
mutilations, deformities, insanity, leprosy, dropsy, fever --
everything that can distort, defile, and eat away the form and
features of humanity.  The whole place is filled with the
sickening stench of the unspeakable corruption.  It is not, as
Landor and others appear to think, because Dante's imagination
delighted in vile images -- only those can believe this who never
read beyond the ^Inferno~; it is simply because he wished to
stamp Fraud in all its varieties with the foulness and deformity
which he believed to be its native and essential characteristics. 
It is its secrecy and duplicity which compel him to take this
serious view of it.  An open sin even of the same kind, just
because open, was in his judgement clean and wholesome by
comparison; at least, it did not rot and mutilate human nature. 
But `Fraud is man's peculiar vice,' because its instrument is
man's peculiar gift of Reason; it `cuts the bond of love which
Nature makes,' the general knot and fellowship of mankind, and
thus secretly undermines the trust of man in man which makes any
true brotherhood of humanity possible.  To Dante's mind no
foulness of imagery was too horrible or loathsome to picture
forth such a sin; its only adequate presentment was the
Guardian-spirit of this lower Hell: a foul blend of the human,
the brute, and the diabolic -- the face of a just man, the paws
of a beast, and the tail of a serpent tipped with a scorpion's
sting.

	One last incident seems intended to show Dante's attitude
to the vendetta, -- that wild family blood-feud so relentlessly
bequeathed from generation to generation.  The sight of these
cloven souls so filled his eyes with tears that he longed to
remain and weep, but Virgil rebukes his delay.  Why linger over
this Bolgia when he had not done so over the others?  The valley
had a circuit of two-and-twenty miles, and obviously he could not
hope to number all the shades in that vast round.  The moon, too,
was underneath their feet, that is, it was one or two in the
afternoon, and only a short time remained to see the rest.  Dante
replied that his reason for lingering was that he was looking for
`a spirit of his own blood,' whom he believed to be in this Moat. 
This was Geri (^i.e.~ Ruggieri) del Bello of the Alighieri
family, a first cousin, it is said, of Dante's father.  He was a
great stirrer up of strife, and was finally murdered by one of
the Sacchetti with whom he was at feud.  Virgil then told Dante
that while he was absorbed in gazing at Bertran de Born, he had
seen him at the foot of the bridge, pointing at him with
threatening finger, and had heard the others name him Geri del
Bello.  Dante replies that he knows the cause of his anger: his
death had never been avenged by any of his kindred, or, as he
puts it, `any who is a partner of the shame,' --

              `therefore he went away
     Without speaking to me, as I imagine;
     And in that has made me pity him the more.'

The meaning of this pity has been much disputed.  At first glance
it seems to imply sympathy with the vendetta, which was
sanctioned by the law of Florence in Dante's day, and many
commentators take this view; nevertheless it seems utterly
inconsistent with the whole drift of the passage, which means
nothing if it is not a condemnation of such feuds.  Mosca de'
Lamberti has his hands cut off for originating one such family
feud, which embroiled the whole city.  Farther up in Hell, Guy de
Montfort is plunged up to the throat in the River of Blood for
avenging his father's death by murder.  Dante could not therefore
with any consistency have avowed sympathy with the vendetta.  His
pity for his kinsman is not that his death has remained
unavenged; but rather that the passion for revenge burns on
unquenched by death and adds a new torture to his agony.  In
Rossetti's ^Dante and his Circle~ (241-248), a translation is
given of a sonnet by Forese Donati in which he `taunts Dante
ironically for not avenging Geri Alighieri,' and more generally
for his tame acceptance of blows and forgiveness of injuries:

     `Thou hast taught us a fair fashion, sooth to say, --
     That whoso lays a stick well to thy back,
     Thy comrade and thy brother he shall be.'

It is very difficult to recognize Dante in this garb of meekness;
but at least it shows that he had the reputation of being no
friend of the vendetta [thirty years after his death, Geri was
avenged by his nephews, who murdered one of the Sacchetti.  In
1342 the two families were formally reconciled.  Speaking of Rome
in the fifteenth century, Gregorovius says: `Criminal justice had
a difficult task, for the people had become utterly depraved by
"vendette" and hereditary feuds.  The defiant power of
individuals mocked at law, and every one fought for himself as he
pleased....  The men who fought in vendetta were called
"brigosi."  In certain circumstances they had the right of
barring their houses, and filling them with armed men.  Vendetta
was the most dreadful scourge of all cities in Italy, and in Rome
it claimed countless victims.  Not only relations but also
strangers offered themselves for hire to him who had insult to
avenge'].

	|37-51.~  The pilgrims now arrive at the tenth Moat --
`the last cloister of Malebolge,' in which, as Carlyle says, the
sinners are the `lay-brothers' and the demons the monks.  At
first the darkness was so thick that they could see nothing from
the crag on which they stood; but when they reached the summit of
the bridge, out of the gloom rose a foul smell of putrid limbs
and cries of pain, as if all the hospitals in the most
fever-haunted regions of Italy and Sardinia had emptied their
sick into this black ditch.  So heartrending were the groans and
lamentations of the vast lazar-house, that Dante put his hands to
his ears to shut them out.  Descending to the last and lowest of
the ramparts of Malebolge, he was able through the darkened air
to discern some of the sufferers.  One was lying on his face, a
second across the shoulders of another, while some crawled about
from place to place to find a spot to ease their pain.  They are
the souls of Falsifiers, divided, as we shall see, into four
classes: Falsifiers of Metals, of Persons, of Coins, and of their
Word.  These four species of Falsifiers are afflicted with
different diseases, according to their particular form of the
sin; the general conception of the punishment seeming to be that
men who spent their lives falsifying things on earth, are now
themselves falsified, so to speak, by horrible diseases which
change and disfigure their true forms and features.  The idea may
have been suggested by Aquinas.  Discussing the sin of lying,
whether in word, or sign, or deed, St. Thomas says `a lie is an
act falling on undue matter: for words being naturally signs of
thoughts, it is a thing unnatural and undue for any one to
signify in word what he has not in his mind' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
cx. a. 3.].  The ^unnaturalness~ of this sin is the leading idea
in the mind of Acquinas; and Dante simply throws this
unnaturalness into the visible form of disease, which is an
unnatural state of the human body.

	|73-75.~  Passing along the rampart in silence as through
the wards of a hospital, and listening to the cries of the sick,
the travellers came on two souls, leaning against each other like
two platters set before the fire to warm.  The comparison has
probably a double appropriateness: it refers first to the
utensils and fires they once used in their old occupation of
Alchemy, and, in the next place, to the fact that they were both
burned to death for the practice of this black art. 

	|76-84.~  The punishment of these Alchemist is twofold --
paralysis and leprosy.  So weak are they that they have to prop
each other up like two pans before the fire; and when Virgil
tells them that Dante is alive, they start asunder, each
trembling like a man paralyzed.  Some commentators trace this
paralytic condition to the excessive use of mercury by
alchemists, and give as their authority Avicenna, the Arabian
philosopher and physician.  The other disease of leprosy is
described with realism which almost nauseates.  From head to foot
the two wretches are covered with scabs, the itch of which is so
intolerable a torture that they never cease tearing away the
leprous scurf with their nails:

     And never saw I plied a currycomb
     By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
     Nor him who keeps unwillingly awake,
     As each was plying fast the bite
     Of nails upon himself, for the great fury
     Of the itch, which has no other succour.
     And so the nails downward drew the scab
     In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
     Or other fish that has them larger still.

The symbolic meaning of all this is not easy to conjecture.  `It
is worthy of remark,' says one commentator, `that Aristotle
describes lead as a leprous gold; and these people who wanted to
convert lead into gold, are now one mass of putrefying leprosy.' 
This, however, only explains the punishment from the outside; the
interior moral significance must flow from the nature of the sin
itself.  In the first place, as these Alchemists were `apes of
Nature,' so this disease apes Nature in their own persons. 
Leprosy changes a man into a hideous ape and caricature of
humanity: those who falsify Nature are themselves falsified.  Nor
is this a mere fanciful idea.  Nothing so surely preserves the
true form and features of our humanity as reverence for Nature
and loyal submission to the laws and ordinances which God has
revealed in her; any attempt to run counter to her order, and to
transmute her into something else than God made her to be, issues
in the end in some deformity and disease of the soul, which eats
it away like leprosy.  In the next place, the itch represents the
torment of restlessness which alchemical pursuits seem to create,
and the paralysis the way in which they deaden a man's faculties
in every natural and healthy direction.  Perhaps the best
commentary on this punishment is Balzac's novel, ^La Recherche de
l'Absolu~, in which he gives a most vivid and terrible picture of
the way in which Alchemy, like a leprous itch, eats away a man's
fortune, family affections, mind, heart, soul, and leaves him
utterly paralyzed for any natural pursuit or interest.  Dante
means to tell us that this unhealthy itch which gave them no rest
on earth, loses none of its torturing power in eternity: there as
here it eats away the soul like an incurable and loathsome
disease, and leaves it for ever paralyzed for things healthy,
natural, and right.

	|88-92.~  Virgil asks them if there are any Latians among
them, and they reply that they are Latians both. 

	|109-120.~  At Dante's request one of them relates how he
came into this Moat.  His name was Griffolino of Arezzo, who was
burned at Siena on a charge of heresy, or, according to others,
of necromancy.  Neither one nor other, however, was his real sin,
else he would have been in one of the Moats or Circles above. 
His tragic death came about through a mere joke.  He had boasted
in jest to Albert, the reputed son of the Bishop of Siena, that
he could fly through the air like Daedalus; and because he did
not teach him the art, Albert denounced him to his father the
Bishop, who had him burned for necromancy or heresy.  But the
Judge of Hell, `Minos, who cannot err,' corrected the Bishop's
judgment, consigning him to this Moat for his real sin of
Alchemy.

	|121-123.~  When Dante heard Siena mentioned, he turned
to Virgil, exclaiming,

                       `Now was ever
     So vain a people as the Sienese?
     Not for a certainty the French by far.'

By vanity Dante seems to mean a kind of empty-headed frivolity. 
It is said that to this day the Florentines call a nail without a
head `a Sienese nail.' 

	|124-132.  On hearing this judgment of Sienese vanity,
the second of the two Alchemists broke in sarcastically:

                       `Always excepting Stricca,
     Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
     And Niccol@o, who the luxurious use
     Of the clove did first discover
     In the garden where such seed takes root;
     And leaving out the band, amoung whom squandered
     Caccia d'Ascian his vineyard and great forest,
     And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered.'

The reference is to four members of the ^Brigata Spendereccia~ or
`Spendthrift Club' of Siena: a fifth, Lano, we have seen pursued
in the Wood of the Suicides by the black dogs of his own
extravagance.  The Club consisted of twelve rich young men who
hired a great palace in Siena in which each had his rooms, gave
magnificent banquets, and lived on such a scale of insane
extravagance that in a few months they reduced themselves to
poverty and became a laughing-stock to the whole country. 
`Abbagliato' means `dazed,' and is probably a nickname like our
`muddle-head.'  He is thought by some to be Folgore da San
Gemignano, the poet of the Club, to which he is believed to have
addressed a set of Sonnets in which he sings the pleasures of
each month of the changing year.  This would account for the
reference to his wit: the other members gave their wealth; he
being a poor man could contribute nothing but his wit, his poetic
gift, of which obviously Dante had a poorer opinion than the
young rakes for whom he sang [for some account of Folgore, see J.
A. Symonds's ^Renaissance in Italy: ^Italian Literature~, i.
46-50; 462-466.  This `Abbagliato' is, however, usually
identified with another member of the Club, Bartolommeo de'
Folcacchieri, `a man of small means but of good abilities, which,
however, he entirely sacrificed from keeping company with so
dissipated a set of spendthrifts'].

	|133-139.~  The second of the Alchemists, who thus
sarcastically defends the prodigals from the charge of vanity, is
one Capocchio, probably a Florintine, who was also burned for
Alchemy at Siena.  He reminds Dante that he had known him on
earth as a cunning alchemist -- `a good ape of Nature':

     `But that thou know who thus doth second thee
     Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
     Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
     So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's shade,
     Who the metals falsified by alchemy;
     And thou must remember, if I eye thee well,
     How I was of Nature a good ape.'

The usual interpretation of the phrase `a good ape of Nature' is
that Capocchio had, according to the old commentators, great
powers of mimicry; but I prefer to regard it as descriptive of
his skill as an alchemist.  It is said that Dante was his
fellow-student in Natural Philosophy; and there may even be a
hint that there was a time in his life when he too had felt the
temptation of alchemical experiments.  If so, the time was past;
he now saw in the effort to transmute one metal into another an
impious attempt to `ape Nature,' and thus falsify God's own
handiwork.
