	|19-30.~  Turning to the left along the bank of the
canal, Dante saw some of the souls rise like dolphins out of the
pitch to lighten their pain if only for a moment.  Others lay on
the brink with their muzzles out, like frogs, ready to plunge if
they heard a sound of the demons who patrolled the banks. 

	|31-75.~  He still shudders, he tells us, to remember how
one wretch who was a moment too late in plunging was caught by
one of the demons by the hair, dragged ashore like an otter, and
cruelly tortured [^Inf.~ xxii. 31-96].  At Dante's entreaty
Virgil interferes, asking him who he is, and who are his
companions in the pitch; but every now and then his story is
interrupted by the impatience of the fiends to have their will of
him.  One gored him with his tusk; a second with his hook tore
away a tendon from his arm; a third aimed a savage blow at his
legs; and it was only by clasping him in his arms, and even then
with difficulty, that the decurion, Barbariccia, protected him
till his story was finished.  His name, which he himself does not
mention, is given by the early commentators as Ciampolo.  He
tells Virgil that he was a native of Navarre; that his father was
a spendthrift knave who destroyed both himself and his goods; and
that his mother in consequence had placed him in the service of a
lord.  From this he became a retainer of `good King Thibault,'
that is, Teobaldo II. of Navarre, a man of great justice and
clemency.  It is said that he gained the entire confidence of the
King, who left the disposal of offices and favours in his hands. 

	|76-87.~  At Virgil's request, he tells that his
companion in the pitch who escaped when he was caught, was Fra
Gomita, `vessel of every fraud', `not a petty, but a sovereign
barrator.'  This Friar (of what Order is unknown) was appointed
as his deputy or chancellor during his absence by Nino de'
Visconti, Judge of the Judicature of Gallura in Sardinia [Dante
meets Nino among the negligent rulers in the Valley of the
Princes on Mount Purgatory (^Purg.~ viii. 46-84).  He was chief
of the Guelph party in Pisa, and was treacherously driven out of
the city by his grandfather, Count Ugolino della Gherardesca
(^Inf.~ xxxii. 124-xxxiii. 78)].  The `noble Judge,' as Dante
calls him, would never believe the reports of his unfaithfulness;
but when at last he discovered that he had accepted bribes and
allowed certain of his enemies to escape from prison, Nino
straightway had him hanged.

	|88-96.~  Underneath the pitch the Friar has for crony
Don Michel Zanche, Governor of Logodoro in Sardinia, and the two
worthies are never tried, says Ciampolo, of gossiping of their
native island.  This Don Michel was vicar of Enzio, natural son
of Frederick II.  Enzio became King of Sardinia by his marriage
with Adelasia, heiress of Logodoro and Gallura.  Shortly after,
this ill-fated prince was captured by the Bolognese, and died
after more than twenty years' imprisonment.  His wife obtained a
divorce, and married his vicar in Logodoro, this Michel Zanche,
who about the year 1290 was treacherously murdered by his
son-in-law, Branca d'Oria of Genoa.  Dante tells us that while
the body of this traitor continued to `eat, and drink, and sleep,
and put on clothes,' his soul was frozen into the ice of Cocytus
in the lowest Hell before the spirit of his murdered
father-in-law had time to reach this moat of boiling pitch
[^Inf.~ xxxiii. 136-147].

	|97-151.~  Ciampolo's old earthly cunning now stands him
in good stead, and proves itself a match even for the demons.  He
proposes that if they withdraw themselves a little out of sight
he will give to his comrades in the river a signal by whistling
that the coast is clear, and thus for one they will have seven to
torture.  At first, Cagnazzo and the rest oppose it as a
transparent trick, but are finally persuaded by Alichino, who
threatens Ciampolo that if he dares to dive into the pitch he
will swoop down upon him with his wings.

     The Navarrese well his time selected;
     Planted the soles on land, and in an instant
     Leaped, and from their purpose freed himself.
     [^Inf.~ xxii. 121-123.]

Alichino's pursuit was in vain -- `wings could not outstrip the
terror.'  As he returned angry and weary, like a falcon that has
missed its prey, Calcabrina, only too glad of an excuse for a
quarrel, grappled with him, and the two fiends fell fighting into
the boiling pitch, which so `belimed' their wings that their
companions had to drag them out with their hooks.
