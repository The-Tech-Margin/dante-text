	|1-6.~  But the heaviest condemnation falls on his own
city.  Ironically he congratulates it on being as famous in Hell
as throughout the earth:

     Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great
     That over land and sea thou beatest thy wings,
     And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
     Among the thieves I found five such
     Thy citizens, whence shame comes unto me,
     And thou thereby to no great honour risest.

It may be said, of course, that this is only a savage vindictive
blow aimed by Dante at the city which banished him on a charge of
barratry; but making allowance for some not unnatural personal
feeling, there is obviously something far nobler.  His irony has
a central core of sorrow -- sorrow such as wrung tears from the
prophets of Israel, foreseeing in the general corruption of the
nation their country's doom.  He seems to have had specially
before his mind one line of Isaiah in his lament over the fall of
`the faithful city': `Thy princes are rebellious, and companions
of thieves.'  For this is the point of the words, `Among the
thieves I found five such thy citizens.'  `Five ^such~': not one
of them from the scum of the people, but every man sprung from
the noblest families in Florence. 

	|7-9.~  What hope was there for a city whose very princes
were thieves and companions of thieves?  He had had sad dreams of
it -- morning dreams which come true:

     But if near the morning truth is dreamed of,
     Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
     What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.

Prato can scarcely be the city of that name, since it was in
general friendly to Florence.  The reference is much more likely
to be to Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato, who was sent by Benedict XI.
in the spring of 1304 to make peace between the Florentine
Guelphs and Ghibellines.  Failing in his mission, he departed on
the 4th of June, leaving the city under an interdict and its
inhabitants excommunicated.  Within a week, on the 10th, a great
fire, originated by a dissolute priest, burnt down more than
seventeen hundred houses, towers, and palaces -- `in short,' says
Villani, `all the marrow and yolk and the most precious places of
the city.  The loss of stores, and of treasure, and of
merchandise was infinite, forasmuch as in those places were
almost all the merchandise and precious things of Florence, and
that which was not burnt was robbed by highwaymen as it was
being carried away, the city being continually at war in divers
places, wherefore many companies, and clans, and families were
ruined and brought to poverty by the said fires and robberies.' 
Villani says it was commonly held that this and other adversities
and perils which befell Florence about this time were due to the
interdict laid on the city by the Cardinal da Prato [^Villani~,
viii. 71]. 

	|10-12.~  As he thinks of all this, Dante could almost
wish that the doom had already fallen, since fall it must,
knowing that with advancing years he will find harder to bear the
ruin of the city which he loved perhaps the more because of his
unjust exile from her:

     And if it already were, 'twere not too soon;
     Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
     For it will weigh me down the more I age.

	|13-18.~  The eighth Moat, to which we now come, is that
of Evil Counsellors.  From the broken ledge to which they had
descended to see into the dark valley of the Thieves, the two
pilgrims climb back to the cliff which forms the next bridge.  It
is not easy walking: Virgil has to draw Dante up, and 'the foot
without  the hand sped not.' 

	|19-24.~  As he looked at these flamelets, Dante tells us
there fell on him a certain sadness, and a solemn sense of
responsibility for the use of his genius.  These were souls who
had perished through the perversion of the great intellectual
powers God had given them; and he trembled as he felt within
himself the same danger of intellectual perdition.  To him even
as to them, he knew that God had given great powers of mind, and
it is far from improbable that he had frequently known the
temptation to which they had yielded.  In the troubled politics
of his time there must have come many opportunities of using his
great intellect of crafty purposes, to bend his fellowmen to his
own ends or those of his party.  Perhaps Dante was too imperious
a soul to be in any real danger of stooping to win men by craft
and policy -- as witness his breaking away from the Ghibellines
and forming a party by himself [^Par.~ xvii. 61-66];
nevertheless, in the presence of these lost minds to which he
felt himself akin, he is so impressed with the possibility of a
similar perdition that he reins in those high intellectual powers
which some `good star or better thing,' such as the grace of God,
perchance had given him:

     Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
     When I direct my mind to what I saw;
     And more my genius curb than I am wont,
     That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
     So that if a good star or better thing
     Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.

	|25-33.~  When they reach the highest point of the
bridge, Dante looks down and compares the sight to the swarm of
fireflies which the Italian peasant sees in the darkening valley
below, as he rests on a summer evening on the hillside after his
day's work is done.  In the same way this infernal valley
twinkled with innumerable little flames, and every flame
concealed a human soul; or, as Dante expresses it,

                Not one reveals the theft,
     And every flame a sinner steals away {vv. 41-42}.

	|34-39.~  Just as to Elisha watching the translation of
his master, there came a moment when the forms of Elijah and
horses and chariots vanished, leaving nothing visible save `the
flame alone, even as a little cloud ascending up,' so here the
soul was completely hidden by the fire.  Although Dante puts this
in the form of a simile, there can be little doubt that this
particular comparison is chosen for the sake of the contrast it
involves.  By his faithful and fearless warnings to King Ahab,
Elijah is the type of a good counsellor, and his reward is a
fiery triumph heavenward.  The souls in this Moat are Evil
Counsellors, and their doom is an eternal imprisonment within a
narrow tongue of fire in the heart of Hell.

	|43-45.~  It is certainly to this temptation he refers
when he tells us that he almost fell into the valley.  After
climbing on hands and feet to the arch of the bridge, he stood
erect to look down, and had he not caught one of the rocks, he
says he would have gone over without a push.  It sounds like the
recollection of some critical moment when he almot fell into that
crafty use of his intellectual powers which would have carried
him down to `this blind world' [^Inf.~ xxvi. 16-24; 43-45].

	|52-54.~  Dante compares the two horns into which their
flame parted to those which rose from the funeral pyre of
Eteocles and Polynices.  These two brothers quarrelled over the
succession to the throne of their father, OEdipus of Thebes, and
slew each other in the war of the Seven against Thebes which
followed.  Even death could not quench their hatred: the very
flames which consumed their bodies divided and refused to mingle
[Statius, ^Thebaid~, xii. 431].  By comparing the cloven flame of
Ulysses and Diomed to their funeral pyre, Dante means that they
were torn by a similar hatred; men who helped to ruin each other
here are not likely to waste much love on one another there. 

	|55.~  Two examples of Evil Counsellors are given,
chosen, as is Dante's custom, from heathen and Christian times. 
The heathen instance is Ulysses and Diomed, who are imprisoned
together in one flame which parts at the top into a double
tongue, the greater of which is Ulysses.  These two in their
earthly life had been accomplices in many a fraud, three of which
are specially named, probably because of their connection with
the founding of Rome: `the ambush of the horse' by which Troy was
taken and `the noble seed of the Romans' driven forth; the craft
by which they drew Achilles to the war, leaving Deidameia to die
of grief; and the theft of the Palladium, the famous statue of
Pallas Athene, on which the safety of Troy hung [^AEn.~ ii.
162-170].  Ulysses was more the mind that planned, Diomed more the
hand that executed; they are, therefore, imprisoned in the same
flame, and this is an increase of their torment. 

	|70-75.~  Dante is most anxious to speak with `the horned
flame,' and Virgil praises him for the wish; but at the same time
warns him to refrain from addressing them, lest they should
disdain to answer because they were Greeks.  Many reasons have
been suggested for this, such as their old Greek scorn of
`barbarians'; or that speech with men of the ancient world is
more appropriately left to Virgil, while Dante converses with
moderns.  The likelier reason here is that Dante is a descendant
of their ancient Trojan enemies, and Virgil might be regarded as
sprung from another stock, since his native city was founded by
Manto, the Theban prophetess.  At all events, Virgil ventures to
address them, adjuring them by the fame he had given them in his
`lofty verses,' to say where Ulysses in his wide wanderings had
gone away to die.

	|90-142.~  The question is very characteristic of Dante. 
His imagination seems to have taken a weird delight in
constructing an ideal ending of life for men and women whose
death was surrounded with mystery: Count Ugolino in the Tower of
Famine, and Buonconte da Montefeltro's lonely death in the valley
of the Arno, will readily occur to the reader.  Where and how the
Great Wanderer met his end had been left untold by the Homeric
legends. The only hint given in the ^Odyssey~ is the prophecy of
Tiresias when Ulysses meets him among the souls of dead heroes in
the under-world: `And from the sea shall thine own death come,
the gentlest death that may be, which shall end thee foredone
with smooth old age.'  Although Dante had no direct acquaintance
with Homer, some hint of this death of Ulysses from the sea may
have reached him through translations of Greek works; and it has
been suggested that his imagination wrought the story of the wild
adventure `out of the Genoese voyages of discovery in search of a
Western continent, which resulted ultimately in the discovery of
America, but which up to this time had proved fruitless.  One
such expedition left in 1291, and was never heard of again.  With
this general idea Dante may have combined the well-known fable,
repeated by the crusaders and others, of the Mountain of
Loadstone by which ships were attracted and dashed to pieces'
[Moore, ^Studies in Dante~ (1st series), 264 n.].  The story as
told by `the greater horn of the ancient flame' is of so vivid an
interest that it must be given in full.  There can be no doubt
that Tennyson's Ulysses is a paraphrase -- splendid, no doubt,
but still a paraphrase -- of this passage.  There is the same
impatience of dull domestic tameness; the same determination to
`drink life to the lees'; the same scorn of hoarding the remnant
of the years; and the same high resolve

           `to follow knowledge like a sinking star
     Beyond the utmost bounds of human thought.'

The translation given is Longfellow's:

                                      `When I
     From Circe had departed, who concealed me
     More than a year there near unto Ga,eta,
     Or ever yet AEneas named it so,{1}
     Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
     For my old father, nor the due affection
     Which joyous should have made Penelope,
     Could overcome within me the desire
     I had to be experienced of the world,
     And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
     But I put forth on the high open sea
     With one sole ship, and that small company
     By which I never had deserted been.
     Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
     Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
     And the others which that sea bathes round about.
     I and my company were old and slow
     When at that narrow passage we arrived
     Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
     That man no farther onward should adventure.
     On the right behind me I left Seville,
     And on the other already had left Ceuta.
     "O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
     Perils," I said, "have come unto the West,
     To this so inconsiderable a vigil
     Which is remaining of your senses still,
     Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
     Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
     Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
     Ye were not made to live unto brutes,
     But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge."
     So eager did I render my companions,
     With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
     That then I hardly could have held them back.
     And having turned our stern unto the morning,
     We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
     Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
     Already all the stars of the other pole
     The night beheld, and ours so very low
     It did not rise above the ocean floor.
     Five times rekindled and as many quenched
     Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
     Since we had entered into the deep pass,
     When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
     From distance, and it seemed to me so high
     As I had never any one beheld.
     Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
     For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
     And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
     Three times it made it whirl with all the waters,
     At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
     And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
     Until the sea above us closed again.'{2}

     [{1} A town in the north of Campania, named by AEneas
     after his nurse Ca,ieta (^AEn.~ vii. 1-4).]

     [{2} Contrast Plato's account of Ulysses in the vision of
     Er, ^Rep.~ x. 614-621.  After one thousand years in Hades 
     the souls are brought into a meadow to choose their lots 
     before their rebirth into another life on earth.  `There 
     came also the soul of Odysseus, having yet to make a 
     choice, and his lot happened to be the last of them all.  
     Now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him 
     of ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in 
     search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he 
     had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying
     about and had been neglected by everybody else; and when 
     he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had 
     he been first instead of last, and that he was delighted 
     at his choice.']

`Another' {v. 141} is God, but the holy name is never mentioned
in Hell save by Vanni Fucci in blasphemy.  If, as is probable,
the great mountain which they sight after their five months'
voyage is Mount Purgatory, which, according to Dante, rises at
the exact antipodes of Jerusalem, the storm which `rose from the
new land' has a symbolic meaning.  Being heathens, it was
impossible that they should land on Mount Purgatory, since only
those who are on the way to Paradise can gain a footing on its
shores.

	It is an interesting question whether this passage is
anything more than a magnificent excrescence on the general
subject.  `The story of Ulysses' last voyage and death,' writes a
recent commentator, `is a digression, like that of the foundation
of Mantua in ^Inf. XX~, for it bears no relation to the subject
of the ^Inferno.~  Both of these serve, however, to give variety,
and to lighten the uniformity of gloom' [Rev. H. F. Tozer's
^English Commentary~, p. 142].  It is difficult to believe that
Dante thus indulges himself in a mere poetic device to relieve
the strain; or that he is carried away by his imaginative delight
in `one crowded hour of glorious life.'  Is it not probable that
this wild adventure is narrated as the last piece of evil counsel
of which Ulysses was gulty?  The Pillars of Hercules on each side
of the Strait of Gibraltar were set as a sign and landmark of the
limits of the habitable world, beyond which it may have been
regarded as an impiety to sail.  By his evil counsel Ulysses so
inflamed his companions that he could scarcely have restrained
them had he wished.  Dante pictures him here as a soul insatiable
in its hunger for new experiences of human vice and virtue, but
insatiable only that he may the more craftily play upon the
weaknesses of mankind.

	The point of special moral interest, however, is the
contrast drawn between Ulysses as he was and as he is: on earth,
scorning the Pillars of his ancient world, and boldly launching
forth into `wild sea-liberties'; in this Moat, imprisoned to all
eternity within this narrow fire-fly flame.  It cannot be an
accident that Dante represents the great world-wandering soul as
thus `cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd.'  The meaning must lie
somewhere in the nature of the sin.  We think of a soul like
Ulysses as great and boundless in its insatiable craving for new
experiences, its wide and varied knowledge of the world, and its
skill in playing on the vices and virtues of mankind.  Dante will
have us understand that it is far otherwise.  Ulysses could say,
in Tennyson's words,

     `Much have I seen and known; cities of men
     And manners, climates, councils, governments,
     Myself not least, but honoured of them all';

nevertheless the craftiness in which he lived closed in like fate
around his soul; until at last all his vast knowledge of men is
narrowed down to `this blind world,' this flame no bigger than a
firefly, and this tormenting companionship with his accomplice in
cunning.  Thus it is that `He taketh the wise in their own
craftiness.'
