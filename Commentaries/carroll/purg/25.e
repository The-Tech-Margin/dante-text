	|1-9.~  The three poets now enter the stairway that leads to the 
last of the Terraces.  In his usual astronomic fashion Dante 
indicates that it is now about two o'clock in the afternoon, and 
therefore too late for loitering.  They push on in haste, the 
narrowness of the pathway compelling them to go in single file, 
perhaps to indicate that repentance is a solitary road which each 
man must tread alone. 

	|20-21.~  It is Dante's custom, however, to employ 
the time on the stairways in discussing with his Guide some 
question connected with the Terrace he has left or the one to 
which he goes; and at the present moment he is burning to ask one 
question suggested by the emaciated shades whom he has just seen: 
 
                      `How can one grow lean 
     There where the need of nourishment toucheth not?' 
 
The living skeletons whom he had left behind were bodiless souls, and 
could therefore have no need of food.  How, then, was it possible for 
them to experience sensations of hunger and thirst, and pine away for 
want of what they did not need, and could not use? [^Purg.~ xxv. 20, 
21]. 
 
	|22-24.~  The answer is one of the most difficult things to
understand in the whole poem, and it is doubtful whether, with all its
scholastic subtlety, it really sheds much light on the problem.  Virgil,
in his character of the natural Reason, can offer nothing but analogies. 
The first is the mysterious way in which Meleager `was consumed by the
consuming of a fire-brand.'  Seven days after his birth, the Fates
foretold that his life would last so long as a brand then burning in the
fire remained unconsumed; whereupon his mother Althaea extinguished it
and locked it in a chest.  Meleager when he grew to manhood enraged her
by slaying her brothers; and in revenge she burned the brand, and her
son died.  The idea seems to be akin to the superstition that an enemy
can be killed by the wasting away of his waxen effigy before the fire
(comp. ^Inf.~ xx. 121-123).  Dante appears to have believed that there
exist mysterious occult forces in Nature by which even inanimate things
have power to waste away the human frame; and if so, there is no
difficulty in believing that the Trees had the same mysterious
influence. 
 
	|25-27.~  The second analogy is the image reflected in a mirror: 
 
            `Think how at your gliding 
     Glideth within the mirror your own image.' 
 
This seems to touch the profounder truth that the `spiritual 
body' is a mirror which reflects exactly the moral state of the 
soul.  The soul of a glutton grows emaciated through the 
pampering of the flesh; and at death this spiritual emaciation is 
reflected, line for line, in the body which it creates for 
itself. 
 
	|28-29.~  Virgil, however, is aware that these are only figures and
analogies, and therefore refers the whole matter to Statius for its
final solution.  Statius must here represent the natural Reason 
enlightened by Christian philosophy.  In point of fact, a great part of
his answer is, as Dr. Moore says, `a ^r@echauff@e~ of Aristotle, ^De 
Gen. Anim.~, until a point is reached where Dante has to part company 
with Aristotle's guidance, and to follow Aquinas and other Christian 
teachers in expounding a Creationist theory of the origin of the 
soul.'  Statius therefore represents the point of transition from the 
philosophy of the natural Reason to that of Revelation (^Studies in 
Dante~, 1st Series, p. 32). 
 
	|34-78.~  The explanation begins with the Aristotelian doctrine of
generation.  Since man sums up in himself all the worlds of life 
beneath him in a higher unity, the embryo in its growth passes 
through three soul-forms.  First comes the ^vegetable~ soul, 
which differs from a plant in this, that it possesses the power 
of further development.  This further development carries it on 
to the ^animal~ soul, first in its simplest form, so `that now 
it moves and feels like a sea-fungus,' and then in the formation 
of the organs necessary for the various animal powers.  The next 
stage is the ^rational~ soul; and Statius warns Dante that this 
is the point at which he must be careful not to go astray.  The 
passage is so important that it will be well to have it before 
us: 
 
       `How from an animal it becometh human 
     Thou seest not yet; this is such a point 
     That one more wise than thou it once made err, 
     So that by his teaching he made separate 
     From the soul the possible intellect, 
     Because by it he saw no organ taken up. 
     Open thy breast unto the coming truth, 
     And know that so soon as in the embryo 
     The articulation of the brain is perfect, 
     The First Mover turns himself to it, with joy 
     Over so great an art of nature, and doth breathe 
     A spirit new with power all replete, 
     Which whatso it finds active there draws 
     Into its own substance, and makes itself one soul, 
     That lives, and feels, and itself within itself turns back.'
 
(^Purg.~ xxv. 61-75; compare Aquinas, ^Contra Gent.~ Book II. 
chaps. lxxxviii-lxxxix.: `The vegetative soul, therefore, which is 
first in the embryo, while it lives the life of a plant, is destroyed, 
and there succeeds a more perfect soul, which is at once nutrient and 
sentient, and for that time the embryo lives the life of an animal: 
upon the destruction of this, there succeeds the rational soul, infused
from without' -- ^i.e.~ by God direct [Father Rickaby's ^Of God and His
Creatures~, p. 168]).  The wiser man than Dante who fell into error on
this subject is generally believed to be Averro,es, though some think
Aristotle is meant.  `On many grounds,' as Dr. Moore says, `the former
seems more probable... partly because even if Dante were conscious that
Aristotle himself fell into this error, he would be more likely to keep
this in the background, especially when he had a scapegoat ready to hand
in the person of Averro,es.'  Still more decisive for this view is the
fact that Aquinas, whom Dante here follows closely, had written a
special treatise in refutation of the teaching of the great Arabian
sceptic on this very subject.  The difficulty gathers round the words
`possible intellect.'  Following Aristotle (^De An.~ III. iv. 3),
scholastic philosophy drew a distinction between the `possible
intellect' and the `active intellect.'  The former is viewed as a mere
potentiality -- an original and innate capability of universal ideas. 
But this `potential intellect' is made actual only by the operation on
it of the `active intellect.'  This `active intellect' is regarded by
Averro,es as the one transcendent, universal, and eternal intellect,
bearing the same relation to the `possible intellect' as the sun does
to the eye; and his error, to which Dante here refers, is that of
limiting the individual existence of the human intellect to this present
life, and recognizing the eternity only of the one universal `active
intellect.'  He was led to this view because he saw no special organ set
apart for the intellect, as the eye is for vision.  Obviously, such a
doctrine left no room for personal immortality.  The individual
intellect was only a passing form which the universal acted on for a
moment, and then absorbed into itself (see Ueberweg's ^History of
Philosophy~, ii. 415, 416; Aquinas, ^Summa~, i, q. lxxvi, a. 1; lxxix,
a. 2, 3; ^Contra Gentiles~, ii. 59 [the notes on pp. 122-124 of Father
Rickaby's translation are clear and valuable]). 
 
Statius, of course, cannot admit a doctrine which explains 
himself and his fellow-penitents out of existence.  The above passage 
is a kind of quintessence of the entire doctrine of Aquinas upon the 
Soul, and every clause may be said to be a fence erected to shut out 
some heresy.  First, the Platonic pre-existence of the soul is denied, 
perhaps with special reference to its form in Origen's teaching, namely
that the entrance of the soul into the body is a penalty inflicted on
it for its sin in a previous life -- a species of incarceration in
matter.  Against this, Statius, or rather Aquinas, holds that the soul
is not produced before the body.  The psychological moment, if the
phrase may be allowed, is when `in the embryo the articulation of the
brain is perfect.'  This is why the soul is called in line 72 a `^new~
spirit' -- it is an absolutely new creation, neither coming from another
existence, nor created along with all other souls at the beginning of
the world, and, as it were, waiting its turn to be born in the flesh,
but direct from the hand of God (Origen, ^De Prin.~ i. 7; Aquinas,
^Summa~, i, q. xlvii, a. 2; q. xc, a. 2-4; q. cxviii, a. 3; ^Contra
Gentiles~, ii. 44).  This brings us to a second heresy which is
repudiated.  Traducianism denies that the human soul is the immediate
creation of God, and traces it to the same laws of generation by which
the body is produced.  In this passage, as elsewhere, Dante follows
Aquinas in accepting the counter doctrine of Creationism.  The First
Mover, rejoicing to find such `an art of Nature' as the human brain in
the embryo, breathes into it `a new spirit filled with virtue' (^Summa~,
i, q. xc, a. 2; q. cxviii, a. 2, etc.; ^Contra Gentiles~, ii. 87-89). 
It is difficult to say what precisely is meant by `virtue.'  We get a
perfectly good meaning, however, if we take the word in the sense
Aquinas gave it, as covering all the powers contained in the rational
soul -- the intellectual and moral virtues.  The soul, when God breathes
it into the brain of the embryo, is filled with these virtues, not in
actuality, but in potency.  The great difficulty of theologians has been
to harmonize this theory of Creationism with the doctrine of original
sin.  If God infuses a soul `filled with virtue,' how comes it to be
infected with the sin of Adam?  The answer of Aquinas seems to be that
it is corrupted and disordered by the flesh with which it is united
(^Summa~, i-ii, q. lxxxiii, a. 1; ^Contra Gentiles~, iv. 52.  `The body
inflicts no physical damage on the soul, but merely entangles it in the
guiltiness of the seed of Adam.  The flesh, disordered by the loss of
original justice, being the recipient of the soul, the soul is received
in a disordered manner, and becomes guilty by implication or infection'
[^Manual of Cath. Theology~, by Wilhelm and Scannell, ii. 32]).  Into
this question, however, Dante does not here enter, but passes on to the
unity of the human soul.  This unity has been frequently denied.  If
there exists a threefold soul in man -- vegetable, animal, intellectual
-- then, it is argued, man is in reality three separate souls.  Against
this Dante asserts that the `new spirit' draws into its own substance
the active powers of the two lower souls so completely that they form
one single indivisible soul, which performs the functions of all three
-- living, feeling, reflection or self-consciousness.  This meets the
difficulty of Averro,es, that he saw no organ set apart for the
intellectual soul: instead of requiring a separate organ, it is itself,
so to speak, the spiritual organ of the vegetable and sensitive souls. 
The union of the human and divine is as close and indivisible as that
of the sun's heat with the juice of the grape, when it is changed into
wine (vv. 67-78; ^Summa~, i, q. lxxv, a. 2; q. lxxvi, a. 3.  Comp.
{comm. to} Canto iv. 1-16). 
 
	|79-84.~  The immortality of the soul being thus securely based in
the doctrine of Creationism, Statius proceeds to inform Dante of 
what happens to it at death.  The first question is how much 
survives the destruction of the body, and in what state does it 
pass into the spiritual world: 
 
     `And when Lachesis hath no more thread, 
     Itself it looses from the flesh, and in potency 
     Bears with itself both the human and the divine: 
     The other powers all of them dumb -- 
     The memory, the intelligence, and the will, 
     In act far keener than they were before.'
 
(In ^Summa~, i, q. lxxvii, a. 8, Aquinas says: `All faculties of the
soul inhere in the soul alone as in their principle.  But certain
faculties, as the intellect and will, inhere in the soul alone as in
their subject; and such powers necessarily remain in the soul when the
body is destroyed.  Certain other faculties, such as all the faculties
of the sensitive and nutritive part, are in the being composed of body
and soul as in their subject.  But the subject being destroyed, the
accident cannot remain.  Hence body-and-soul being broken up, such
faculties do not remain actually but only virtually in the soul, as in
their principle or root.')  This is once more a paraphrase of Aquinas. 
`The human' is the vegetable soul and the animal, which come through
parents.  The sensitive and nutritive faculties which belong to these
are not destroyed by death; they still exist in the soul, but since the
physical organs by which they passed into act are gone, they exist only
in potentiality, and must wait for the restoration of the body in the
Ressurection before they can become operative once more.  But with `the
divine' -- the intellectual soul inbreathed by God -- exactly the
opposite has taken place.  Memory, intelligence and will are quickened
into a far intenser activity, as if the mere removal of the flesh
concentrated the whole being on the spiritual life, undisturbed and
unrelieved by distractions of time and sense.  It is a profoundly solemn
conception, in which some Protestant theologians have found the truth
for which they believe the doctrine of Purgatory stands.  Writing of
souls in the intermediate state, for example, Bishop Martensen says:
`Their kingdom is not one of works and deeds, for they no longer possess
the conditions upon which works and deeds are possible.  Nevertheless,
they live a deep spiritual life; for the kingdom of the dead is a
kingdom of subjectivity, a kingdom of calm thought and self-fathoming,
a kingdom of ^remembrance~ in the full sense of the word, in such a
sense, I mean, that the soul new enters into its own inmost recesses,
resorts to that which is the very foundation of life, the true
substratum and source of all existence.  Hence arises the purgatorial
nature of this state.  As long as man is in this present world, he is
in a kingdom of externals, wherein he can escape from self-contemplation
and self-knowledge by the distractions of time, the noise and tumult of
the world; but at death he enters upon a kingdom the opposite of all
this.  The veil which this world of sense, with its varied and
incessantly moving manifoldness, spreads with soothing and softening
influence over the stern reality of life, and which man finds ready to
his hand to hide what he does not wish to see, -- this veil is torn
asunder from before him in death, and his soul finds itself in a kingdom
of pure realities.  The manifold voices of this worldly life, which
during this earthly life sounded together with the voices of eternity,
grow dumb, and the holy voice now sounds alone, no longer deadened by
the tumult of the world; and hence the realm of the dead becomes a realm
of judgment.'  The passage might have been written in exposition of
Dante's lines: it is precisely this profound inevitable
self-introspection by a memory, intelligence, and will sharpened by the
new conditions to an intense keenness, which forms one principal element
in the purgatorial discipline of every Terrace (^Christian Dogmatics~,
458; compare Isaac Taylor's ^Physical Theory of Another Life~, chap.
xiii., where he argues that the body is a curb on the moral faculties
through the physical exhaustion which strong emotion produces, and that
its removal will give these faculties a range and intensity
inconceivable in the present life.  This, however, is not identical with
the view of Aquinas, who holds that the restoration of the body in the
Resurrection is necessary to the final perfection of the nature of man).
 
Statius proceeds to say that the moment the soul is loosed from 
the flesh it falls, in a marvellous fashion, on one of the two shores 
-- that of Acheron for Hell, or that of Tiber for Purgatory on the way 
to Paradise; and `there first it knows its roads' -- that is, the 
course of hopeless pain or purifying discipline through which it is 
doomed to pass.  Aquinas speaks of the same immediate falling of the 
souls to their own place, according to the heaviness or lightness of 
their sins: `As in bodies there is weight, or lightness, by which they 
are borne to their own place, which is the end of their motion, so also
there is in souls merit or demerit, by which souls arrive at reward or 
punishment, which are the ends of their actions' (^Summa~, iii,
^Suppl.~, q. lxix, a. 2.  According to the doctrine of the Church, there
are two Judgments -- the Particular, immediately the soul leaves the
body; and the General, at the last day, when body and soul are 
re-united.  Aquinas guards against the idea that God judges twice over,
or inflicts a double punishment.  Three reasons are given: [1] each man
must be judged as an individual and also as a member of the race; [2]
there must be a public as well as a private manifestation of the Divine
justice; [3] punishment and reward cannot be fully received until the
reunion of soul and body [^Summa~, iii, ^Suppl.~, q. lxxxviii, a. 1). 
 
	|85-108.~  Then follows an exposition of the way in which the soul,
having reached its own place, rays out a temporary ethereal body 
for its intermediate state between death and the Resurrection: 
 
     `Soon as place there doth circumscribe it, 
     The virtue informative rays round about, 
     In form and size as in the living members. 
     And as the air, when it is charged with rain, 
     By another's rays which are reflected in it, 
     With divers colours shows itself adorned, 
     So there the neighbouring air doth set itself 
     In that form which the soul that has remained 
     Seals upon it by virtue of its power; 
     And then in fashion of the little flame 
     Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts, 
     After the spirit followeth its new form. 
     Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance, 
     It is called a shade; and from this it organizes 
     Each of the senses, even to the sight. 
     From this we speak, and from this we laugh, 
     From this we make the tears and sighs 
     Which throughout the mount thou may'st have heard. 
     According as the desires and other affections 
     Make an impress on us, the shade is shaped; 
     And this is the cause of what thou marvellest at.' 
 
Many of the commentators declare that this also is drawn from 
Aquinas; but the passage to which they usually refer (^Summa~, iii,
^Suppl.~, q. 79) deals with the Resurrection body, which is an entirely
different subject.  In this section of the ^Summa~, the question is 
discussed whether the same body as was worn on earth will be restored 
in its integrity, to the very hair and nails, and the answer is in the 
affirmative.  The subject Statius is expounding is the quite different 
one of the body of the intermediate state.  In point of fact, Aquinas 
says expressly that there is no such body.  His teaching is as 
follows.  At death, the sensitive powers remain potentially in the 
soul, which goes immediately to its own place.  This separated soul has
no body; nevertheless, in some manner unknown to us, but in harmony 
with spiritual substance, it exists in a corporeal place.  The lack of 
the bodily organs renders all action of the sensitive powers 
impossible, -- precisely the kind of action Dante has been causing the 
souls to pass through in both Hell and Purgatory (^Summa~, iii,
^Suppl.~, q. lxix, a. 1, 2; i, q. lxxvii, a. 1, 8).  He gives them 
visible forms and all their bodily senses: they see and hear, speak, 
laugh, weep, sigh -- in short, he makes them do the things which 
Aquinas declares they cannot do.  It is not a case, however, of 
intentional contradiction of his master; it is simply, as Dr. Hettinger
says, a case of `dramatic' necessity (^Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 281
[English Translation]).  The poem could never have been written if the
souls had not been visualized by some form of embodiment, however
ethereal.  The ^principle~ of this temporary embodiment is drawn from
the teaching of Aquinas on the Resurrection, namely, that the soul is
the `informative virtue' which shapes the body in exact harmony and
correspondence with its own spiritual state.  The soul, in fine, is `the
efficient cause' of the body.  `For the relation of the soul to the body
is as the relation of the art to the work of art....  Whatever appears
explicitly in the work of art, the same, in its entirety, is contained
implicitly and originally in the art itself.  Similarly also whatever
appears in the parts of the body, is in its entirety contained
originally, and in a certain manner implicitly, in the soul.  As
therefore the operation of the art would not be perfect, if the work of
art lacked anything which the art contains; so neither could a man be
perfect, unless the whole of what is implicitly contained in the soul,
were displayed outwardly in the body; nor, also, would the body answer
to the full proportions of the soul.  Since therefore it is necessary
in the resurrection that the body of man be wholly correspondent to the
soul -- because it will not rise save in accordance with the relation
which it holds to the rational soul -- it is necessary also that man
rise perfect, inasmuch as thus he is restored to the final perfection
which is to be obtained.  It is necessary, therefore, that all members
which are now in the body of man be restored in the resurrection'
(^Summa~, iii, ^Suppl.~, q. lxxx, a. 1).  It is obviously in accordance
with this principle of correspondence between soul and body that Dante
here frames the body of the intermediate state.  Properly speaking, it
is not really a body, but a shadowy simulacrum of one.  The `informative
virtue' of the soul rays itself out on the surrounding air as the sun
does upon a cloud, and forms an ethereal image of itself.  The point of
importance for the purpose Statius has in view is that this shade is the
exact image and reflection, as in a mirror, of the spiritual condition
of the soul.  As `the desires and other affections' set their seal upon
the soul, so the soul in turn sets its seal upon the encompassing air. 
The emaciation of the shades, which roused Dante's wonder, is therefore
simply the visible image of the hunger which consumed their souls. 
Obviously it cannot be any hunger of the body, since it is expressly
stated that the sensitive powers are all `mute.'  It can only be
spiritual hunger -- hunger for what the two Trees represent, freedom
from inordinate desire, and the attainment of the virtue of true
temperance.  To this spiritual hunger they are goaded by the keener
activity of `memory, intelligence, and will.' 
 
This spiritual correspondence of the body to the soul is 
probably the solution of certain apparent anomalies in the ^Commedia~, 
for this exposition by Statius applies in principle to all the souls in
the intermediate state.  It has been often remarked that the souls of 
the lost have bodies quite different from those of penitents -- not 
etherealized shades which cannot be embraced, but bodies so gross and 
palpable that Dante falls on one and tears out handfuls of hair.  The 
reason is obvious: the gross material `body' is the spiritual image of 
the gross material soul which has made evil its good (again Dante is 
following Aquinas: `Inasmuch as their soul will have its will turned 
away from God and deprived of its proper end, their bodies will not be 
^spiritual~ [1 Cor. xv. 44], in the sense of being wholly subject to 
the spirit, but rather their soul will be in effect carnal.'  Their 
bodies will not be `^agile~,' but `ponderous and heavy and 
insupportable to the soul.'  They will be liable to suffering ^from 
sensible things.~  They will also be `^opaque and darksome~,' to 
correspond with their souls which are void of the Divine light.  `This 
is the meaning of what the Apostle says, that ^we shall all rise again,
but we shall not all be changed~ [1 Cor. xv. 51]: for the good alone
shall be changed to glory, and the bodies of the wicked shall rise
without glory' [^Contra Gentiles~, iv. 89].  Aquinas, it is true, is
speaking of the Resurrection body, but Dante applies the ^principle~ to
`separated souls' in the intermediate state).  When the power of sin is
broken by penitence, the new and higher spiritual condition of the soul
shows itself in the refining and etherealizing of the `body' which is
its reflected image.  And finally, in Paradise where the process of
purification is completed, the perfect holiness enhaloes itself in a
sphere of Divine light, which serves as a temporary `body of glory,' and
varies according to the special quality of holiness attained.  In Canto
xiv. of the ^Paradiso~ the relation between this star-like body of the
intermediate state and the body of the resurrection is discussed.  The
whole of the present passage, from the growth of the embryo on to the
intermediate body, is regarded by Dean Plumptre as a mere digression,
very much out of place, and also as `something like a display of a wide
encyclopaedic knowledge.'  In reality, it is Dante's explanation of the
principle on which he visualized all the spirits of the departed, that,
namely, of the strictest correspondence between the soul and the `body'
which its `informative virtue' creates for itself.  The gross palpable
bodies of the lost, the etherealized bodies of the penitents, and the
bodies of light of the redeemed, are thus seen to be essential parts of
the spiritual symbolism. 

	|109-120.~  The three Pilgrims now emerge from the stairway, and
find themselves upon a very dangerous path.  It is the Seventh and last
Terrace, on which Sensuality is purified by fire.  The bank which 
ascends on the poet's left hand to the Earthly Paradise above shoots 
forth a flame which encircles the whole Cornice; while from the Cornice
itself rises a blast which drives the flame up against the rock, leaving
a narrow pathway along the edge of the cliff that falls to the Terrace
below.  Along this pathway Virgil, Statius, and Dante walk in single
file, and in the order named; while the penitent souls keep marching
round within the fire.  Dante tells us that his attention was divided
between the spirits in the flame and his own footsteps; and Virgil warns
him more than once to keep a tight rein on his eyes, for a slight thing
might cause a false step here.  The meaning is probably that the sin of
the Terrace is one which usually gains an entrance through the eyes
[Matt. v. 28; 2 Pet. ii. 14]; and that there is also the danger of
falling back into the kindred vice of Gluttony out of which he has just
climbed. 
 
Before we go further, it is necessary to make up our minds 
concerning the symbolism of the fire and of the wind which blows it 
back and up.  It is by no means easy to do so.  It seems to be commonly
taken for granted that the fire represents the sin itself, the burning
of the unholy passion which inflamed the sinners on earth.  It is a 
familiar figure, and one is not prepared to deny that it is one element
of the symbolism.  If this is all, however, it carries one great 
difficulty with it.  Dante tells us the penitents are most careful not
to emerge from the flame: are we to suppose that he means to say they 
were careful to remain within the fire of their own sensual passion? 
That seems to be an impossible meaning, and we must search further.  In
the first place, it is to be remembered that this being the last 
Terrace, we are now drawing near to the Earthly Paradise, the Garden of
Eden, and therefore to the Tree of Life in the midst of it.  That Tree,
according to Scripture, was guarded by Cherubim and a flaming sword, 
which turned every way to keep the approach [Gen. iii. 24].  There is
no mention of such a sword elsewhere in the poem, and it is difficult 
to believe that Dante would entirely omit so striking a piece of 
allegory.  One is tempted to find the flaming sword in this circle of 
fire turning every eay round the Mountain, and most effectually keeping
the way of the Tree of Life.  The Angel who stands outside the flaming
circle may be taken as one of the Cherubim, and the one who welcomes 
Dante on the inside as another -- this being the only terrace on which
two Angels are stationed. 
 
The fire, then, is a Divine and holy fire, doubtless of 
judgment, but also of mercy.  Since its object is to burn out 
unholy love, the one question is: what is capable of performing 
this great purifying operation?  It is matter of undoubted 
knowledge and experience that nothing but a pure and holy love 
can burn out an impure and unholy one.  We cannot be far wrong if 
we regard this hedge of flame as the fire of Divine charity, 
burning away every impure passion which keeps man from the Tree 
of Life.  This accounts for two things, -- the pain, and the 
determination to endure the pain.  When a pure love and an impure 
struggle for possession of a human soul, there cannot but result 
a pain as of fire; but the soul knows well that there must be no 
attempt to escape from it -- its one hope lies in keeping itself 
within that fire of Divine love, till it has burnt it clean and 
ceased to be a pain. 
 
Almost more difficult to understand it the blast which blows 
the flame upward.  We may set aside at once the idea that it is the 
wind of Temperance from the Angel's wings on the Terrace below, for the
simple reason that Dante expressly says it came from ^this~ Terrace: 
`the Cornice breathes a blast upwards.' We must find the meaning, 
therefore, somewhere in the Cornice itself and the sin it purges away. 
It is difficult to avoid the feeling that the wind here has some 
connection of thought with that which whirls the Sensual on without 
respite through the dark air of the Inferno [^Inf.~ v. 28-33].  There
it represents the whirlwind of their own lust, which gives them no 
rest.  Here, may we not take it as meaning substantially the same 
thing, with certain differences?  It springs from the Cornice itself, 
from the ground, from the dust of which we are made, to indicate that 
the blast of sensual passion is low and earthly.  But to these 
penitents it is no longer a whirlwind, but a steady breeze.  Its 
direction is upward -- their very passion is heavenward, whereas that 
of the lost sensualists flung them in every direction, `hither, 
thither, down, up.'  And, most significant of all, this wind of passion
fans the flame of their purifying penitence, for it is a familiar 
experience in repentance that our past sins, and the remains of them 
within us, at once increase our pain and urge us on to more strenuous 
efforts to work the evil out.  It is just the wind of their own earthly
passions which fans the flame of charity into a consuming fire, and 
blows it upward until it envelopes their whole nature.  It is, of 
course, a paradox, but a paradox amply borne out by the experience of 
every true penitent. 
 
	|121-123.~  The souls `in the heart of the great burning' first
sang a hymn, '^Summae Deus clementiae~,' then proclaimed aloud an
example of Chastity, and then sang the hymn again.  This hymn is sung
at Matins on Saturday, and, being a prayer against the lusts of the
flesh, has a special fitness for this Terrace (in the modern Breviary
the line reads `Summae ^Parens~ clementiae,' and it is sometimes thought
that Dante made a slip of memory.  Dr. Moore, however, shows that the
original form was as he gives it, the alteration being made in 1631
[^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, pp. 260, 261].  Newman's translation
of the hymn almost completely disguises its very plain references to the
sin of this Terrace). 

	|127-129.~  The first great example of the virtue to be won is, as
usual, taken from the life of the Virgin: `^Virum non cognosco~' (Luke
i. 34). 

	|130-132.~  The second is drawn from mythology: the indignation
with which Diana drove her nymph Helic,e or Callisto out of the wood
when she discovered her amour with Jupiter (Ovid, ^Metam.~ ii. 401-530. 
It gives us something of a shock to find, after such stories as these,
that Dante does not shrink from calling Christ the `highest Jove': `^O
sommo Giove~' [^Purg.~ vi. 118]). 

	|133-135.~  Then follows the praise of 
 
               wives and husbands who were chaste, 
     As virtue and the marriage vow imposes. 
 
Dante is here thinking of no monkish asceticism within the marriage 
bond, but simply of that ideal of chastity which the very nature of the
bond involves.  There is a remarkable passage in the ^Convito~ (iv. 28)
which shows that he saw no incompatibility between marriage and 
`religion' in its true scriptural sense.  After telling how Sir 
Lancelot and Guido da Montefeltro lowered the sails of their worldly 
activities as they drew near the port of death, and devoted themselves
to the religious life, he adds that this religious life is equally 
incumbent on those within the marriage bond: `It is not possible to 
excuse any one because of the bond of matrimony which holds good in old
age; because not he alone turns to religion who makes himself in habit
and life like St. Benedict and St. Augustine and St. Francis and St. 
Dominic, but also it is possible to turn to a good and true religion 
whilst remaining in matrimony, for God wishes nothing religious of us 
but the heart.  And therefore St.  Paul says to the Romans: "He is not
a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is 
outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and 
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; 
whose praise is not of men, but of God"' (Rom. ii. 28, 29.  The passage
is a protest against the limitation of `the religious life' to the 
cloister, To make `religion' equivalent to a religious order, is to 
declare the family life irreligious). 
 
	|136-139.~  The closing words of Canto XXV. seem to me to be
generally misunderstood: 
 
     With such cure is behoves, with such a diet 
     That the wound at last be sewn up -- 
 
the cure or treatment being the cautery of the fire, and the diet 
and prayer of the hymn and the examples of chastity.  The common 
translation of the closing line is `the last wound'; but it is 
difficult to avoid the conclusion that `^dassezzo~' is an adverb, 
meaning `at last.'  In other words, Dante at this point is not 
thinking of the Seven Deadly Sins as seven separate wounds, but 
as one great wound which is now `at last' sewn up and finally 
closed by the `cure' and `diet' of this Terrace.  Although they 
were inscribed as separate sins on his own brow, yet he now feels 
the unity of them, as if the whold wound remained open until this 
final vice was sewn up.  The fact that it is represented as the 
last evil of which human nature is purified does not mean, as we 
might imagine, that Dante regards it as the worst.  The exact 
opposite is the case.  In the ^Inferno~ Sensuality is set highest 
of all the sins, because it is the excess of a natural appetite 
and one Divinely ordained for the continuance of the race.  It is 
for the same reason it is also highest here, and the last to be 
burnt into purity.
