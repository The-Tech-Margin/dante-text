	|1-39.~  This discourse created `a new thirst' in Dante.  What 
^is~ this Love which is thus the source of good and evil alike? 
Virgil replies in effect that it is the capacity of desire, and 
exposes `the error of the blind who make themselves guides' -- 
the Epicureans, namely, who held that `each love is in itself a 
laudable thing,' that every desire is good and to be gratified.  A
potential capacity of love is an original endowment of the 
soul.  It is wakened to actuality by the faculty of apprehension 
which draws into us an image of some external thing.  If this 
image kindles pleasure so that the soul bend toward it, `that 
bending is Love,' and the sense of pleasure binds anew the 
original natural capacity.  As fire by its own substance moves 
upward, so the `spiritual motion' which we call desire never 
rests until it enjoy the thing beloved. 
 
       `Now may apparent be to thee how hidden 
       The truth is from the people who aver 
       Each love is in itself a laudable thing: 
       Because its matter may perchance appear 
       Aye to be good; but yet not every seal 
       Is good, albeit good may be the wax.' {vv. 34-39}
 
The difficulty here is to understand what Dante means by the word 
`matter.'  It appears to be the ideal image which enters the mind 
by the faculty of apprehension, and to which the soul bends in 
joy and desire.  This ideal image is the `matter' on which the 
flame of desire feeds, and it always ^appears~ good.  It may be 
only an appearance, like the objects of Pride, Envy, and Anger, 
which are really evil.  Further, even when the `matter,' the 
ideal image in the mind, is good, the seal which Love sets on the 
good wax may be an evil one.  The reference is to defective and 
excessive love: the former stamps the good wax with the seal of 
Sloth, the latter with that of Avarice, Gluttony, and Sensuality.  
The Epicurean doctrine, therefore, that every desire of pleasure 
is good cannot be substantiated: the good may be only apparent 
good, and even when it is real, the seal with which it is stamped 
may be the evil one of Love in defect or in excess. 
 
	|40-75.~  This exposition, while it satisfies Dante in regard to
the nature of Love, only creates a new doubt: 
 
       `If Love from without is offered to us, 
       And the soul goes not with another foot, 
       If straight she go or crooked, it is not her merit.'
 
In other words, Virgil in his discourse of Love seemed to have 
left no room for free-will.  An image from the outside world 
enters the mind through the apprehensive faculty, and draws the 
soul to itself by an instinctive movement of pleasure and desire.  
If this is all -- if `the soul goes not with another foot' -- she 
has no option.  Whether she go right or wrong, there can be no 
question of merit or demerit: the whole movement is instinctive 
and necessary.  In reply, Virgil disclaims the power of giving a 
complete solution of the problem, -- it has a theological side 
which lies beyond his vision.  His words show plainly 
that whatever more Virgil and Beatrice may stand for, they 
represent the scholastic distinction between Reason and Faith, 
human wisdom and divine: 
 
                    `So far as Reason seeth here, 
       Myself can tell thee; beyond that wait thou 
       Only for Beatrice, for `tis a work of Faith.'
 
The solution which Reason gives is drawn substantially from 
Aquinas, and is well stated in Dean Plumptre's paraphrase: `The 
soul is, in scholastic terminology, the "substantial form," 
^i.e.~, the essence, of man's nature.  Without it the man is 
not (Aquinas, ^Summa~, i, q. lxxvi, a. 4).  As such, it has its own
specific virtue, ^i.e.~, its own ideas, tendencies, and capacities. 
These are known by their effects, as the nature of the plant is known
by its leaves and flowers and fruits, as the instinct of the bee is
seen in its making honey; but what is the source either of the primal
conceptions or the primal desires, whether innate, inspired, or 
determined by stellar influences or a law of heredity, Dante will 
not say.  The first desires, even if directed to counterfeits of 
good, are simply neutral, deserving neither praise nor blame; but 
with them there is innate in the soul (here Dante is not 
doubtful, for with him it was a primary fact of consciousness) a 
power that judges, warns, advises, -- what we know as conscience.  
This stands as warder at the gate through which desire passes 
into act, brings with it the sense of merit or demerit, is the 
foundation of human liberty, and therefore of all systems of 
ethics which are worthy of the name, chiefly that of the "Master 
of those who know" (^Inf.~ iv. 131; comp. ^De Mon.~ i. 12).  
Hence, even if we allow that every desire in men may be traced to 
a law of cause and effect, and admit so far the postulates of 
Determinism, there is yet a "noble virtue" in man, which 
theology, embodied in Beatrice, recognizes as keeping man from 
being bound hand and foot in the iron chain of necessity.'  This 
doctrine of free-will is the keystone of Dante's entire moral and 
theological system, without which it would fall into ruins.  
When, in the Heaven of the Moon, Beatrice speaks of it, she makes 
no attempt whatever to solve the mystery, she simply emphasizes, 
in the strongest manner, the unspeakable value of free-will as 
the Creator's supreme gift: 
 
       `The greatest gift that in His largess God 
       Creating made, and unto His own goodness 
       Nearest conformed, and that which He doth prize 
       Most highly, is the freedom of the will, 
       Wherewith the creatures of intelligence, 
       Both all and only, were and are endowed.'
                                   (^Par.~ V. 19-24.)
 
	|76-87.~  The hour was now approaching midnight.  The very moon
was moving slowly, as if she too felt the slothful power of the 
Terrace (according to Butler, however, the hour was between 2 and 3
A.M.).  Dante himself began to succumb to the spirit of the 
place, standing, as he says, like a man who wanders half-asleep.  
It is questioned whether this is to be taken as a sign of sloth.  
It might, of course, be nothing more than the `something of 
Adam' (^Purg.~ IX. 10) in Dante which sent him to sleep the other two
nights he spent on the Mountain, were it not that he himself connects
his drowsiness in a very pointed way with the clear and satisfying 
nature of Virgil's reasoning: 
 
       Whence I, who reason manifest and plain 
       In answer to my questionings had gathered, 
       Stood like a man who wanders half-asleep. {vv. 85-87}
 
It is that special form of Sloth to which the thinker and 
philosopher is exposed through the very activity of the brain.  
We are familiar with the fact that intellectual doubt paralyzes 
the active faculties; but we forget that intellectual certainty 
not seldom tends to much the same result.  The philosopher, 
having spent his energy in thought, feels himself excused from 
becoming the man of action.  In the present case, for example, 
free-will becomes a problem to be solved, rather than a faculty 
to be exercised; and the mind sinks to rest in the intellectual 
satisfaction of the answer.  Dante compares this unreal relation 
between thought and action to the state of a man who wanders 
about half-asleep, his energies `put in truce', and all the 
outlines of active waking life blurred and dim.  In plain words, 
the wisest, most rational moral philosophy which refuses to 
fulfil itself in conduct, merely ushers us into a drowsy and 
unreal world. 
 
	|88-98.~  From this wandering in sleepy languor Dante is suddenly
roused by a rush of loud active waking life.  The penitents of the
Terrace, like a troop of horses, `ridden by good will and 
righteous love,' sweep on the poets from behind.  Dante compares 
them significantly to the Theban votaries of Bacchus as they 
rushed along the banks of the Ismenus and Asopus in Boeotia, 
praying the god for rain upon their vineyards.  Like so many of 
Dante's comparisons, the spiritual meaning lies beneath the 
surface.  All this mad intoxication of zeal and energy and prayer 
was poured out by the heathen for nothing greater than rain for 
their crops -- `merely that the Thebans had need of Bacchus.'  
But these penitents had need of God, and therefore their eager 
rush, which looked like wild Bacchanalian fury, justified itself 
by the greatness of the blessing which it pursued.  It reminds us 
of St. Paul's contrast between the two forms of intoxication: `Be 
not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the 
Spirit' (Eph. v. 18; the reference to the invocation of Bacchus comes
from Statius, ^Thebaid~, ix. 434ff.).
 
	|99-102.~  In front of the bank ran two of the souls, probably the
most eager in their penitence, crying out with tears the examples of
zeal and alacrity which formed the `whip' of their meditation.  
They are taken from the history of the two chosen peoples, Israel 
and Rome, -- one from the humble life of Mary, a village maiden, 
the other from the great wars of the first Roman Emperor, who 
gave his name to all his successors: 
 
       `Mary ran with haste into the hill-country,' 
       And `Caesar, in order to subdue Ilerda, 
       Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.'

(Caesar's rush to Spain is again referred to in ^Par.~ vi. 61-64.)
 
The reference in the last two lines is to Caesar's defeat of 
Pompey's lieutenants, Afranius and Petrieius, in Ilerda (now 
Lerida) in Catalonia in the year 49 B.C.  Doubtless what excited 
Dante's admiration was Caesar's refusal to be diverted from the 
central purpose of the campaign by a mere side issue: an 
admiration quickened by the vexation and anger with which he 
watched Henry VII. wasting his time at the siege of Cremona, when 
he should be striking at the root of rebellion in Florence.  
Improvising a navy, and detaching three of his legions, Caesar 
left Marseilles blockaded by land and sea, seized the passes of 
the Pyrenees, and by a stratagem surrounded the Pompeian army and 
compelled it to lay down its arms. 

	|103-105.~  In reply to the proclamation of these examples of
alacrity by the two heralds in front, the main body behind urge
themselves on in emulation of such zeal: 

       `Haste! Haste! that the time may not be lost 
       Through little love,' forthwith the others cried, 
       `That study of good deeds may make grace bud again.'
 
Dean Plumptre sees in this last line the scholastic doctrine of 
`grace of congruity,' condemned by the Church of England in 
Article XIII., viz., `that the efforts of men to do good are 
effective in making them meet to receive grace for doing it.'  The 
interpretation is somewhat doubtful.  The idea seems rather to be 
the danger of contemplation of good deeds, without an eager and 
immediate effort to imitate them.  Mere `study' of them may end 
in the `little love' which produces sloth.  It is only when 
`study' is accompanied by action that it `makes grace bud again.'  
The running, indeed, has a special significance which is seldom 
noticed.  Aquinas (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxv, a. 4) quotes Isidore 
to the effect that sadness, which the latter identifies with 
sloth, produces `restlessness of body,' and this in turn is 
traced to `wandering of mind.'  These souls are restless yet, but 
for the opposite reason -- that their minds do ^not~ wander.  
Their wills are set resolutely on one end, and they so run that 
they may obtain.  This steadfast, race, therefore, is the undoing 
of their old weary restless habit of running to and fro. 
 
	|106-117.~  As the penitents rush past, Virgil begs them to tell
him where is the nearest opening, as his companion, who is alive, 
wishes to ascend as soon as the sunlight returns.  One of the 
souls answers breathlessly, `Come behind us,' and apologizes for 
his seeming discourtesy in not stopping to talk; not even the 
marvellous news that Dante is alive can turn him aside.  A lazy 
man is glad of any excuse to throw down his task and gossip with 
any passer by; and a busy man is often accused of discourteousness
because he refuses to allow his work to be interfered with by mere
talk.  Aquinas names ^verbositas~, talkativeness, as a sign of this
sin, and traces it to the wandering of the mind about things forbidden,
which is one of the `daughters of Acedia' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxv, a.
4.  In i-ii, q. xxxv, a. 8, Aquinas quotes a saying of Gregory of
Nyssa: `acedia est tristitia vocem amputans.'  This effect of sadness
upon the voice is discussed by the Bishop of Oxford in his Essay on
Acedia afterwards referred to {see comm. to vv. 130-138}.  The shouting
of the penitents on this Terrace shows that they have recovered from
their voicelessness.  The sould of the Sad in Hell can only gurgle
their `hymn' in their throats [^Inf.~ VII. 117-126]).  It is for this
reason that the conversation here is the shortest on any of the
Terraces.

	|118-129.~  Running on without pause until his voice is lost in
the distance, this penitent soul tells who he is, and flings a warning
word to the lord of Verona: 
 
       `I was Abbot in San Zero at Verona, 
       Under the empire of the good Barbarossa, 
       Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse. 
       And such an one has already one foot in the grave, 
       Who shall erelong lament that monastery, 
       And sad will be to have had power there; 
       Because his son, deformed in his whole body, 
       And in mind worse, and who was basely born, 
       He has put in place of its true pastor.'

(`The ^good~ Barbarossa' is probably not ironical, as some think.  His
energetic struggle against the temporal power of the Papacy would
certainly free him in Dante's regard from the charge of sloth.)
 
It is not certainly known who this Abbot is, though he is 
generally identified with Gherardo II. who ruled the monastery of 
San Zeno in the time of the Emperor Frederick I., and who died in 
1187.  Plumptre says that `the few facts recorded for him, his 
restoration of the church and the erection of a new campanile, 
seem to speak of activity rather than sloth.  From his studies of 
Veronese history,' he adds, `Dante perhaps knew, while at the 
Court of Can Grande, more of his inner life, and wished to point 
the moral that there may be spiritual sluggishness in the midst 
of outward diligence.'  The reference of the last lines of the 
quotation is to Alberto della Scala of Verona, who, at the ideal 
date of the poem, was an old man with `one foot in the grave,' -- 
in fact, he died the following year.  The sin with which he is 
charged is nepotism.  He appointed his son Giuseppo Abbot of San 
Zeno, a man with three serious disqualifications for holy orders 
-- a deformed body, an imbecile mind, and the stain of 
illegitimacy.  (For deformity, see Lev. xxi. 17-23, ^Summa~, iii.
^Suppl.~, q. xxxix, a. 6; illegitimacy, ^Summa~, iii. ^Suppl.~, q.
xxxix, a. 5.  There is some doubt as to whether the lack of reason is
a bar to orders.  Aquinas holds it is not, except in the case of the
episcopate, to which the cure of souls is attached [^Suppl.~, q. xxxix,
a. 2]).  For this sin, the Abbot prophesies, Alberto will 
soon be weeping, either in Purgatory or, more probably, in Hell.  
For some reason difficult to understand, Dante is far from sorry 
to hear this news: 
 
       This I heard, and to retain it pleased me. 
 
When we remember that Alberto was the father of Dante's great 
hero and patron Can Grande, we can scarcely help thinking that 
silence might have been more gracious and becoming (^Par.~ XVII. 70-
81).  Possibly some personal insult inflicted on him by the base-born
Abbot made the poet bitter; but this need not blind us to the 
fact that scarcely anything roused a more terrible indignation in 
Dante than the spiritual ruin inflicted on the Church by such 
abuses. 
 
	|130-138.~  The whole troop has now swept past, the rear being 
brought up by two laggards who proclaim aloud examples of the 
ruinous power of Sloth or Accidia, to use Dante's word, which 
form the bit and `bridle' of this sin.  The words in which Virgil 
describes their action are translated by some `biting at sloth,' 
by others, `putting a bit on sloth,' -- the ambiguity lurking in 
the word, ^morso~, which means both `biting' and `a bit' (v. 132:
`dando all'accidia di morso').  It is perhaps impossible from the mere
phrase itself to justify the suggestion that these spirits were biting
at the bit; but that probably represents their actual moral attitude. 
Dante had compared the whole band to a troop of horses, `ridden by good
will and righteous love.'  If we carry out the figure, these two
laggard souls behind the rest are like two restive horses biting at
their bits and not yet perfectly subdued to their rider's will.  They
do indeed call out the examples of Sloth which form the bridle of the
vice, but, even in the act of calling, they rebel somewhat against the
unwelcome restraint.  The experience is familiar enough to all of us. 
 
As usual, the examples of Accidia are drawn from sacred and
profane story; or rather, to state it from Dant's point of view, from
the history of the two chosen peoples.  Accidia, as we 
shall see, is a very complex sin; and the special aspect of it 
which is here singled out is that cowardly shrinking and failure 
of the soul in the presence of high and arduous enterprises, by 
which men prove themselves unworthy of the great destinies to 
which the grace of Heaven has called them.  Dante sets before us 
here, as the Bishop of Oxford says in his well-known essay on 
this sin (^The Spirit of Discipline~, pp. 18, 19), `instances in which
a great vocation was dismally forfeited through faint-heartedness,
through lack of faith and courage.  For accidie was a part, at least,
of their sin who "would not go up" to win "that pleasant land," but
"murmured in their tents"; to whom God sware "that they should not
enter into His rest," "because of unbelief"; and of their sin, too, who
forewent the glory of "a share in founding the great Roman Empire," the
degenerate, slothful band, who stayed behind in Sicily -- 
 
       "Who dared not hazard life for future fame."'
 
It is a temptation with which Dante himself was well acquainted.  
At the very outset of his great pilgrimage, he tells us that his 
heart and flesh fainted and failed: he was not worthy of the high 
quest of salvation.  Had it not been for Virgil's taunt, 
 
       `Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,' 
 
he would have folded up his pound in a napkin and basely laid it 
past.  At root, the sin is that of undervaluing and despising the 
gifts wherewith God has endowed us, and the work for which they 
are bestowed (^Inf.~ II. 45; ^De Mon.~ i. 1).
 
It becomes necessary, now that we have the completed 
narrative before us, to examine more carefully the nature of this 
sin, if for no other reason than that the word Sloth does not 
convey to our modern minds anything like the full mediaeval 
conception of it.  Perhaps the simplest way is to begin by 
examining the various forms of the mediaeval name for Sloth.  
The form used by Aquinas is ^Acedia~, the transliteration of the 
Greek %alpha%kappa%eta%delta%$iota%alpha\ -- the state, as the 
word means, of not caring for anything.  It is undoubtedly this 
feeling of ^don't care~ which is the root idea of the sin: it may 
have many causes, and may assume many forms, but fundamentally it 
is the break-down of interest in the things which are worthy of a 
man's endeavour.  The form used by Dante is ^Accidia.~  The word 
occurs only once -- in the present passage, Canto xviii. 132 -- 
and the adjective ^accidioso~ in ^Inf.~ VII. 123.  Readers of Chaucer
are familiar with the sin under the form of ^Accidie~ in ^The Parson's
Tale~.  `Its Greek origin being forgotten,' says the ^New English
Dictionary~, `the word was variously "derived" from ^acidum~ sour...
and from ^accidere~ to come upon one as an ^accident~ or ^access~,
whence the med. Lat. corruption, ^accidia~, and O. Fr. and Eng.
^acci-de, acci-die~....  With the restoration of Greek learning, the
Latin became again ^acedia.~'  Whatever errors of etymology may have
altered the form of the word, the mediaeval conception of the sin
remained fundamentally unchanged, -- the state of ^don't care~, a
torpor and indifference to good, a dull melancholy paralysis of 
healthy interest in life and work, in God and man. 
 
It is to be carefully noted that Dante has set Accidia as 
the central evil of the Seven Deadly Sins.  One reason is that 
Sloth, being a sin of both flesh and spirit, has ethical 
relations to the three Terraces beneath with their lusts of the 
spirit, and to the three above with their lusts of the flesh.  A 
second reason is involved in Virgil's doctrine of Love.  The sins 
of the spirit, Pride, Envy, Anger, spring from perverted Love -- 
Love directed to some positive evil object.  Dante has now 
overcome this positive perversion of Love to evil, and has turned 
Love in the direction of good.  But the turning is very feeble at 
first, the Love of good is there, indeed, but weak, slothful, 
half-indifferent.  The work of this central Terrace is to fan 
`the smoking flax' into a bright flame of righteous Love which 
will burn out the remaining sins, the lusts of the flesh on the 
Terraces above.  This conquest of the flesh is utterly impossible 
if the soul is sunk in a `Slough of Despond,' an unexpectant 
melancholy, a spiritual indifference and acquiescence in its own 
low moral state.  The inner life must be strung up to the key of 
hope and expectancy, of the infinite value of the human soul, of 
its being unspeakably worth while to strain every nerve after 
goodness, and of a joyous anticipation of final deliverance.  All 
this is the exact opposite of Dante's ^Accidia~, and without it 
he felt he could not face the remaining Terraces.  When love of 
the Highest Good grows into a strong controlling interest and 
power, it cannot but keep in their due bounds the three great 
lusts of the flesh, which, according to Dante's ethical scheme, 
are simply the love of lower goods in disorder and excess. 
 
Turning now to the range and contents of this sin, we 
find considerable doubt and controversy.  The dispute is to some 
extent a verbal one, and has its source in the very subtlety and 
complexity of the sin, and the degrees in which men yield to it.  
So far as Dante is concerned, the difficulty springs from his 
description of the souls at the bottom of the Stygian Lagoon in 
the Inferno (^Inf.~ VII. 121-124): 
 
       Fixed in the slime they say: `Sad were we 
       In the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened, 
       Bearing within ourselves the slothful smoke: 
       Now are we sad in the black mire.'
 
`The slothful smoke' is `accidioso fummo'; and the question is 
whether the word ^accidioso~ justifies us in identifying the sin 
thus described with the ^Accidia~ of this Fourth Terrace of 
Purgatory.  Dr. Moore argues strenuosly against this 
identification, maintaining that the sad souls in the Stygian 
mire `represent a type or species of anger, viz. sullen, 
suppressed, or sulky anger; a gloomy, resentful, discontented 
disposition, refusing to rejoice in the bright sunshine, and 
other occasions of happiness and contentment in this upper 
world.'  One can accept this without endorsing his contention 
that this sullen anger is incompatible with `the more technically 
restricted term ^acidia~' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 175).  Is
it more technically restricted?  Is not this `sullen, suppressed, or
sulky anger,' this `gloomy, resentful, discontented disposition,' just
this sin of ^accidia~ when it has deepened into its final form of
hopless and incurable bitterness?  On this Terrace it has not reached
this desperate finality for which nothing is left but `the black mire.' 
The Bishop of Oxford is certainly not wrong when he says that the three
main elements of the sin are `gloom~ and ^sloth~ and ^irritation~,'
which can indeed be distinguished in thought, but 
meet and mingle in experience (^The Spirit of Discipline~, p. 54). 
They are all found in Aquinas: `Sloth is a heaviness and sadness, that
so weighs down the soul that it has no mind to do anything.  It carries
with it a disgust of work.  It is a torpor of the mind neglecting to
set about good.  Such sadness is always evil.'  Out of this sadness
comes `rancour,' according to Gregory, as one of `the daughters of
acedia,' and one of the affects of rancour is bitterness,
acrimoniousness (^amaritudo~; ^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxv, a. 4).  There
can be no doubt that all three elements were recognized as constituent
parts of this sin.  Chaucer, for example, says in his ^Parson's Tale~:
`After the synne of envye and of ire, now wol I speken of the synne of
accidie; for envye blyndeth the herte of man, and ire troubleth a man,
and accidie maketh hym hevy, thoghtful and wrawful.  Envye and ire
maken bitternesse in herte, which bitternesse is mooder of accidie and
bynymeth (taketh away from) hym the love of alle goodnesse.  Thanne is
accidie the angwissh of troubled herte; 
and Seint Augustyn seith, it is anoy of goodnesse and joye of 
harm.  Certes this is a dampnable synne, for it dooth wrong to 
Jhesu Crist, in as much as it bynymeth the service that men oghte 
doon to Crist with alle diligence, as seith Salomon.  But accidie 
dooth no swich diligence.  He dooth alle thyng with anoy, and 
with wrawnesse, slaknesse, and excusacion, and with ydelnesse, 
and unlust; for which the book seith, "Accursed be he that dooth 
the service of God necligently."'  This passage shows the close 
connection that exists between anger and accidie.  `Wrawnesse ' 
is just that sullen species of anger, half peevish, half morose, 
and wholly bitter, which Dante sets in the black slime of Styx.  
It is absent from this Terrace, not, as Dr. Moore thinks, because 
Accidia has some `technical sense in which it is ranked as one of 
the Seven Deadly Sins,' but because when it reaches this depth of 
bitter and angry resentment against the very sunshine, it is past 
redemption.  It is not a matter of `technical sense' at all, but 
of moral degree.  Dante cared little for mere technicalities of 
rigid ethical systems, and knew as well as Aquinas and Chaucer 
how sins run into one another. 
 
The complete disappearance of the word `accidie' from our 
modern speech has led to the idea that the sin represented by it 
is a spiritual disease of the cloister, which cannot exist 
outside its walls.  There can be no doubt that its occurence in 
monasteries was so common, and its form so marked and virulent, 
that there is some justification for this view.  Dante adopts it 
so far, at least, as to choose the Abbot of a monastery as his 
one typical example of the sin; and when Spenser describes the 
chariot of Pryde Duessa, the portrait of Idlenesse, the rider of 
the first of the six beasts by which it is drawn, is avowedly 
that of a monk (^Faerie Queene~, Bk. I, Canto iv, stanzas 18-20; the
whole of Spenser's description of the Procession of the Deadly Sins in
this Canto should be carefully studied and compared with this division
of the ^Purgatorio~): 
 
               The first, that all the rest did guyde, 
       Was sluggish Idlenesse, the nourse of sin; 
       Upon a slouthfull Asse he chose to ryde, 
       Arayd in habit blacke, and amis thin, 
       Like to an holy Monck, the service to begin. 

       And in his hand his Portesse still he bare, 
       That much was worne, but therein little redd; 
       For of devotion he had little care, 
       Still drownd in sleepe, and most of his daies dedd: 
       Searse could he once uphold his heavie hedd, 
       To looken whether it were night or day. 
       May seeme the wayne was very evill ledd, 
       When such an one had guiding of the way, 
       That knew not whether right he went, or else astray. 

       From worldly cares himselfe he did esloyne, 
       And greatly shunned manly exercise; 
       From everie work he chalenged essoyne, 
       For contemplation sake.
 
The last three words show us the source of this particular 
quality of Sloth.  Men give themselves to `a one-sidedly 
contemplative life, without having the power or calling for it.'  
In the case of mere lazy vagabonds who enter the cloister for 
 
                         the good bellyful, 
       The warm serge and the rope that goes all round, 
       And day-long blessed idleness beside,
                    (Browning's ^Fra Lippo Lippi~)
 
contemplation is, as in Spenser's picture, pure excuse for 
shunning work.  Dante is thinking of a somewhat higher type -- 
men who have a genuine love of goodness, but so feeble that it 
sinks into melancholy indifference even to holy things under the 
strain of a life of contemplation, to which neither God nor their 
own nature ever called them.  There is no cure for this but work, 
and work which preserves the proper balance between the outer and 
inner life, action and contemplation.  `Akedia,' writes Bishop 
Martensen, `must -- apart from dietetic means, which in many 
cases are to be applied -- be fought, above all things, by 
regular work, in which the individual can forget himself, as also 
by living together with men, by intercourse with nature, in which 
last respect Goethe so aptly says that the pleasure we find in 
life depends on the regular return to external things, on the 
alternation of day and night, the change of the seasons, of 
blossom and fruit; that the equipoise in our own existence 
depends on our living together with this quiet regularity of 
nature, on our surrender to it' (^Christian Ethics~ [Individual], p.
378).
 
At the same time, no greater mistake could be made than 
to suppose that the disappearance of the word from our vocabulary 
means the disappearance of the sin from our lives.  `It would be 
incautious,' writes Bishop Paget, `and profoundly and periliously 
untrue, if any one were to think that the temptation and the sin 
belong to a bygone age, or need not be thought about or fought 
against in the present day, even under such circumstances as may 
seem to have least of the cloister or of asceticism in them.  It 
may have changed its habit, covered its tonsure, and picked up a 
new language; but it is the same old sin which centuries ago was 
wrecking lives that had been dedicated to solitude and to 
austerity, to prayer and praise.'  The plain fact of experience 
is that it is frequently produced by action, as surely as by 
contemplation.  The warm young impulses of the soul, when they 
attempt to embody themselves in deeds, get chilled and 
discouraged by contact with the hard facts of life: faith withers 
in the breath of the world's unbelief; hope faints when it sees 
how little can be accomplished; and love shrinks back within 
itself, perhaps even dies under the wounds inflicted on it by 
gratitude and abuse.  A paralyzing sense of the uselessness of 
doing anything creeps over the heart, a great weariness in well-doing,
a hopelessness about one's self, as if the very heart-strings were
unstrung or even cut.  `And so there settles down 
upon the soul a dire form of accidie; the dull refusal of the 
highest aspiration in the moral life; the acceptance of a view of 
one's self and of one's powers which once would have appeared 
intolerably poor, unworthy, and faint-hearted; and acquiescence 
in discouragement, which reaches the utmost depth of sadness when 
it ceases to be regretful; a despondency concerning that goodness 
to which the love of God has called men, and for which His grace 
can make them strong' (^The Spirit of Discipline~, pp. 33, 46).  This
is Accidie is its nobler form.  Far lower is the form it assumes when
it is the weary reaction upon itself of a heart over-driven and jaded
with an unceasing round of the world and its excitements.  For, to
quote Martensen once more, `while weariness and disgust of life mainly
spring from an unfruitfully contemplative tendency, and a leisurely
occupation with one thing, yet it may also proceed from the contrary,
and that in the form of becoming ^blas$e~, of spiritual 
withering, namely, from living and moving exclusively in 
multiplicity, in an excess of enjoyments, as is the case with 
many people of the world, to whom religion alone, that is, the 
return of the One, would bring healing' (^Christian Ethics~
[Individual], p. 379).  The direct and intentional contrast to every
form of this sin is Matelda on the Mountain-top, the fair and radiant
symbol of the Active Life, to whom work is as the gathering of flowers,
and contemplation of God's handiwork a joy that breaks into music on
the lips (^Purg.~ XXVIII. 37ff. See {comm. to that canto}).
 
This chapter is too long already, but there is one point 
which must be noticed before closing.  It is strange to find a 
total absence of prayer on this Terrace.  No soul either prays 
for himself or asks the prayers of others.  The omission is 
certainly not accidental; but it is extremely difficult to 
account for it.  Are the penitents supposed to be praying in the 
silence and secret of the heart?  Or are we to apply to them the 
saying `laborare est orare,' as Dr. Moore suggests (^Studies in Dante~,
2nd Series, p. 262), regarding their eager running as both work and
prayer?  Or, finally, are we to regard their prayerlessness as in some
sort part of their punishment for some former abuse of prayer?  I
believe it is in this last direction we are to look for the answer. 
Prayer is perhaps the highest exercise of the human soul and requires
the greatest spiritual energy.  (`Prayer is not a substitute for work;
it is a desperate effort to work further and to be efficient beyond the
range of one's powers.  It is not the lazy who are most inclined to
prayer; those pray most who care most, and who, having worked hard,
find it intolerable to be defeated' [^The Life of Reason~: ^Reason in
Religion~, by George Santayana, p. 40].)  When a man gives way to
accidie, it is one of the first things that suffer, and that in two
ways: either it is dropped, or, if it cannot be dropped, it is degraded
to a cant.  The latter is, perhaps, what Dante was chiefly thinking of. 
His choice of an Abbot as the typical penitent shows that he had before
his mind men who professed to devote their lives to prayer.  When they
gave way to sloth, prayer in any real sense became too heavy a burden
for their spiritual 
energy.  Their profession of religion might compel them to 
continue the form of it, but it could be nothing but a form, and 
would rapidly sink into a cant.  It is the danger of every man 
whose profession compels him to handle sacred things as his 
daily business: his soul tends to become (^Raban~, by W. C. Smith, p.
119):
 
       Praying-machine, until the day's chief sin 
       Is the chief duty he has done therein.
 
The penalty is sure: prayer loses all spiritual reality for the 
man himself, and the power of true prayer withers away.  No form 
of prayer is given to these souls, for the simple reason that 
they have lost for a time the power to use it, and its total 
absence is a greater reverence to God than to continue to repeat, 
as of old, an empty form.  It is probably for the same reason 
that they ask no prayer from others, as do the souls on the rest 
of the Terraces.  It was part of their own duty on earth and 
negligently performed that it ceased to have any spiritual 
reality even to themselves, and they lost faith in their own vain 
repetitions.  This loss of faith still clings to them -- they 
cannot now ask others to pray for them, remembering the unreality 
of their own prayers for the dead.  This would give a very 
significant and impressive meaning to the absence of prayer from 
this Terrace, and one which need not be confined to monks.  The 
loss of the power of prayer, of the sense of its reality and 
worth, is the natural penalty of an habitual yielding to 
spiritual Accidie, in the wide meaning of that almost forgotten 
word. 

	|139-145.~  It was now the hour before the dawn on the Tuesday 
morning.  The troop of penitents of Sloth swept on out of sight, 
and Dante fell into a dream -- his second since he arrived upon 
the mount.  His description of how he drifted into it shows that 
it was something more than the result of mere natural weariness: 
 
          A new thought did set itself within me, 
          Whence others many and diverse were born; 
          And so from one unto another I doted on 
          That mine eyes for very wandering I closed, 
          And the musing into dream transmuted.
 
The nature of the dream proves that this is that `wandering of 
the mind around forbidden things,' which Gregory names as one of 
the six `daughters of Sloth,' and which Aquinas traces out in 
various directions and forms.  The dream in its beginning is an 
evil one; and since Dante expressly says it in the transmutation 
of his musing into a new form, it is obvious that this wandering 
of the mind is born of accidie.  He means to tell us that instead 
of keeping vigil against this sin, he slothfully allowed his mind 
to wander round forbidden things, and these forbidden things, as 
we shall see from the dream, are the sins on the three remaining 
Terraces.
