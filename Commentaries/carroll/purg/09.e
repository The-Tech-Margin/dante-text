	|Proemio.~  We have now arrived at the close of Dante's first day
on the Mountain -- Easter Sunday, which was spent in visiting the
various classes of Penitents of the Last Hour.  Although the 
Pilgrims are still in this lower division, it will be convenient 
to regard the dream with which this Ninth Canto opens as the true 
beginning and prophecy of Purgatory proper, and indeed, as we 
shall see, of the completed journey even to the fire of the 
Empyrean. 
 
	|1-12.~  The Canto begins with a note of time so obscure that a 
whole library has been written on it.  The amount of time and 
thought spent upon it is, in truth, out of all proportion to the 
importance of the question, which is the comparatively trivial 
one: when did Dante fall asleep -- at the moonrise on Sunday 
night, or the sunrise on Monday morning?  Nothing whatever in the 
moral and religious interpretation seems to hang on the answer. 
The difficulty arises chiefly from the opening words: 
 
       The concubine of old Tithonus now 
       Was whitening at the balcony of the east, 
       Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour.
 
Our first thought is naturally that the reference is to Aurora, 
the Dawn; but several things make us pause.  First of all, the 
words `concubine' and `paramour' are peculiar.  Tithonus in the 
myth was the husband of Aurora; and when a less honourable 
relation is indicated, it is very generally believed to refer to 
the Lunar Aurora, who is regarded as his mistress.  This 
interpretation seems to be supported by the constellation with 
which her brow is shining as with gems, 
 
       Set in the figure of the cold animal 
       Which with its tale doth smite the people.

(There seems to be a reference to Rev. ix. 10.)  It is difficult to
think of this as any other sign of the Zodiac than that of the
Scorpion.  The sign of the Fishes, which is sometimes suggested, is
excluded by the reference to the smiting of the tail, and by the fact
that it has no bright stars to shine like gems upon the brow.  In
addition there is the statement in ll. 7-9, that two of the steps by
which the Night climbs were past, and the third was folding its wings. 
If the `steps' are the four watches, the third would carry us on to the
time of dawn; but `the steps by which the Night ^climbs~' must refer to
the hours of its ascending to its climax of midnight.  The meaning
therefore appears to be as follows.  The Aurora of the 
Moon was beginning to look forth like a fair woman from her 
balcony about the closing of the third hour of the night, a 
little before nine o'clock.  Dante, who `had something of Adam in 
him,' namely the flesh, worn out with the long climb of the 
previous day and night, sank into sleep on the grass of the 
Flowery Valley; and at the hour of dawn he had the first of the 
three dreams by which he was warned, encouraged, and strengthened 
for the climbing of the Mountain.  (Dr. Moore in his ^Studies~ [3rd
Series, pp. 74-84] has a long and careful discussion of the passage. 
He lays down the principle `that Dante, when giving indications of time
by references to astronomical data, does so in such popular language
and terms as would be generally understood by his readers, and that he
does not take account of scientific corrections of such popular views,
whether he may have had access to them or not.'  He paraphrases the
passage thus: -- `The Aurora before moonrise was lighting up the
Eastern sky [ll. 2-3]; the brilliant stars of the constellation Scorpio
were on the horizon [ll. 4-6]; and, finally, it was shortly after 8.30
P.M. [ll. 7-9].'  We must remember, however, that though Dante fell
asleep thus early, his dream did not come till the morning [ll. 13-
21].)
 
	|13-33.~  It is worth while to pause a little to examine Dante's
view of dreams, which is substantially that of his Church.  They 
may be agents of temptation or means of grace, according to their 
source.  When, as in the case of many dreams in Scripture, they 
come from God, they are regarded as an inferior mode of 
revelation, given, as a rule, in a comparatively low state of 
spiritual knowledge.  In the words of Joel (ii. 28): `Your old 
men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions,' `it 
has been thought that dreams mark the decay, visions the flower 
of strength' (^Catholic Dictionary~, art. `Dreams').  As an inferior
means of revelation and grace, they are appropriate to Purgatory.  In
the Inferno, obviously they can have no place; and the perfect holiness
and vision of Paradise no longer need them.  Dante regards them as a
means of grace in the comparatively low moral state in which he has
lived up to this time.  On the Mountain-top Beatrice reproaches him for
resisting her inspiration when she `called him back in dream and
otherwise,' the allusion being probably to the dreams in the end of the
^Vita Nuova.~  Then when he has made with tears his final confession of
unfaithfulness to her, she tells him that the time for dreams is over: 
 
          `Speak no more as one who dreams.'

(^Purg.~ xxx. 134; xxxiii. 33; ^V.N.~ 40, 43.)
 
Dante shared in the common belief of the ancients that 
morning dreams are prophetic of the truth, and each of the three 
which he has on the Mountain occurs at dawn.  His belief in them 
is expressed in the words in which he introduces the first: 
 
       In the hour when her sad lay begins 
       The swallow, nigh unto the morning, 
       Perchance in memory of her former woes, 
       And when the mind of man a pilgrim 
       More from the flesh, and less by thoughts imprisoned, 
       Is in its visions as it were divine.

(The other dreams on the Mount are Cantos xix. 1ff., and xxvii. 94ff. 
All these begin with the words `^Nell'ora.~'  Count Ugolino's dream
[^Inf.~ xxxiii. 22ff.] was also a morning one.  Tennyson has the same
idea:

                    `on to dawn, when dreams
          Begin to feel the truth and stir of day.'

The divination of dreams is spoken of in ^Conv.~ ii. 9.)  From this it
almost appears as if Dante believed, as do many savage tribes, that the
soul issues forth from the body during sleep.  In the ^Convito~ he
says: `We behold a continual experience of our immortality in the
divinations of our dreams.'  Such a divination is the dream before us,
carrying Dante, as it does, to the fire of the highest Heaven: 
 
       In dream I seemed to see an eagle 
       Poised in the heaven, with plumes of gold, 
       With his wings open, and astrain to swoop. 
       And meseemed I was there where his friends 
       Had been by Ganymede abandoned, 
       When to the high consistory he was rapt. 
       Within myself I thought, perhaps he strikes 
       By custom only here, and perhaps from other place 
       Disdains to bear up any in his feet. 
       Then meseemed that, having wheeled a little, 
       Terrible as the lightning he descended, 
       And snatched me upward even to the fire. 
       There it seemed that he and I did burn, 
       And the imagined flame did scorch me so 
       That of necessity my sleep was broken. 
 
Starting up in dismay he grew pale as a man who freezes to find 
everything changed.  Sordello, Nino, Malaspina, were gone -- 
Virgil alone remained.  The sun was already two hours high -- so 
much of the good light wasted.  The secluded valley in which he 
had fallen asleep had given place to the open hillside where his 
face is turned to the sea.  His `Comforter' quiets his alarm.  No 
time has yet been lost.  Lucia, his patron saint, came at early 
dawn and carried him up to this `good point.'  Yonder is the 
rampart which encloses Purgatory; and that is the open entrance 
which she showed him with `her beauteous eyes.'  It only remained 
for him to `widen all his strength,' and enter in. 
 
The most difficult question here is: What is meant to be 
symbolized by the Eagle?  Botta's idea that it is `the symbol of 
genius' is absurdly wide of the mark: Dante knew perfectly that 
not his own genius, but the grace of God, could raise him to the 
fire of the highest Heaven.  It is not easy to understand how Dr. 
Oelsner arrives at his interpretation that it represents 
baptismal regeneration.  `The eagle, in the "Bestiaries,"' he 
writes, `is said to fly up in his old age into the circle of 
fire, where he burns off all his feathers and falls blinded into 
a fountain of water, whence he issues with his youth renewed. 
This is a symbol of baptismal regeneration' (^Purgatorio~ [Temple
Classics], p. 114).  What this can have to do with Dante it is hard to
see, since neither he nor the Eagle falls into a fountain of water. 
The commonest interpretation identifies Lucia with the Eagle, and
regards her as Divine grace, prevenient, illuminant, or co-operant. 
`In Lucia,' says Dr. Hettinger, `prevenient grace comes to the poet's
assistance, and enables him of his own free-will to make those acts of
faith, fear, hope, love, and repentance which predispose him for
justifying grace, and which are beyond his natural power' (^Dante's
Divina Commedia~, p. 152 [English Translation]).  Without denying such
interpretations, Butler in his most interesting note on the three
dreams, suggests that the Eagle is Contemplation -- `the emblem from
the earliest Christian times of the soul that most aspires to meditate
on divine things, and as such adopted for the special "cognisance" of
St. John the Divine (^The Purgatory of Dante~, App. A., p. 424).  There
is doubtless truth in this, but it appears to me to be stated too
vaguely and generally, instead of being evolved from the context of
Dante's feelings and situation at the moment.  The Eagle ^is~
Contemplation, but contemplation of the Empire.  Lucia ^is~ Divine
grace, but grace working through that imperial vision. 
 
The immediate context is the Valley of the Princes where 
the dream takes place.  Now, that Valley represents to Dante the 
unideal Empire.  Princes and rulers from the Emperor downwards 
had just been pointed out to him, who had neglected their high 
imperial task.  Immediately before entering it he had burst out 
into indignant rebuke of both Pope and Emperor for this criminal 
neglect.  It is almost impossible to believe after all this, that 
the Eagle of Dante's dream is grace or contemplation in general, 
and has nothing to do with the Eagle of the Empire.  We must bear 
in mind also that Dante's dreams are prophetic, or, to use 
Butler's word, `prefatory' of something to which the poet is 
about to move.  Now, he is on the point of beginning the ascent 
of the Seven Terraces which lead to the Earthly Paradise on the 
top, and this, he has told us in the ^De Monarchia~ (iii. 16), is 
the figure of the ideal Empire upon earth.  But there is also an 
ideal Empire beyond earth.  In Jupiter, the Sixth Heaven, more 
than a thousand souls of Righteous Kings in the form of bright 
starry lights form themselves into the head and neck of the 
imperial Eagle.  It is the heavenly ideal of Empire; and 
although, as he tells us, it is shown locally in the Sixth Heaven 
as an accommodation to human weakness, it is really nowhere else 
than in the Tenth Heaven, the Empyrean or Sphere of Fire (^Par.~ iv.
28-48; xviii. 52ff.).  With all this before our minds, it seems
reasonable to suppose that the Eagle with feathers of gold which
swooped down into the Valley of Negligent Princes is the heavenly and
ideal Empire to which Dante is finally to rise.  The vision of it is
given to strengthen and encourage him in this low valley: in spite of
all the neglect of their imperial duty of which these Princes had 
been guilty, an ideal heavenly Empire was forming itself, an 
Eagle with golden feathers and outspread wings, swift and 
terrible as the lightning, and powerful to lift men up even to 
the fire.  (There is a reference in Villani's ^Chronicle~ [i. 40] which
bears out this interpretation.  Speaking of the Roman standard, he says
that Augustus `changed it, and bore the golden field and the eagle
natural, to wit, in black colour, signifying the supremacy of the
Empire, for like as the eagle surpasses every other bird, and sees more
clearly than any other creature, ^and flies as high as the heaven of
the hemisphere of fire~, so the Empire ought to be above every other
temporal sovereignty.'  Doubtless Villani means the sphere of fire
between air and moon; but Dante, regarding the Empire as more than a
mere `temporal sovereignty,' raises the Eagle to the fire of the
Empyrean.  See ^Conv.~ ii. 4.)  By means of the mere vision of it in a
dream, Lucia, the prevenient grace of God, lifts the Pilgrim out of the
Valley and carries him up almost to the Gate of St. Peter.  If it be
objected that this is to give to Dante's contemplation a mere political
colour, the reply is that, in spite of his separation between the
sphere of Pope and Emperor, he did not draw our modern line of
distinction between the religious and the 
political.  Church and Empire were two sides of the one same 
Kingdom of God, and their apparent separation of spheres was only 
for the temporary purposes of a sinful earth.  Even here the 
antagonism should be minimized to the utmost; but in the Sixth 
Heaven, ruled over by the Angelic Dominations, it has no 
existence.  Dante could not have understood if he had been told 
that contemplation of the ideal Empire of eternity had in it 
nothing spiritual or religious.  It was the goal of all his 
highest, purest hopes. 
 
The great lesson he had to learn here in this Valley of 
Negligent Princes was that this ideal Empire is still far off. 
He can see it indeed `in clear dream and solemn vision'; but he 
is not yet able to enter in.  When the Eagle snatches him up to 
the fire, he is so scorched that the agony awakes him, and, 
instead of the highest Heaven, he finds himself outside the Gate 
of Purgatory, with the whole long journey and purifying 
discipline before him.  It is the idea worked out in Newman's 
^Dream of Gerontius~: the soul which, `with intemperate energy of 
love,' begs to see Christ before it is purified, is seized and 
scorched and shrivelled by His `keen sanctity,' and thereby made 
willing to undergo the Purgatorial pains.  Just so does the 
burning agony of the fire of the highest Heaven reveal to Dante 
his great need of purification and lay him in humble 
self-abasement at the Gate of Purgatory, 
 
       `Consumed, yet quickened, by the glance of God.' 
 
The whole incident is intended to show also that the 
Divine grace can penetrate far deeper than our own conscious life 
and efforts.  When the active powers are laid asleep, and the 
guidance of Reason is in abeyance, and all the ordinary means of 
grace fall away from the soul, even then God keeps the pathway 
open for the feet of His messengers.  `So He giveth His beloved 
in sleep' (Ps. cxxvii. 2).  One momentary flash of `the fire' in a
vision of the night may sometimes accomplish more for the soul than 
struggling hours of its own climbing, and outrun Reason's slower 
pace.  Virgil himself gladly yields place to Lucia, the Divine 
grace of the dream, content to follow humbly in her footprints, 
and to learn from `her beauteous eyes' the opening in the rocky 
rampart which lies between the soul and the next stage of the new 
life.  (St. Lucy's `eyes' are probably the `demonstrations' of truth
which grace carries intuitively to the Reason; and they were
`beautiful' because she had plucked them out in order to remain pure
[Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, ii. 613-619.)
 
       For God speaketh in one way, 
       Yea in two, though man regardeth it not. 
       In a dream, in a vision of the night, 
       When deep sleep falleth upon men, 
       In slumberings upon the bed; 
       Then he openeth the ears of men, 
       And sealeth their instruction, 
       That he may withdraw man from his purpose, 
       And hide pride from man; 
       He keepeth back his soul from the pit, 
       And his life from perishing by the sword.
                              (Job xxxiii. 14-18.) 
 
Yet these visionary moments are not unconnected with the waking 
life.  They never come until the soul has climbed some height in 
the struggle against sin.  Dante indicates this by confining the 
swoop of the Eagle of his dream to the place where he fell 
asleep, the Valley of the Princes: 
 
       I thought within myself, perhaps he strikes 
       From habit only here, and from other place 
       Haply disdains to bear up any in his feet. 
 
`Only here' refers, as the context plainly shows, to Mount Ida in 
Mysia, from which Ganymede was `caught up to the high 
consistory,' and where Dante imagined himself to be in his dream. 
Now, the mere mention of Ganymede is the poet's way of connecting 
his dream with the Empire.  Rome was through AEneas the direct 
descendant of Troy; and it was from Tros, the father of Ganymede, 
that Troy derived its name.  The allusion therefore carries us 
back to the very source of the Empire, from which alone the Eagle 
deigns to bear up any in its feet.  Translating all this into its 
moral equivalent, the meaning seems to be that the soul must 
first climb up to this Valley of the Princes where the sin of 
neglect of duty to the Empire is borne in upon the conscience; 
this, in its turn, carries the mind back to the origin of the 
Empire and its Divine election and purpose; and from this the 
soul is caught up in dream and vision to the celestial ideal of 
Empire, too fiery-bright for the sinful spirit yet to bear.  
`Only here' and from no other place, can the vision be given. 

	|70-72.~  The Pilgrims are now on the very borders of Purgatory 
proper, and Dante quickens the reader's attention by a note in 
which he points the heightening of his theme: 
 
       Reader, thou seest well how I exalt 
       My matter, and therefore marvel not 
       If with greater art I prop it up.
 
The higher theme is the passing from the lower slopes where the 
will is half-paralyzed by old habits of evil, to the Terraces 
above on which the penitent soul faces its purifying discipline. 
The `greater art' with which this higher theme is supported, is 
probably the wealth of symbolism which fills the following 
Cantos.  Nothing, indeed, can surpass the art with which every 
Terrace is surveyed, measured, and mapped out, and every detail 
of the symbolism set in its appointed place in the routine of 
penitential discipline through which the soul must now pass. 
 
	|73-78.~  From the point where Dante awoke, the opening which
Lucia had pointed out in the rampart above seemed a mere crevice in the
wall; but when they climbed nearer, it turned out to be a gate, 
with three steps of diverse colours leading up to it, and a 
silent Warder guarding it. `The allegorical signification,' says 
Vernon, `is that he who looks at repentance from afar, thinks the 
entrance much narrower and more difficult than when he has 
mastered his will, and really turned himself to it' (^Readings on the
Purgatorio~, i. 341).  But it is just as easy to read into it the
opposite meaning.  At a distance the difficulties of repentance are not
realized; it is only when you come near that you find yourself
confronted by a closed gate and a stern, inexorable Warder. 
 
This Gate stands in strong and intentional contrast to 
that of Hell.  The latter was wide, while this is narrow; it 
stood open, not closed and double-locked like this; and no Porter 
confronted the traveller (^Inf.~ v. 20; viii. 126).  The meaning is
obvious.  `Facilis descensus Averno' -- nothing is easier than to sin;
but when the sinner seeks to lift his feet out of the pit, he finds the
very gate of mercy locked in his face, not to be opened save on fixed
inexorable conditions which satisfy its stern Guardian. 

	|79-116.~  This Guardian, who is in the form of an Angel, has many
meanings.  It is from St. Peter he holds the keys of the Gate, 
and therefore he represents the power of the Church to bind and 
loose in Heaven.  At the same time, he represents the human 
priest-confessor, for the possibility of error of judgment which 
Peter attributes to him, could scarcely apply to the literal 
Angel (^Purg.~ ix. 127-129).  From this point of view, Dante wishes to
draw a picture of the ideal confessor of sinful souls.  From another
point of view, he is the image of the penitent sinner's own 
conscience, half-blinded with the face and sword of Divine 
justice; in the same way as the hideous demon Minos, who acts as 
confessor in the Inferno, is the symbol of the distorted and 
horrible conception of justice which is one of the principal 
tortures of the despairing impenitent conscience of the lost (^Inf.~ v.
4-15).  The Angel was sitting on the threshold, and the threshold was
of adamant.  `The old commentators,' says Vernon, `all interpreted
^diamante~ to symbolize the firmness and constancy of the confessor;
but the more modern see in it the image of the solid 
foundation on which the Church rests' -- in accordance with the 
words: `On this rock will I build my church' (^Readings in the
Purgatorio~, i. 345n.).  The probability is that Dante meant both.  The
attitude of the Angel is certainly symbolic.  He sits on the adamantine
threshold of the Church as partaking of its stern, inflexible justice;
but Dante is careful to tell us that his feet rest on the topmost step,
and that too must have its own symbolism.  It is the step of blood-red
porphyry, the deepest meaning of which is Love that pours itself out
`like blood that gushes from a vein.'  The ideal confessor is one in
whom are united the inflexibility of Divine Justice and the tenderness
of Divine Love.  This Love is shown in Peter's command to him to err,
if he err at all, upon the side of mercy. 
 
His robe is also significant in its symbolic colour: 
 
       Ashes, or earth when it is dug out dry, 
       Would be of one colour with his vestment. 
 
The exact colour of which Dante was thinking, Ruskin declares, is 
a whitish grey: `Ashes necessarily mean ^wood~-ashes in an 
Italian mind, so that we get the tone very pale; and there can be 
no doubt whatever about the hue meant, because it is constantly 
seen on the sunny sides of the Italian hills, produced by the 
scorching of the ground, a dusty and lifeless whitish grey, 
utterly painful and oppresive' (^Modern Painters~, iii. Pt. iv. ch. xv.
7).  Whatever the literal colour, the symbolic signifies penitence, as
the mention of ashes shows.  It is, indeed, difficult to think that
Dante has not the ceremonies of Ash Wednesday before his mind.  On this
the first day of Lent, public penitents had to appear in penitential
garb before the church door, just as Dante is doing here before the
Gate of Purgatory.  The endings, however, are different.  After the
bishop had sprinkled ashes on the heads of the penitents, he solemnly
excluded them from the church, whereas Dante is admitted by the Angel. 
(This is the rite in its ancient form.  In the present day, the ashes
are sprinkled on the whole congregation [Smith and Cheetham's
^Dictionary of Christian Antiquities~, `Lent'].  Another symbolism,
however, seems to be hinted at.  As we saw, the Angel represents the
ideal priest-confessor, and no priest can be this who does not himself
wear the garb of penitence.  Dante says pointedly that it is from under
his ashen robe the confessor draws the two keys; in other words, no man
who himself has not passed through the great experience of repentance
is either worthy or able to use the golden key of Heaven's authority or
the silver key of knowledge of how to deal with penitent souls.  It is
under this robe he wears the keys, and from beneath it he must draw
them forth for use.  No one acquainted with the workings of Dante's
mind will think this too subtle a piece of interpretation.  He was not
prepared to admit the fitness of every priest-confessor; no man whose
own soul was not clothed in the garb of penitence had or could have the
keys of the new life. 
 
The sword in the Angel's hand is variously interpreted as 
the righteous judgment of God, or the authority of the priest to 
bind and loose, or `the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of 
God.'  This last view seems to cover the widest meaning.  Dante 
may have had in mind the words of Scripture: `The word of God is 
quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of 
the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and 
intents of the heart.  Neither is there any creature that is not 
manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened unto 
the eyes of him with whom we have to do' (Heb. iv. 12, 13).  It is
obvious how appropriate these words are here.  This piercing,
revealing, discerning power of the word of God is the absolutely 
indispensable weapon of the true ideal confessor.  Dante cannot 
look steadfastly at its shining blade or at the face of him who 
wields it: the Divine word too plainly condemns his evil life, 
and when the point of the sword is applied, the hidden `wounds' 
of sin grow suddenly visible upon his brow.  (Comp. xxix. 139-141,
where Dante fears the sword which St. Paul carries.) 
 
As the two Pilgrims draw near, the Angel speaks no word 
at first, perhaps to indicate that confession cannot be thrust on 
any soul: if it is to be genuine, it must spring from its own 
spontaneous desire.  Nevertheless it is he who first breaks the 
silence, evidently because there was something unusual in the 
approach of the strangers.  He stops them somewhat sternly: 
 
       `Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?' 
       Began he to exclaim: `Where is the escort? 
       Take heed the coming upward harm you not.' 
 
Scartazzini thinks the question of escort indicates nothing more 
than that the Angel saw they were not souls for Purgatory; but is 
is difficult to accept this.  For one thing, they ^are~ souls for 
Purgatory -- at least one is, for Dante makes his confession and 
is admitted.  For another, the words `^the~ escort' plainly imply 
the well-known and customary escort, probably an Angel, as may 
writers think.  `An Angel conducts the spirits from the mouth of 
the Tiber to the shore of Purgatory, and we must therefore by 
analogy suppose that another Angel conducts them from the shore 
up to the gate.  The Poets have come up to the gate in an unusual 
manner, as before this they had in an unusual manner reached the 
shore of the Holy Mountain.  Consequently the guardians of these 
two places, Cato of the one, and the Angel of the other, put to 
them the same question' (Vernon's ^Readings in the Purgatorio~, i.
342n.).  Whoever the escort may have been, the really important point
is that Dante is not rejected merely because his repentance is not
according to rule.  When Virgil replies that a Heavenly Lady had
directed them to the Gate, the Angel at once gives them hearty welcome:
it is the mark of the ideal confessor that he recognizes the signs of
grace in a true penitent even when he approaches him without the
customary escort of the ordinary means and rules.  His one anxiety is
that he do not come in a spirit which will injure the soul, for an
unreal repentance is more harmful than none. 
 
	|94-102.~  At the invitation of the Angel-Confessor, Dante drew
near to the three steps which led up to the threshold of adamant. 
`Each stair mysteriously was meant,' as Milton says of the gate 
of Heaven (^Par. Lost~, iii. 516): 
 
       There where we came, unto the first step, 
       White marble was so polished and so smooth 
       That I mirrored me therein such as I appear. 
       The second, tinct of a deeper hue than perse, 
       Was of a rock rugged and fire-scorched, 
       Cracked through its length and through its breadth. 
       The third, which above doth mass itself 
       Porphyry seemed to me as flaming red 
       As blood which from a vein is gushing forth.

(^Summa~, iii. q. xc, a. 2, 3.  See Chaucer's ^Parson's Tale~: `Now
shaltow understande what is bihovely [profitable] and necessarie to
verray perfit penitence.  And this stant on thre thynges: Contricioun
of herte, Confessioun of mouth, and Satisfaccioun.'  The fourth element
of Penance is Absolution, which Dante does not receive till he has made
Satisfaction, and thereby proved the sincerity of his repentance.  For
the change in the thirteenth century by which Absolution came
immediately after Confession, and the consequent degradation of the
idea of Satisfaction, see {comm. to ^Purg.~ 2.91-102}.)  These three
steps represent three of the four elements of the Sacrament of Penance:
Confession, Contrition, and Satisfaction, and, I think, in this order. 
It is true that Aquinas reverses the order of the first two: `contritio
cordis, et confessio oris, et satisfactio operis.'  It must be
acknowledged too that this is the natural and psychological order, for
the contrition of the heart must precede confession of the mouth in
actual experience.  Nevertheless the order given above seems to be that
which was in Dante's mind.  It is not their psychological order he is
thinking of, but that in which his penitence would be revealed in the 
Sacrament of Penance.  First would come the confession of the 
lips; this would lay bare the broken and contrite heart, of which 
the second step is the obvious symbol; and out of this would 
issue the satisfaction of good works.  In short, Aquinas is 
stating the doctrine as a theologian, Dante as a penitent in the 
act of submitting himself to the discipline of the Church.  Miss 
Rossetti's interpretation is as true as it is fervent: `The 
triple stair stands revealed as candid Confession mirroring the 
whole man, mournful Contrition breaking the hard heart of the 
gazer on the Cross, Love all aflame offering up in Satisfaction 
the life-blood of body, soul, and spirit' (^Shadow of Dante~, p. 112. 
She adds: `the adamantine threshold-seat as the priceless Merits of
Christ the Door, Christ the Rock, Christ the sure Foundation and the
precious Corner-Stone').  A closer examination will confirm this view. 
 
1.  The step of Confession.  (Aquinas insists on the necessity of
Confession: even the prelates of the Church cannot dispense a sinner
from the obligation, for that would be to `frustrate the keys': `For
sinners after Baptism, there can be no salvation unless they submit
themselves to the keys of the Church either by actual Confession and
undergoing of the judgment of the ministers of the Church, or at least
by purposing so to do with a purpose to be fulfilled in seasonable
time' [^Contra Gentiles~, iv. 72].  Father Rickaby's explanatory note
to this passage in his translation is interesting: `The sinner who will
not confess is guilty of a sort of contempt of court, despising the
summons of his Judge and the name of his Saviour.')  Before confession
can be made a man must examine himself, and therefore must have a
mirror in which he can see himself as he actually is.  If he wilfully
keeps back one mortal sin, the whole confession is invalidated.  Dante
therefore represents himself as gazing into the white, polished, marble
mirror of his awakened conscience, and what he sees there forms the
matter of his confession before God.  The whiteness represents two
things -- first, the candidness of the confession in the original
meaning of that word, its absolute sincerity; and second, it purity. 
To recall old sins is often dangerous: they may only too easily stain
the imagination and 
life afresh.  But when they are recalled in sincere penitence 
that they may be confessed and parted with, the foul images leave 
no stain on the white mirror of the conscience. 
 
2.  The step of Contrition.  This represents what Dante 
saw in the mirror, and the result of the vision.  It is his own 
heart, and it is a heart of stone, and blacker than perse (`Perse is a
colour mingled of purple and of black, but the black predominates, and
it is called after it' [^Conv.~ iv. 20].  It is the colour of the
Fountain of Wrath in ^Inf.~ vii. 103.  Some derive it from the Latin
^persicum~, a peach; others from ^Persia~, as indigo from ^Indicus~,
Indian.  In the Prologue to the ^Canterbury Tales~ [l. 617], the Reve
is clad in `a long surcote of ^pers~').  But it is now `broken and
contrite,' and scorched with the consuming fire of penitence which
burns up sin.  The breaking is complete and thorough: the stone, as
Hettinger says, `is split crosswise, both in length and breadth, to
show that the whole inward man must be broken up and all sin repented
of' (^Dante's Divina Commedia~, 327n.  {Hettinger} derives ^crepata~,
cracked, of line 99, from `crepacuore, a pang that breaks the heart'). 
The breakage in the form of the Cross can scarcely mean less than that
what broke Dante's heart with contrition was the crucifixion of Christ. 
Or to put it in the theological formula of his Church, his repentance
was ^contrition~, not ^attrition.~   Attrition is a lower form of
repentance: genuine, indeed, inasmuch as it involves a true sorrow for
sin and a true purpose of amendment; but inferior as springing from
some motive lower than the highest, the love and goodness of God, such
as the fear of punishment or the 
shamefulness of sin.  On the other hand, Contrition is `that 
sorrow for sin which arises from consideration of God's goodness 
which sin has outraged.'  Now God's goodness is most impressively 
seen in the cross of Christ, and when Dante's heart is broken in 
the form of that cross, it cannot mean less than that his sorrow for 
sin is a high and genuine contrition, which springs from no 
inferior motive of fear or interest, but from contemplation of 
the atoning love of God in Christ.  (In ^Summa~, iii. Suppl. q. i, a.
1, Aquinas takes ^Contritio~ in its etymological sense of grinding to
powder, to bring out the completeness of the penitent's break with sin. 
^Attrition~ is discussed in art. 3 of the same ^Quaestio.~) 
 
3.  The step of Satisfaction.  According to the doctrine 
of the Church, Satisfaction is the payment of the temporal 
penalty due to sin after the eternal penalty has been remitted by 
God.  The payment is made by means of good works which are also 
penal; and it is called a satisfaction because it atones for the 
injury done to God, as well as serves for the reformation of the 
sinner (`Dan. iv. 24 [so Heb. lxx and Vulg., "Authorised," iv. 27] is
the classical passage for the doctrine that man has the power of making
satisfaction for sin by good works.  "Therefore, O king, let my counsel
please thee, and redeem thy sins by justice, and thy perversities by
showing kindness to the poor."'  For the change of `break off' [A.V.]
to `redeem,' see the reasons stated in the note to this passage, ^Cath.
Dict.~ `Penance,' p. 701).  Dr. Moore in his informing study on `Dante
as a Religious Teacher,' points out that in this third step the poet
virtually substitutes Love for the Church doctrine of Satisfaction. 
Not that he denied it, especially when understood as the working out of
the temporal penal consequences of sin; but simply that Love threw this
penal satisfaction into the 
background.  `Surely Dante not without purpose substituted "Love" 
for "Satisfaction" as the third step, not indeed denying the 
latter, but bringing into prominence the fact that -- 
 
               foco d'amor ^compia~ in un punto 
       Ci@o che dee satisfar chi qui s'astalla: 
                         (^Purg.~ vi. 38, 39) 
 
and also that "sins which were many were forgiven to one that 
^loved much~" (Luke vii. 47).  In other words, he associates 
"Satisfaction" more with the inward condition of heart than with 
outward acts' (Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 47.  The
translation of the couplet quoted is given on p. 81).  All this is
symbolized by the porphyry 
 
                         as flaming red 
       As blood which from a vein is gushing forth. 
  
It is, in Miss Rossetti's words already quoted, `Love all aflame 
offering up in Satisfaction the life-blood of body, soul, and 
spirit.'  To say, as some do, that the reference is to the bloody 
scourgings of great penitents is to degrade the subject to that 
`severity to the body' which St. Paul declares to be `not of any 
value against the indulgence of the flesh' (Col. ii. 23.  The Church
denies that this satisfaction by the penitent is any disparagement of
that made by Christ.  `Neither is this satisfaction,' says the Council
of Trent, `which we discharge for our sins so our own as not to be
through Jesus Christ.  For we who can do nothing of ourselves as of
ourselves, can do all things with the co-operation of Him Who
strengtheneth us.  Thus man hath not wherein to glory, but all our
glorying is in Christ; in Whom we live; in Whom we merit; in Whom we
satisfy').
 
Before passing on, one cannot help wondering whether it 
is by accident that, while the lowest and highest steps are of 
noble and costly stones, marble and porphyry, that between them 
is a mere common rugged rock to which Dante does not think it 
worth while to give a name.  When we remember that the common 
nameless rock is symbolic of his own heart, one is tempted to 
suppose that it was chosen in humility and self-abasement; 
whereas the noble stones represent noble things -- the white 
marble, the clear mirror of conscience; and the blood-red 
porphyry, the royal law of Love. 
 
	|106-114.~  We come now to the climbing of the stairs, which is 
accomplished by Virgil drawing his companion up `with good will.'  
Allegorically this means that it is the dictate of Reason to submit 
to the Sacrament of Penance in its three parts, Confession, 
Contrition, and Satisfaction.  On the highest step Dante smote 
himself thrice upon the breast in token of the threefold sin of 
thought, word, and deed (this is sometimes referred to the three steps. 
Dante may have been thinking of St. Bernard's three conditions of
perfect confession: humility, simplicity, faith [^Cantica Canticorum~,
Serm. xvi); and then, casting himself devoutly at the `holy feet' he
begged the Angel to have mercy upon him and 
open the Gate.  Whereupon the Confessor with his sword inscribed 
seven P's on Dante's brow, commanding him to wash away the 
`wounds' when he is within.  The seven P's are the Seven Deadly 
Sins (^peccata~), one of which is to be purged away on each of 
the Seven Terraces inside the Gate.  The moral idea is that these 
sins, hitherto carefully concealed, are now in confession written 
openly upon the forehead by Him who `sets our secret sins in the 
light of His countenance'; and the instrument by which the 
revelation is made is that word of God which is sharper than any 
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul 
and spirit, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the 
heart. 
 
	|117-129.~  The passage about the keys is important enought to be
quoted: 
 
       And from beneath this he drew forth two keys. 
       The one was of gold, and the other was of silver; 
       First with the white, and after with the yellow, 
       He did so to the gate I was satisfied. 
       `Whensoever one of these keys faileth, 
       So that it turns not rightly in the lock,' 
       Said he to us, `this passage doth not open. 
       More precious is the one, but the other needs 
       Exceeding art and wit ere it unlocks, 
       For it is that which doth the knot unloose. 
       From Peter I hold them; and he said to me to err 
       Rather in opening, than in keeping locked, 
       If only the people at my feet fall down.'

(There is a kind of play upon the word ^ingegno~ in line 125.  It
means, as translated, `wit,' -- the wisdom necessary in one who is to
weigh sins and assign satisfactions for them.  But also `^ingegno della
chiave~' means the key-bit -- the part which enters the lock and acts
on the tumblers and bolts by truly weighing the sins and assigning the
proper discipline of penance.  What that is in Dante's opinion, the
Seven Terraces show us.)  St. Thomas Aquinas discusses the question of
the number of the keys and decides in favour of two, `one of which
pertains to judgment as to the fitness of him who is to be absolved,
and the other to the absolution itself' (^Summa~, iii. Suppl. q. xvii,
a. 2).  This latter is the golden key of Dante, the power to bind and
loose, the gold representing the infinite preciousness of the blood and
merits of Christ, in virtue of which alone authority to absolve is
given to the Church.  The silver key, though less precious, as the
inferior metal implies, is that which demands the greater art and
wisdom.  It is the key of knowledge of the fitness of the penitent, the
genuineness of his repentance, the comparative guilt of his sins, and
the amount and quality of the penitential discipline necessary to
render satisfaction for the injury done to God.  All this is what Dante
means when he says the silver requires `art and wit' because it
`unlooses the knot' -- the snare and entanglement in which sin has
knotted up the conscience and life.   The priest `has to decide
according to the principles of an elaborate casuistry which he has
studied for years, and in which he has been examined by his superiors,
before he enters the confessional' (^Cath. Dict.~ p. 702).  In the
natural order of things, this silver key of science must be used before
the golden key of authority; and unless both turn in the lock the gate
remains closed, the absolution is not valid.  In the ^Inferno~ Dante
gives a striking example of the fatal results of using one key only. 
Pope Boniface VIII., in virtue of his office, held the golden key of 
authority, and used it to promise pardon by anticipation for the 
sin he was persuading Count Guido of Montefeltro to commit.  Had 
he used the silver key of science, he would have known, as the 
demon puts it who seized the Count's soul at death, that 
 
         `Who repents not cannot be absolved, 
       Nor can one repent and will at once, 
       Because of the contradiction which consents not.'
                              (^Inf.~ xxvii. 118-120.) 
 
In plain words, absolution has no validity unless it is based on 
the moral and spiritual facts of the case. 
 
On the other hand, Dante did not believe that a man could, 
as it were, administer absolution to himself.  In ^Par.~ v. 
55-57, discussing the commutation of Vows, he expressly warns 
against the attempt: 
 
       `But let not any shift the burden on his shoulder 
       At his own judgment, without the turning 
       Both of the white key and of the yellow.' 
 
From the Church's point of view the reason is obvious.  No man is 
a good judge in his own case -- his conscience is an interested 
party.  `The sacrament [of Penance] is by its very nature similar 
to a criminal trial: the penitent is at once accuser, defendant, 
and witness; while the priest is the judge.  When the penitent 
has declared himself to be guilty, and appeals for mercy on the 
ground of repentance, it is for the priest to decide whether the 
case is one for forgiveness or retention of the crime, and also 
to determine the satisfaction to be made in case of 
absolution' (^A Manual of Catholic Theology~, by Wilhelm and Scannell,
ii. 471).  For this, knowledge and authority are both 
necessary, the silver key and the golden. 
 
St. Peter's instructions to the Confessor are that he 
err, if he err at all, upon the side of mercy, if only the 
sinners prostrate themselves at his feet.  It is possible that 
there is a reference to the third class of penitents in the 
Primitive Church known as the `prostrate' or `kneelers' (see note {to
comm. on ^Purg.~ 6.26-27}); but the moral idea is that the Gate is to
be opened to any one who bears the marks of genuine humility and
self-abasement for sin.  `The possibility of error in the angel,' as
Plumptre says, `rises from the fact that he is thought of, no, so to
speak, in his angelic nature, but as the representative of the priestly
confessor.'

	|130-132.~  When he opens the Gate, he tells them that he who 
looks back must return outside, the allusion being to many solemn 
warnings of Scripture against the backward look.  True penitence 
is a complete and final break with the past; and `no man, having 
put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the 
kingdom of God' (Luke ix. 62; Heb. vi. 4-6, etc.).  The warning, of
course, cannot be addressed to souls in Purgatory, since there is no
doubt of the genuineness of their repentance, and their state of grace
is secure: Dante is really thinking of himself and of souls still
subject to the imperfect and delusive repentances of this earthly life.

 
	|133-145.~  When `the holy gate' swung upon its hinges, Dante
tells us that it roared more shrilly than the gates of the public
treasury of Rome on the Tarpeian hill when `the good Metellus' vainly
endeavoured to defend it from Caesar (Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, iii. 153-
157, 167, 168).  He explains this harsh grating sound by the statement
that `the evil love of souls disuses' the door; in other words,
penitents are so few that the Gate is seldom opened, and the hinges
grow rusty and shrill: `strait is the gate, and narrow is the way,
which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.'  It is
probably for the same reason that when, in a little, he reaches the
First Terrace, he finds it, far as his eye could see, to right and
left, `more solitary than roads through deserts' (Matt. vii. 14;
^Purg.~ x. 21). 
 
At `the first thunder' of the disused hinges (some take `al primo
tuono' to mean `to the first tone' of the music within it, but wrongly. 
Dante is yet outside the Gate.  At the first grating sound of the
hinges he turned intently to it.  As it opened there came through to
him the sound of sweet music), he turned silenty toward it, and through
the opening Gate heard a burst of sweetest music, as when one listens
at a cathedral door, `when people singing with the organ stand.' 
Sometimes he catches the words, and sometimes they are lost in the
organ-music, but he recognizes that the hymn is the ^Te Deum laudamus.~ 
This hymn had a peculiar appropriateness according to the tradition
that it was composed by St. Ambrose on the occasion of St. Augustine's
conversion.  St. Augustine's own words about the power which the music
he heard in the Church at Milan had over him, may have been in the
poet's mind: `O how I wept in Thy hymns and canticles, deeply touched
by the voices of Thy Church, sweetly resounding!  Those voices flowed
into my ears, and the truth distilled into my heart, and thence the
affection of my devotion broke forth, and tears ran down, and happy was
I therein' (^Confessions~, ix. 6).  Dante does not say who were the
singers.  We naturally think of the Angels, in fulfilment of the saying
that `there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth.'  But it is possible that the singers are the souls
upon the Mountain chanting the ^Te Deum~ in joy that a sinner has begun
his purgatorial discipline, just as afterwards we find them singing the
^Gloria in excelsis~ when a penitent has fulfilled it, and is ready to
ascend to Paradise (^Purg.~ xx. 136).  It is obvious that the music
here stands in intentional contrast to the song of Casella down on the
shore: the one is a hindrance to the cleansing of the soul; the other
draws the penitent joyfully through the open door, eager to begin his
purifying pain (^Purg.~ i. 106-133.  The contrast to the Inferno [iii.
103-105] is more obvious.  Here there ascends praise to God for
salvation; there He is cursed by the lost as the author of their
misery).  The period of what Aquinas calls `deliberation' is over, the
detention due to the semi-paralysis of the will through evil habit
(^Summa~, i-ii. q. cxiii, a. 7); and `the poets cross the boundary-line
which separates regret from repentance, aspiration from energy, mere
desire from consecrated resolve.'  Dante hears the clanging of the gate
as it closes behind him, but there is no turning back; his repentance
is not to be repented of, and he sets himself resolutely to the
purifying of his soul, a task at once of joy and pain.
