	|1-18.~  All that meets his sight as he emerges is the setting sun
breaking through the smoke, as when a mist clears among the Alps.   The
reason seems to be that his anger is not yet held in by the 
curb of fear, he has not yet seen the visions of unholy wrath 
which constitute the `bridle' of this passion.  Once more as at 
the beginning of this Terrace his imagination throws him into a 
trance so deep that the sounding of a thousand trumpets would 
have passed unheard, -- a figure of the way in which the passion 
of unholy anger snatches the soul away from the sense of the 
world of external realities, and wraps it in its own insane 
dreams and delusions.  In Dante's case, however, they are not 
insanities; he is walking side by side with Virgil who is Reason, 
and his imagination is moved by `a light which in the heaven 
takes form.'  (Note that the examples of Anger are shown only when
Dante has come out into the light: not until we have escaped from the
fume and smoke of this passion are we able to see clearly the ruin it
works.)
 
	|19-24.~  The first vision of the `bridle' comes from heathen 
story, and shows the wild and awful `impiety' into which the 
frenzy of anger sweeps the soul.  `Impiety' here does not mean 
wickedness in general, but the violation of the natural bonds of 
blood and kinship which knit families together.  The story is 
that of the hideous revenge taken by Procne, daughter of 
Pandion, King of Athens, upon her husband Tereus for his cruel 
outrage on her sister Philomela.  All the natural feelings of 
motherhood swept away by her fury, she slew her son Itys, and 
served him up to his father at a feast.  When Tereus, learning 
this, pursued the sisters to slay them, the three were changed by 
the gods into birds -- Tereus into a hoopoe or hawk, Philomela 
into a swallow, and Procne into a nightingale, `the bird that 
most delights in singing.'  The `impiety' which Dante saw in 
vision was probably the murder of Itys and the eating of his 
flesh by his father, an awful example of the way in which the 
fury of anger outrages and violates the most sacred affections of 
the human heart (the story is told by Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 412-676).
 
	|25-33.~  Nevertheless, though Procne's `wild justice of revenge'
drove her to excess, she had at least the excuse of the most cruel
provocation.  The second example seems chosen because the 
provocation was out of all proportion to the revenge contemplated.  
The vision of it `rained' down from heaven, Dante says, probably to
indicate that it is taken from Scripture.  He sees Haman on a cross,
scornful and fierce in the very article of death, while round him stand
Ahasuerus, Esther, and `the just Mordecai.'  The point here is the
trifling nature of the offence and the sweeping scope of the vengeance
planned.  Mordecai's refusal to bow down to the king's favourite was an
insult which could not be wiped out with the blood of one man.  Haman
`thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone' (Esther iii. 6): the
whole Jewish race in Persia must die.  Dante compares the vanishing of
the vision from his imagination to the breaking of a bubble `of itself'
`when the water it was made of fails' -- a fine image of the way in
which Haman's revenge, overblown by his angry pride, burst like a
bubble of itself.  His vengeance overreached itself and recoiled on his
own head: `So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai' (Esther vii. 10; Dante's `crucified' [l. 26] is explained by
the word ^crux~ in the Vulgate of Esther v. 14, where the A. V. has
`gallows': `jussit excelsam parari crucem'). 
 
	|34-39.~  Procne's anger was that of outraged love; Haman's of 
overblown pride.  The third vision shows the disastrous effects 
of anger against Heaven's decree.  Dante see Lavinia weeping 
bitterly, and reproaching her mother Amata for having rashly and 
impatiently taken away her own life.  The story is taken from 
Virgil.  Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, King of Latium, and Amata, 
was first betrothed to Turnus, King of the Rutulians, but 
afterwards given in marriage to AEneas, against her mother's 
will.  War followed between the two heroes, in the course of 
which a false rumour that Turnus was slain threw Amata into such 
a frenzy of grief that she straightway hanged herself, without 
waiting for confirmation of the report.  At first sight, it seems 
as if this was nothing more than the anger of hastiness, and 
impatience; but Dante's thought goes deeper.  In his famous 
Letter to Henry VII., he compares Florence to Amata.  As the 
Latian queen rejected the marriage of her daughter with AEneas 
decreed by Heaven, so did Florence resist the ordinance of God in 
her impious refusal to receive Henry as her lawful king.  Dante 
warns her that she is simply bringing on herself the same fate of 
suicide: `the infuriated woman doth but await the halter 
wherewith to noose herself.'  In short, AEneas was to Dante, as 
to Virgil, the Heaven-ordained founder of Rome, and Lavinia the 
wife decreed to him `from Italy, the noblest region of Europe,' 
to be `the mother of Albans and Romans alike.'  As Procne was 
guilty of impiety against man, so Amata, in opposing this 
marriage, necessary for the fulfilment of Heaven's purpose of 
founding Rome to be the head and home of both Church and Empire, 
was guilty of an impiety against God, which was punished by a 
suicidal frenzy of anger.  It was, in Dante's regard, a crime 
against the Roman race parallel to that of Haman against the 
chosen people of God (^Aen.~ xii. 593-613; for the comparison of
Florence to Amata, see ^Epis.~ vii. 7; and for Lavinia as the noblest
of the three wives of AEneas, ^De Mon.~ ii. 3).
 
	|40-60.~  `Purified by pity and fear,' by these tragedies, to use
Aristotle's famous phrase (not in the Aristotelian sense, however.  In
the ^Poetics~, ^katharsis~ is a medical metaphor.  As the body by
medicine is relieved of unwholesome elements, so tragedy `purifies' the
mind by affording an outlet and discharge of the natural feelings of
pity and fear), Dante is now somewhat prepared to meet the shining
Angel of Meekness.  The brillance of his face 
wakes him from his visions of Anger, as sleep is broken by a 
sudden light.  But even yet his eyes cannot bear him, he 
outshines the sun and is `dark with excess of light.'  His voice 
as he says, `Here is the passage up,' is of such compelling 
sweetness and love that Dante resolves never to rest until he is 
worthy to see the gentle Angel.  Virgil points out that he gave 
his guidance before ever he was asked for it: 
 
       `This is a spirit divine, who in the way 
       Of going up directs us without prayer, 
       And with his own light himself conceals himself. 
       He does with us as a man does with himself; 
       For he who awaits the prayer, and sees the need, 
       Malignly leans already towards refusal.'
 
Plumptre thinks he sees in this `some personal experience of 
disappointment, when Dante had hoped for help from one who saw 
his need, but waited to be asked and was then refused.  It jarred 
on Dante's sensitiveness that he was compelled to solicit the 
cold hand of charity, and to solicit it in vain.'  Doubtless that 
is true, but Dante is thinking chiefly of a characteristic of 
that Meekness which the Angel represents.  Anger is not `gentle 
and easy to be entreated,' it often hardens its heart against 
every appeal for help.  On the other hand, as a passage in the 
^Convito~ says, true liberality anticipates the asking; `because 
when a thing is asked for, then the transaction is, on one side, 
not a matter of virtue but of commerce, inasmuch as he who 
receives buys, though he who gives sells not; wherefore Seneca 
saith "that nothing is bought more dear than that on which 
prayers are spent."  Wherefore in order that there may be zealous 
liberty in the gift, and that it may be noted therein, it behoves 
that it be clear of every feature of merchandize; and so the gift 
must be unasked.'  Hence it is that the Virgin Mary represents 
the prevenient grace of God which anticipates our prayers (^Conv.~ i.
8 [Wicksteed].  Boccaccio in his ^Life of Dante~ tells how Guido
Novello da Polenta of Ravenna, in order to save the poet the shame of
asking hospitality offered it freely, ` requesting from Dante of
special grace that which he knew Dante must needs have begged of him'):

 
       `Not only the benignity gives succour 
       To him who asketh it, but oftentimes 
       Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.'
                              (^Par.~ XXXIII. 16-18.)

	|64-69.~  The way in which the Angel conceals himself in his own
light is in contrast to that in which the Angry conceal themselves in
their own darkness.  For Anger is a dark passion concealing its 
plans and purposes of revenge, whereas Meekness is a bright and 
sunny virtue harbouring nothing but on eagerness to help others, 
so vivid that it anticipates the need it sees.  If it seems dark, 
it is partly because it conceals its help in humility, and partly 
because the eye, not yet wholly purified of angry passions, 
cannot bear its glowing, generous light. 
 
The sun is now almost at the setting and Virgil urges 
haste lest the night fall, when, according to the law of the 
Mount, no man can climb.  The evening hour, however, has a 
special appropriateness to this Terrace.  Dante has timed himself 
so carefully that his departure is the fulfilment of the command, 
`Be ye angry, and sin not: ^let not the sun go down upon your 
wrath~' (Eph. iv. 26).  As soon as he had reached the first step of the
stairway up, the third P was gently blown from his brow: 
 
       Near me I felt as it were the movement of a wing, 
       And fanning in the face, and saying `BEATI 
       PACIFICI, who are free from evil wrath.'
 
The waft of the Angel's wing is soft and gentle as the evening 
breeze, cooling the brow, and blowing away the hot and angry 
passions of the day.  The Beatitude of the Peacemakers cannot 
fall like evening dew, so long as any `evil wrath' is harboured 
in the hearth.  For Dante knows that there is a wrath which is 
not evil, and that to be incapable of righteous indignation 
against sin is not a virtue but a vice.  Probably the stern 
denunciations of the Papacy in this Terrace and throughout the 
poem are examples of this righteous anger.  The waft of the 
Angel's wing, which blew away all passions of private personal 
revenge, could only fan into clearer flame the fire of righteous 
indignation which burnt in Dante's soul when he saw the wars and 
bloodshed produced by that very Church which ought to have been 
the chief guardian of the world's peace. 

	|70-75.~  By the time the Pilgrims reached the Fourth Terrace the
last rays of daylight were striking so far above them on the 
Mountain-top that the stars were beginning to appear on all 
sides.  Already Dante's climbing power was giving way: 
 
       `O virtue mine, why dost thou thus dissolve?' 
       Within myself I said; for I perceived 
       The power of my legs was put in truce.
 
This probably refers partly to the general law of Mount Purgatory 
by which climbing is impossible once the night falls; but we 
cannot be mistaken in seeing in it also an effect of the Terrace 
of Sloth, on which the poets have now arrived.  It is Dante's way 
of confessing this sin -- the slack, half-hearted, halting 
pursuit of the good: the obvious opposite of the swift and 
strenuous running of the souls on this Terrace, who refuse to 
halt for a moment to hold converse with him. 
 
	|79-87.~  The night, however, is not spent in absolute
slothfulness, for while action is suspended, thought and contemplation
are thereby urged into greater activity.  When Dante arrived on the two
Terraces preceding, his first intimation of where he was came to him
from voices in the air, and, remembering this, he now listens eagerly
for some sound in the darkness from which he 
might infer the nature of this new sin.  Absolute silence reigns; 
and in reply to his question, Virgil gives him the necessary 
information: 
 
               `The love of the good minished {^sic~}
       Of its duty, right here restores itself; 
       Here is plied again the ill-belated oar.'
 
This is not a description of Sloth in general, but of Sloth in 
the pursuit of good.  A certain love of the good is presupposed, 
but it is not strong enough to fulfil itself in duty, to embody 
itself in right action.  It is the sin of `the unlit lamp and the 
ungirt loin,' a deeper degree of that inconstancy of will which 
set some of the redeemed in the lowest Heaven of the inconstant 
changing Moon (^Par.~ II. 25ff.).  The darkness of the night which has
fallen on the Terrace is an essential part of the symbolism.   Virgil
compares the slothful soul to a rower who has trifled away the hours of
daylight, and must now ply his oars more strenuously to 
make up for lost time, but without the sun as guide.  To love the 
good without fulfilling it in duty is to create within the soul 
the night in which no man can work; and even repentance cannot in 
a moment call back the day that might have been.  The souls on 
this Terrace, as we shall see, run in a very passion of eagerness 
to redeem the time, but it is in that moral darkness which must 
fall when, seeing the good and, in a certain sense, loving it, we 
yet cannot summon up fortitude and energy to carry it into life 
and action. 
 
	|91-139.~  Virgil utilizes the enforced delay by delivering a
series of ethical disquisitions, which constitute, in Dean Plumptre's
words, `the "meditation" of the "retreat."'  The first consists 
of an exposition of the moral structure of the Purgatorio, the 
fundamental principle of the classification of its Seven Deadly 
Sins.  It corresponds to the discourse in the Eleventh Canto 
of the ^Inferno~ on the sins of the lost.  Every sin of the Mount 
is traced to the universal root of Love, without which neither 
Creator nor creature can exist.  Love is of two kinds: `natural' 
or instinctive, which makes for its object without possibility of 
error; and spiritual or rational (^d'animo~), into which enter 
processes of reasoning, weighing, judging, choosing, and, with 
these, the possibility of going astray.  This error may happen in 
one of three ways: 
 
                         `Through an evil object, 
       Or through too little, or through too much vigour.' 
 
These words indicate the threefold division into which the Seven 
Deadly Sins fall through the perversion, the defect, and the 
excess of Love.  Love perverted aims at an evil object.  The 
evil, Virgil declares, cannot be directed against a man's self, 
for, as St. Paul says, `no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but 
nourisheth and cherisheth it.'  Aquinas discusses the question 
whether it is possible for any one to hate himself, and replies 
that, properly speaking, it is not.  It never happens except by 
accident, as when a man seeks an evil for himself believing it to 
be good, or mistakes his bodily and sensitive nature for his true 
self (^Summa~, i-ii, q. xxix, a. 4; Eph. v. 29).  Even when a man
commits suicide, it is in the belief, however mistaken, that the
desperate deed is the best thing for him under the circumstances. 
 
Just as little is it possible to hate God.  This seems to 
contradict passages in the ^Inferno~ which represent sinners 
blaspheming, cursing, and defying God.  The contradiction from 
Dante's view-point is only apparent.  His meaning is that no one 
can hate God ^as God~, as the Eternal Goodness, -- hate rises 
only out of certain effects of God, such as His forbidding of 
evil pleasure, and the recoil of His laws upon the sinner.  In 
this Dante is again following Aquinas, who distinguishes God in 
His essence and in His effects: `God in His Essence is Goodness 
itself, which none can hate, because it is of the nature of good 
to be loved: and therefore it is impossible for any one seeing 
God in His Essence to hate Him....  But some effects wrought by God 
are repugnant to an inordinate will, as the infliction of 
punishment, and also the prohibition of sins by the divine law; 
and in consideration of such effects God may be hated by some 
persons, inasmuch as He is the prohibitor of sins and the 
inflictor of punishments' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxiv, a. 1).
 
If, then, this love of evil is not directed against 
either self or God, it remains that it must be against our 
neighbour.  It assumes the three forms punished on the three 
lowest Terraces -- Pride, which, in the words of Aquinas, is 
`love of one's own excellence, inasmuch as out of this love 
springs the inordinate desire of excelling others, which properly 
belongs to pride'; Envy, which is `sadness at another's good,' 
because it threatens to eclipse ours; and Anger, which is a 
mortal sin when one desires an unjust vengeance, which is 
`contrary to charity and justice.'  Virgil's words are little 
more than a paraphrase of Aquinas (for Pride, see ^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
clxii.; Envy, ii-ii, q. xxxvi,; Anger, ii-ii, q. clviii): 
 
       `There is who by abasement of his neighbour 
       Hopes to excel, and for this only longs 
       That from his greatness he may be cast down. 
       There is who power, grace, honour and fame 
       Fears he may lose, because another rises; 
       Whence he so saddens that he loves the contrary. 
       And there is who through injury appears so shamed 
       That for revenge he is made greedy, 
       And such must needs seek out another's ill.' {vv. 115-123}
 
The remaining sins spring in various ways out of a confused 
conception of some good in which the mind may rest.  Defective 
Love draws men towards the good, either in contemplation or in 
practice, but so slackly that their Sloth, after due repentance, 
must be paid for in suffering on this Fourth Terrace.  The other 
three spring from an excess of Love -- Avarice, Gluttony, 
Sensuality,  The objects of these are not evil in themselves, but 
they constitute an inferior good which cannot create happiness.  
To pursue them beyond the bounds of reason, as if they were `the 
good essence, of every good the fruit and root,' is to lavish 
love upon them inordinately, beyond their true intrinsic worth.  
Virgil leaves Dante to find out from experience on the Terraces 
above how the threefold sin branches out from the one root of 
excessive Love.  `It is,' as Mr. Gardner says, `practically a 
sermon on the Franciscan text, "Set Love in order, thou that 
lovest me."'  Love in order, set to the right objects and in the 
right measure, is the root of every virtue; the selfsame Love in 
disorder is equally the root of every vice (E. G. Gardner's ^Dante~, p.
107.  `Love's tendency to good is the precious material upon which Free
Will acts like the craftsman's hand, to fashion a satyr's mask or a
crucifex' [p. 110]).
