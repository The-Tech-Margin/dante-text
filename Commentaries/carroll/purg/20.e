	|1-3.~  `The sponge' of his curiosity, to use his own figure, is
not yet completely filled with water; but he recognizes that the
penitent's wish for purity is better than his own for knowledge.  His
Guide and he therefore take their way close along the base of the rocky
rampart, the penitents, as we saw, lying between them and the edge of
the precipice which falls to the Terrace below.

	|4-9.~  They lie so near the edge of the Terrace that Dante 
and Virgil have to walk at the foot of the cliff on the inner 
side, `as one goes along a wall close to the battlements.'  The meaning
is that they are set as near as possible to the edge 
of the precipice which falls down to the Terrace of Sloth, to 
indicate the power of that sin still within them.  Accidia is a 
torpor in the pursuit of the true good; and these souls, in whom 
Avarice has quenched the love of good, still hang on the edge of 
that sin.  With tears and sighs they lie there lamenting that 
woeful squandering of the treasure of righteous love, for the sake 
of hoarding up the dust.

	|10-15.~  The sight of them distilling drop by drop 
 
       Through their eyes the ill which all the world pervades, 
 
rouses his indignation: 
 
       Accursed mayst thou be, thou old She-wolf 
       That more than all the other beasts hast prey, 
       Because of hunger infinitely hollow! 
       O heaven, in whose circling it seems to be believed 
       That the conditions here below transmuted are, 
       When will he come thro' whom she shall depart? 
 
This passage seems decisive of the meaning of the She-wolf which 
met him at the outset of his pilgrimage -- the fiercest of the 
three beasts which opposed his deliverance from the dark and 
savage wood.  Whatever more she may symbolize, her primary 
significance is Avarice.  In the description of her in the 
^Inferno~ there is the same bottomless hunger, only the keener 
for being fed, the same multitude of her victims, the same cry 
for a deliverer.  Here, however, the cry is much vaguer: perhaps 
in the interval Dante felt that the Greyhound, whoever he was, 
who was to hunt her down and drive her back to Hell, had failed 
to fulfil his hopes (^Inf.~ I. 49-60; 91-111).
 
While the primary meaning is thus undoubtedly the vice of 
Avarice, there seems to be good grounds for identifying the She-wolf,
in a secondary sense, with the Papacy, as the chief representative of
the sin.  As we have just seen, the first soul singled out on this
Terrace is an avaricious Pope.  In the Fourth Circle of Hell, guarded
by the `accursed wolf' Plutus, Dante sees on the left hand, and
therefore amont the Misers, a great many tonsured heads, and Virgil
informs him (^Inf.~ VII. 46-48), 
  
       `These were clerics, who have no covering 
       Of hair upon the head, and Popes and Cardinals, 
       In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.'
 
When the vice grows so vile as to turn the very Church into its 
tool and victim, as in Simony, a special ^Bolgia~ is provided for 
it in the Eighth Circle, and simoniacal Popes, in a long infernal 
succession, are driven head-foremost, one on the top of the other, 
into the heart of the rock.  It is not meant, of course, that the 
Papacy had any monopoly of the vice, but that it was most deeply 
polluted with it, and perhaps also that its power of corruption 
was greater in men who professed solemnly to have given up the 
world.  Probably the deliverer Dante longed for was some form of 
the temporal power to restrain the Papal greed; but he had learnt 
by bitter experience that the temporal power only curbed the 
avarice of Popes in order the more freely to indulge its own.  A 
great part of the Twentieth Canto is occupied with a description 
of the insatiable cupidity of the royal house of France which 
shrank from no crime.  There is a note of despondency in Dante's 
question, 
 
       When will he come through whom she shall depart? 
 
We may conjecture that the passage was written during that period 
of suspense when Henry VII. was hesitating about his descent into 
Italy.  For avarice, the Papacy had sold herself to a king who, 
for avarice, had bought her, and Heaven seemed to look down with 
careless eyes.  The She-wolf ravaged Church and State with 
impartial greed, and no revolution of the stars brought the 
predestined man, born to hunt her back to her native Hell (^Inf.~ I.
111) -- 
 
       There from whence envy first did let her loose.

	|16-18.~  We come now to the `whip' and the `bridle' of Avarice. 
 As the poets pass on `with steps slow and scant,' their attention is
arrested by one voice which rises into articulate speech above 
the general weeping and moaning of the prostrate penitents.  It 
is that of Hugh Capet, King of France, and founder of the famous 
Capetian dynasty, who explains the mode of their meditations.  In 
the first place, they find expression in words according to 
individual impulse.  They do indeed chant in unison; but whether 
with loud voice or low depends on the strength of the `affection' 
at the moment for liberality or against avarice.  That is why 
Hugh Capet's was the only voice Dante heard -- he alone of all 
the souls on that part of the Terrace was sufficiently moved by 
the inward impulse {^Purg.~ XX. 118-123}.  We may suppose two reasons
for this peculiarity, to which Dante draws special attention.  The
first is that, as Avarice is an individual vice, assuming a separate 
form in each separate soul, so must there be a certain 
individuality in the meditations by which its power is broken.  
The second relates to the fluctuations of the `affection.'  As we 
saw, Avarice `extinguishes love to every good,' and, once 
extinguished, it is impossible to rekindle it into a warm glowing 
flame in a moment.  The rise and fall of the voice, sinking at 
times to mere sobbing and weeping, represents the ebb and flow of 
that `love of good' which Avarice has a peculiar power to quench.  
To the penitent soul it comes back at first only in momentary 
impulses. 
 
	|19-24.~  Nevertheless, these impulses, though momentary and 
fluctuating, Dante seems to say, are peculiarly intense.  In the 
other Terraces where the souls themselves repeat examples of the 
virtue and the vice, as those of Sloth and Sensuality, it is to 
be noted that they simply rehearse them in the form of historical 
statements of fact, such as, to take an instance, `Mary ran with 
haste into the hill-country.'  But here historical statement is 
exchanged for ^direct personal address and intercourse~: 
 
       And I by peradventure heard `Sweet Mary!' 
       In front of us called thus in the wailing, 
       Even as a woman doth who is in travail: 
       And in continuance: `So poor wast thou, 
       As may be witnessed by that hostelry 
       Where thou didst lay thy holy burden down.'
 
In a writer so careful as Dante, this change from historical 
statement to personal address must have some purpose beyond that 
of mere variety.  We may regard it as a sign of the intensity of 
the impulse of the `affection' which urges them to speech: it 
carries them beyond mere historical example into personal 
intercourse -- they see and hear the men and women, they stand 
before them as in life, they speak with them face to face.  It 
seems as if Dante wished to tell us that this sin yields to 
nothing but personal contact and intercourse.  No mere recitation 
of historical examples of Liberality will create the love of that 
virtue -- you must live with liberal souls until you catch the 
contagion of their generosity.  On the other hand, abhorrence of 
Avarice is best awakened by being brought into personal contact 
with the victims of that vice: the sin and meanness of it become 
doubly hideous and hateful when one sees them embodied in a man 
and working out in life and action.  In all the Terraces, Dante 
aims at some correspondence between the form of the meditation 
and the sin to be purged away; and it is difficult to see what it 
is here, if it does not lie somewhere in the direction indicated. 
 
The speaker at the moment of Dante's passing was Hugh 
Capet, and it cannot but strike the reader as something very 
peculiar, to say the least, that it is a ^man~ who breaks out 
into the cry of `Sweet Mary!' exactly after the fashion of a 
woman in travail, his very voice wailing into the same kind of 
agony.  (Comp. ^Par.~ XV. 133: `The Virgin Mary was invoked by women in
labour, as the virgin goddess Diana had been in Pagan times'
[^Paradiso~ in Temple Classics, p. 190].)  The mere fact that it is the
birth of Christ he is commemorating is not a sufficient explanation;
the whole question being just why this should draw the voice of the
founder of a great dynasty of kings into a sympathetic wail, as if he
too felt the same pangs of travail.  Strange and even grotesque as it
may sound, the reason seems to lie in the fact that he ^was~ the
founder of such a dynasty.  When he thought of the poor inn where Mary
`laid her holy burden down,' he could not help moaning to think of that
^un~holy burden of his own progeny, whose sins of 
avarice he is just about to relate.  That `holy burden' of Mary 
was, in the faith of Christendom, the King of kings, laying aside 
His royal robes, and stooping to the poverty of the manger of 
Bethlehem; whereas his own sinful brood climbed up to kinghood 
from the stable (for he himself, he says, was only the son of a 
butcher), and shrank from no vice or crime that Avarice could 
suggest, in order to increase their wealth, and territory, and 
power.  There is, of course, an element of grotesqueness in thus, 
as it were, transforming Hugh Capet into a woman in travail; but 
it will be difficult to account for it in any other way than by 
this contrast between the holy birth of Bethlehem and the unholy 
brood which he had brought forth to undo the work of Christ: 
 
       `I was the root of that malignant plant 
       Which overshadows all the Christian world, 
       So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it.'
                                        {vv. 43-45}
 
	|25-27.~  The second example of voluntary poverty is drawn from
the history of Rome, -- the `good Fabricius,' who preferred poverty 
with virtue to wealth with vice.  The reference is to Caius 
Fabricius (Consul B.C. 282, Censor 275), in Dante's regard one of 
the most heroic types of ancient Roman virtue.  Two instances of 
his utter contempt of wealth are referred to in the ^Convito~ and 
the ^De Monarchia~: his refusal of the rich gifts offered by the 
Samnites when he was negotiating with them for peace, and of the 
splendid brides with which Pyrrhus of Epirus strove to buy him 
over to his service, when he was arranging an exchange of 
prisoners of war.  `Has not Fabricius left us a lofty example of 
resisting avarice, when, poor man as he was, for the faith by 
which he was bound to the republic, he laughed to scorn the great 
weight of gold which was offered him, and refused it, scorning it 
with words which became him well.  His story too is confirmed by 
our poet in the sixth ^AEneid~, where he speaks of "Fabricius 
strong in his poverty"' (^De Mon.~ ii. 5; ^Conv.~ iv. 5; ^Aen.~ vi.
843, `parvoque potenetem Fabricium').  He stands out in the poet's 
imagination as a Roman of the old simple heroic breed, 
incorruptible in his loyalty to his country, unseduced by the 
growing love of luxury, contented with his hereditary farm, and 
dying as he had lived a poor man. 
 
	|31-33.~  The third example brings us back to the Christian Church
in the person of St. Nicholas, Bishop of Myra in Lycia in the 
fourth century, sometimes called St. Nicholas of Bari in Apulia, 
because his body was transported thither some seven or eight 
centuries later, and dear to the hearts of the children of 
Christendom as Santa Klaus.  The story of his `largess to the 
maidens,' as told in ^The Golden Legend~, is that, hearing how a 
nobleman who had fallen into poverty purposed to make a living 
out of the shame of his three daughters, Nicholas secretly by 
night threw three bags of gold into his house at different times.  
The maidens being thus well dowered were all honourably married.  
It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that Dante tells the story 
with a side glance at Bishops who used their gold for a very 
different purpose.  Fabricius and Nicholas represent respectively 
that contempt for wealth, and that generous use of it, without 
which neither State nor Church can remain rich in strength and 
purity.  (In Art, St. Nicholas is generally represented with three
balls for the three purses of gold.  For other interpretations, see
Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, ii. 457.)
 
	|61-84.~  These are the great examples of Avarice which act as 
`bridle' to the whole Terrace; but Hugh Capet has a private 
supplementary list, -- the members of his own house.  There seems 
to be no doubt that Dante has in some way confused Hugh Capet the 
King and his father Hugh the Great, the statements referring 
sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other.  Fortunately the 
divergences from historical facts do not obscure the fierce 
indictment Dante hurls against the royal house of France, which 
he plainly regards as the crowning example of the vice of Avarice 
on a grand hereditary scale.  (The chief points of divergence are the
following:

(1) The Hugh Capet here says he was `the son of a butcher of
Paris.'  This was the generally received tradition in Dante's day
[Villani, iv. 4], and doubtless he was not sorry to humble the pride of
the house by recalling it.  But the tradition refers not to Hugh the
King, but to his father Hugh the Great, who was in reality a descendant
of the Counts of Paris.

(2) The speaker says he grasped the reins of power at the time
when `the ancient kings' came to an end, with the exception of one who
`gave himself to grey garments,' ^i~.^e~. became a monk.  This
reference to a monk shows that Dante has confused the Carlovingian
Kings with the Merovingian.  The last Merovingian King was Childeric
III., who was deposed by Pepin in 752, and compelled to retire to the
monastery of Sithien at St. Omer where he died three years later.  Then
came the Carlovingian dynasty, which lasted down to 987.  The last of
this line was Charles, Duke of Lorraine, whom France refused to accept
as king because he was a vassal of the German Emperor.  It was at this
point Hugh Capet seized the throne [his father, Hugh the Great, had
died more than thirty years before].  This Charles of Lorraine is
obviously the last of `the ancient kings' referred to, but, since he
never became a monk, it is evident that he is confused with the last of
the Merovingians, Childeric III., who died more than two hundred years
earlier.

(3) The speaker says his son's head received `the widowed crown'
of France.  It is difficult to understand this.  The speaker cannot be,
except by confusion, Hugh the Great, since he was dead for more than
thirty years when his son became king.  If the speaker is Hugh the
King, then it was to his own head `the widowed crown' was first
promoted.  The difficulty is not quite removed by the fact that he
associated his son Robert with him in the government, and had him
crowned in the year 988.)

The passage is as follows: 
 
       `So long as the great dowry of Provence 
       Out of my blood took not the sense of shame, 
       `Twas little worth, but still it did no evil. 
       There began with both force and falsehood 
       Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends, 
       Ponthieu and Normandy it seized, and Gascony. 
       Charles came to Italy, and, for amends, 
       A victim made of Conradin, and then 
       Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends. 
       A time I see, not very distant now, 
       Which draws another Charles forth from France, 
       The better to make known both him and his. 
       Without arms he issues thence alone, and with the lance 
       That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts 
       So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst. 
       He thence not land, but sin and shame 
       Shall win, for himself so much more grievous, 
       As the more light he counts such wrong. 
       The other, who late went forth a captive from a ship, 
       See I his daughter sell, and haggle over her, 
       As do the corsairs with the other women-slaves. 
       O Avarice, what more canst thou do to us, 
       Since thou my blood to thee hast drawn so 
       It careth not for its own proper flesh?'
 
Never was there a more bitter indictment of a royal house.  Its 
ruling passion was Avarice; its dark shadow lay across the 
Christian world, cutting off God's sunlight, and dooming it to 
barrenness.  The beginning of its career of rapine was `the great 
Provencal dowry,' -- the reference being to the marriage of Louis 
IX. and his brother, Charles of Anjou, to Margaret and Beatrice, 
daughters of the Court of Provence.  Dante traces to this 
alliance all the disastrous intrusions of France into the affairs 
of Italy.  Villani expressly says that the invasion of Apulia by 
Charles of Anjou was due to the determination of his wife 
Beatrice to be a queen like her three elder sisters (^Chronicle~, vi.
89; see ^Purg.~ VII. 128 and {comm. to ^Purg.~ 7.91-136).  The 
reference to Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony relates to the 
struggle between France and England for possession of those 
provinces.  There is probably some chronological confusion; but, 
as Dr. Oelsner says, Dante is `right in all the essential facts, 
which held good, as stated by him, for many years.  Thus, Villani 
says that Edward III., when on the point of invading France in 
1346, told his barons that the French King "was wrongfully 
occupying Gascony, and the county of Ponthieu, which came to him 
(Edward) with the dowry of his mother, and that he was holding 
Normandy by fraud" (xii. 63)' (^Purgatorio~, Temple Classics, p. 253). 
Dante plainly took the same view many years earlier. 

The reference to Charles of Anjou in ll. 67-69 has a 
peculiar bitterness of sarcasm.  The threefold repetition of the 
words `for amends' at once arrests attention.  The irony is 
obvious, but its precise point is not quite so easily seen.  It 
consists in the fact that a greater sin throws a lesser into 
insignificance, and thereby makes a species of `amends' for it.  
Dante gives two examples elsewhere.  In Ca,ina, Camicion de' Pazzi 
says he is `waiting for Carlino to ^excuse~ him.'  What he means 
is that his kinsman Carlino de' Pazzi would do a still darker 
deed of treachery, which would make his own sin appear a mere 
trifle (^Inf.~ XXXII. 69).  The other instance is a few lines further
on in the present Canto.  Hugh Capet narrates the outrage on Boniface
VIII., -- `in order that the future evil and the past ^may seem 
less~ {v. 85}.  That outrage was the crowning sin of the wicked 
dynasty: it threw all past crimes into the shade, and nothing the 
future might contain could ever equal it.  This is the special 
point of irony in the words `for amends': it is the making of one 
sin seem small by the stock of a greater.  The French Kings began 
their rapine in Provence, and turned this into a mere trifle by 
their seizure of Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.  Charles of 
Anjou invaded Italy, and, `for amends, made a victim of 
Conradin': the cold-blooded execution of the last of the 
Hohenstaufens, a mere boy in years, gave the invasion almost the 
hue of virtue by comparison.  This heartless murder was in its 
turn `excused' by a worse: `he then thrust Thomas back to heaven, 
for amends.'  The reference is to the death of St. Thomas 
Aquinas, which was then commonly attributed to Charles.  The 
story was that when Thomas was summoned by Gregory X. to the 
Council of Lyons in 1274, Charles asked him before he left Naples 
what he would reply if the Pope asked about him.  `I shall tell 
the truth,' said Thomas: an answer which so alarmed the king that 
he had him poisoned by one of his physicians at the Cistercian 
monastery of Fossa Nuova, near Terracina, on the borders of 
Campania and Latium.  It is only fair to Charles to say that the 
story is now entirely discredited; but Dante, to whom it was 
true, regarded the murder of the great theologian and saint as 
throwing even that of the poor boy Conradin into comparative 
insignificance.  We must remember that it is this same Charles 
whom we saw singing in the Valley of the Princes below.  Dante 
firmly believed he had commited these crimes, yet on the strength 
of a story that he had repented on his death-bed, he sets him 
there on his way to Paradise.  So omnipotent did he believe the 
power of repentance to be, and so wide the arms of God's grace.  
It also shows that Dante did not, as is too commonly believed, 
consign men to Heaven or Hell according to his personal loves and 
hatreds; had he done so, nothing could have been easier than to 
have swept aside the story of his death-bed repentance, and 
plunged Charles up to the neck in the River of Blood in the 
Inferno. 
 
We come now to a second Charles, to whom Dante owed his 
banishment.  In 1300 the Priors of Florence, of whom the poet 
was one, found it necessary to crush the strife between the Black 
and White Guelphs by banishing their leaders.  In response to the 
appeal of the Blacks, Boniface VIII. sent Charles of Valois, 
brother of Philip the Fair, as `peacemaker' to Florence the 
following year.  His manner of `peacemaking' was simple enough: 
he treacherously broke his oaths and pledges, armed his horsemen, 
flung open the gates to the Blacks, and gave up the city to 
rapine and bloodshed.  This was `the lance that Judas jousted 
with' -- not merely treachery, but treachery bought and paid for 
by priests.  Even the Guelph Villani states that in banishing the 
Whites and Ghibellines and confiscating their property, Charles 
acted `by commission of Pope Boniface' (^Chronicle~, viii. 49).  When
we remember that Dante himself was one of the exiles, it is no wonder
that he is bitter at the Judas who sold him, and more bitter at the
priest who bought his treachery. 
 
A third Charles is held up to infamy as one who sold his 
own flesh and blood -- Charles II., son of Charles of Anjou.  He 
is spoken of as one `who late went forth a captive from a ship,' 
in reference to his capture in 1284, while still Prince of 
Salerno, by Roger di Loria, the Sicilian admiral of Peter III. of 
Aragon.  In 1305 he sold his youngest daughter Beatrice to Azzo 
VIII., Marquis of Este, an old scoundrel, if Dante is to be 
believed -- traitor, parricide, libertine.  The only evidence for 
the vile transaction is a passage in Dino Compagni (iii. 16) in 
which the cities of Modena and Reggio are named as the price of 
the beautiful girl. 
 
	|85-96.~  As Hugh Capet thinks of his descendant haggling over his
own flesh and blood, `as corsairs do over the other women-slaves,' he
almost defies Avarice to sink his race lower.  Yet 
there is `in the lowest deep a lower deep' -- the avarice of 
Philip the Fair, which outraged the very Church of Christ and 
`crucified the Son of God afresh': 
 
       `That less may seem the future evil and the past, 
       I see the fleur-de-lys Alagna enter, 
       And Christ in His own vicar captive made. 
       I see Him yet another time derided; 
       I see renewad the vinegar and the gall, 
       And between living thieves I see Him slain. 
       I see the new Pilate so relentless 
       This doth not sate him, but without decree 
       He bears his greedy sails into the Temple. 
       O my Lord! when shall I be joyful 
       To see the vengeance, which, being hidden 
       In thy secret counsel, makes thine anger sweet?'
 
(The idea seems to be that there is a certain joy in the anger of God
because his secret counsel has already ordained the vengeance for such
wickedness.  Man's anger, even when just, is often bitter, because it
seems as if there were no Divine vengeance.  Comp. ^Par.~ XXII. 13-18. 
Alagna or Anagna is now Anagni.)

The outrage on Boniface VIII. in Anagni in 1303 was the final act 
of the great quarrel for supremacy which he had carried on for 
years with Philip the Fair.  In justice to Philip, it must be 
confessed that he was but defending the rights of France as a 
nation.  War was going on between France and England, and both 
countries refused the Pope's arbitration.  Boniface, who believed 
himself master of all Christendom, retorted by the Bull ^Clericis 
laicos~, in which he forbade the clergy to pay taxes to the 
secular power.  Philip replied by forbidding money to be sent out 
of France, thus cutting off all contributions to Rome.  The Pope 
was forced to yield for the moment, but a new storm broke out 
over the question of vacant benefices which were claimed by the 
crown.  Philip threw the papal legate into prison; whereupon 
Boniface addressed another Bull to him, claiming absolute power 
over kings, and summoning the French clergy to a Council in Rome, 
to pass sentence on his conduct.  The King burnt the Bull in 
public, and forbade the clergy to go.  The outrage at Anagni was 
the tragic and dramatic ending of the struggle.  Philip resolved 
to capture the old man and arraign him before a Council at Lyons.  
The plot was entrusted to the hands of William of Nogaret, a 
doctor of law.  In company with Sciarra Colonna, a hereditary 
enemy of the Pope, Nogaret stormed his palace at Anagni and burst 
into his audience chamber.  The scene is vividly described by 
Gregorovius.  `They found themselves in the presence of an old 
man clad in pontifical vestments, the tiara on his head, seated 
upon a throne, and bowed over a gold cross which he held in his 
hands.  He was resolved to die as Pope.  His venerable age and 
his majestic silence disarmed the men for an instant, then with 
yells they demanded his degradation, declared that they would 
carry him in chains to Lyons to be deposed, and allowed 
themselves to descend to insults, which he bore with magnanimity.  
The wild Sciarra seized him by the arm, dragged him from the 
throne, and would have thrust his dagger in his breast.  Nogaret 
held his companion back by force.  The ferocity, the excitement, 
the terror and despair knew no bounds; moderation, however, 
finally triumphed over passion' (^Rome in the Middle Ages~, v. 590
[English Translation]).  He was thrown into prison and his palace and
the cathedral given over to plunder.  After three days of imprisonment
the citizens rose and set him free; but it was too late.   The shock to
the proud old man who believed himself the master of the world, seems
to have upset his mind.  Villani's account of the end has a touch of
weirdness: `Pope Boniface, seeing himself free, and his enemies driven
away, did not therefore rejoice in any wise, forasmuch as the pain of
his adversity had so entered into his heart and clotted there;
wherefore he departed straightway from Anagna with all his court, and
came to Rome to S. Peter's to hold a council, purposing to take the
heaviest vengeance for his injury and that of Holy Church against the
King of France, and whosoever had offended him; but, as it pleased God,
the grief which had hardened in the heart of Pope Boniface, by reason
of the injury which he had received, produced in him, after he was come
to Rome, a strange malady, so that he gnawed at himself as if he were
mad, and in this state he passed from this life on the 12th day of
October in the year of Christ 1303' (^Chronicle~, viii. 63).
 
It is characteristic of Dante that he should see in this 
outrage a repetition of the Crucifixion of Christ.  It may have 
been suggested, as Dr. Moore thinks, by the Pope's own words.  
Villani tells us that when Boniface found his palace taken, he 
said courageously: `Since, like Jesus Christ, I am willing to be 
taken and needs must die by treachery, at the least I desire to 
die as Pope.'  But the idea was natural to Dante apart from this.  
No matter how unworthy a Pope might be, he could never forget 
that, in virtue of his office, he was Christ's vicar, and 
therefore that any indignity offered to the office was an insult 
to Christ Himself.  (It is true that to Dante Boniface was a mere
usurper [^Par.~ XXVII. 22-27]; but to Philip he was rightful Pope, and
therefore his outrage was committed upon Christ's representative.)  We
know that he sternly consigned Boniface to the Moat of the Simoniacs in
the Inferno; none the less did he regard this outrage with abhorrence. 
He knew it was not an attack on an individual but upon the Church; and
the transference of the Papacy to Avignon and the election of Clement
V. to be Philip's creature and tool, are the natural and inevitable
issues of the outrage.  When he says he saw `Christ in His own vicar 
captive made,' it is not the mere imprisonment of Boniface for 
three days he is thinking of: it is the degradation and 
enslavement of the Church by the State, of the spiritual power by 
the temporal.  The man who thus delivered Christ to His enemies 
is called `the new Pilate,' and William of Nogaret and Sciarra 
Colonna are the `^living~ thieves' between whom Christ in His 
vicar is once more slain.  The word `living' indicates the 
contrast between the modern thieves and the ancient.  The latter 
`received the due reward of their deeds' in death; the former 
lived to enjoy the fruits of their robbery.  (The variant ^nuovi
ladroni~ [new thieves] misses the very point of Dante's contrast, which
is that they are living [^vivi~] to enjoy their villany.)
 
The second crime charged against Philip is his inhuman 
suppression of the great military Order of Knights Templars on 
the ground of heresy, sacrilege, and unnatural vices.  Nothing 
was really proved against the Templars.  In their confessions, 
wrung from them by torture, they were, as Milman says, `wildly 
bidding for their lives.'  `It was inevitable,' writes Professor 
Lodge, `that a Celibate society of warriors should give occasion 
for the belief that the vow of chastity was not always observed.  
It is credible that in their intercourse with the Saracens many 
of the Knights may have been led into unbelief, or even to adopt 
a contemptuous and irreverent attitude towards Christianity.  But 
it is not credible that the whole Order was guilty of the 
obscenity, blasphemy, and irreligion charged against it.   Confessions
extorted under horrible tortures and recanted when health and sanity
were restored, do not constitute evidence from which any reasonable
conclusions can be drawn' (^The Close of the Middle Ages~, p. 55). 
When Dante charges Philip with having suppressed the Order `without
decree,' he means something more definite than the absence of fair
trial.  In point of fact, Clement V. did issue a decree for its
suppression, the Bull ^Vox in excelso~, dated March 22, 1312.  But from
Dante's point of view Clement was not the rightful Pope, and therefore
had no authority to issue decrees: in doing so, he was simply the tool
of Philip's avarice, the wind that bore `his greedy sails into the
Temple.'  (Compare Canto XXXIII. 34-35, where Beatrice declares that
the Church `was, and is not.'  In calling Philip `the new Pilate,'
Dante would remind us that the old Pilate also acted `without decree.' 
For the Bull suppressing the Order, see Gregorovius, ^Rome in the
Middle Ages~, vi. 96n. [English Translation].)  The true reason for the
suppression was the King's determination to fill his coffers with the
Templars' wealth.  `The King,' writes Villani (viii. 92), `was moved by
his avarice, and made secret arrangements with the Pope and caused him
to promise to destroy the Order of the Templars, laying to their charge
many articles of heresy; but it is said that it was more in hope of
extracting great sums of money from them, and by reason of offence
taken against the master of the Temple and the Order.  The Pope, to be
rid of the King of France, by reason of the request which he had made
that he would condemn Pope Boniface, as we have said before, whether
rightly or wrongly, to please the King promised that he would do this.' 
(The allusion to `secret arrangements' refers to the six conditions
imposed by Philip on Clement before he had him elected Pope: [1] The
annulling of the sentence of excommunication passed on him by Boniface. 
[2] The absolution of Nogaret and all others concerned in the outrage
at Anagni.  [3] A tithe of their incomes to be paid to Philip by the
clergy for five years.  [4] The condemnation of the memory of Boniface. 
[5] The restoration of the two Colonnas excommunicated by Boniface to
their estates and their ranks as cardinals.  [6] A secret condition to
be disclosed in its due time and place.  This is generally believed to
have been the suppression of the Templars.  Clement tried to escape
from destroying the Order, but Philip held him to it by the threat of
making him fulfil the fourth condition.  The Templars were flung to the
wolves in order to save the memory of Boniface from dishonour.  See
Villani, viii. 80, 92; Milman, ^Latin Christianity~, Bk. XII.;
Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, Bk. XI, ch. ii.)  The case
dragged on from 1307 to 1314, when Jacques du Molay, the Master of the
Order, was publicly burnt alive in the presence of the King.  So nobly
did he bear himself that the popular imagination transfigured him into
a martyr.  The story rose that out of the flames the old man summoned
Pope and King to meet him within forty days before the throne of the
Most High.  Its origin was probably the fact that both Clement and
Philip died in the following year, -- the latter at the early age of 
forty-six.  The absence of any reference to their deaths in the 
passage before us may be taken as proof that it was written prior 
to 1314.  Dante puts a prayer for vengeance into the mouth of 
Hugh Capet; and if Pope and King had been already dead, he would 
certainly, as in other cases, have thrown it into the form of 
prophecy of the impending judgment of Heaven upon their almost 
unparalleled wickedness.  (This is undoubtedly how their deaths were
regarded by the world in general.  See Villani's ^Chronicle~, ix. 59,
66.)

	|100-117.~  These, and such as these, are the souls the penitents
converse with during the day, obviously because Liberality is a virtue
of the daylight, open and generous, with nothing dark or 
underhand to conceal.  The night brings on `a contrary sound.'  
The idea is, perhaps, that the nightfall recalls the memory of 
their own schemes of Avarice over which they once brooded in the 
darkness, and which must now be fought by resolute contemplation 
of men and women who perished in their greed.  Seven examples are 
given, as if to show the entire gamut of this vice.  As Dr. Moore 
points out, they are arranged in three groups, parallel to the 
three examples of the virtue: `(1) two instances from profane 
history or legend; (2) three instances from Scripture; and (3) 
again two instances from profane history' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd
Series, p. 253).  They seem to be chosen to show how `the love of money
is a root of all kinds of evil' (1 Tim. vi. 10 [R.V.]), -- sins against
kindred and self, against God and His Church, against the sacred laws
of hospitality, against the human race.  `Then,' that is, during the
night, 
 
                         `we recall Pygmalion, 
       Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide, 
       His own gluttonous wish for gold did make; 
       And the misery of the avaricious Midas, 
       That followed his inordinate demand, 
       At which forevermore one needs must laugh. 
       Of the foolish Achan each one then bethinks him, 
       How he stole the spoils, so that the wrath 
       Of Joshua here appears to bite him still. 
       Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband; 
       We praise the kicks which Heliodorus had; 
       And in infamy the whole mount encircleth 
       Polymnestor who slew Polydorus. 
       Last of all the cry here is: "Crassus, tell us, 
       For thou dost know, of what savour is the gold?"'
 
The head of this black list, Pygmalion, King of Tyre, was a 
traitor to his kindred for the lust of gold.  He slew his uncle 
Sichaeus, husband of his sister Dido, taking him treacherously 
at the very alter, for the sake of his wealth (^Aen.~ i. 340ff.).  The
second example shows how absurdly a man befools himself through
Avarice.  It is the well-known story of Midas, the Phrygian King, who
asked from Bacchus that whatever he touched might turn into gold.  His
greed nearly cost him his life, his very food changing into the 
precious metal.  It is probably an allegory of the rich man whose 
very wealth destroys his appetite, or whose miserly heart will 
not allow him to enjoy his food, because it represents so much 
gold.  This is why the penitents laugh at Midas: he stands for 
starvation in the midst of boundless wealth. 
 
The Scriptural group consists of an example from the Old 
Testament, another from the New, and a third from the Apocrypha; 
and all three may be described as attempts to cheat and rob God.  
Achan's theft of spoil dedicated to God is called `foolish' 
because he bartered for corruptible gold his great inheritance 
among the chosen people.  The fraudulence of Ananias and Sapphira 
was of a still darker hue, cloaking itself in the garb of 
generosity to the Church, and involving, as St. Peter says, `a 
lie to the Holy Ghost.'  The story of Heliodorus tells us of an 
impious and high-handed attempt to rob the Temple of God.  In 2 
Maccabees iii. we read that Seleucus, King of Syria, sent his 
treasurer Heliodorus to seize the treasures which a renegade Jew 
had informed him were laid up in the Temple in Jerusalem.  When 
Heliodorus approached the Treasury, `there appeared an horse with 
a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering 
and glorious in his vesture and apparel, and he ran fiercely, and 
smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that 
sat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.'  All three are 
attempts to defraud God, and all three are punished by God's own 
hand -- the heathen sinner less severely, probably because his 
light was less. 
 
The two final examples are from profane history.  The 
first is one single act of avarice, the second, a whole life's 
career of it.  Shortly before the fall of Troy, Priam, fearing 
for the safety of his youngest son Polydorus, sent him, along 
with a large sum of money, to Polymnestor, King of the Thracian 
Chersonesus.  The Thracian king, the moment he saw Troy crushed, 
broke the sacred laws of hospitality, slew his guest, and seized 
his treasures.  It is at the close of Virgil's account of the 
murder that the well-known words occur which must be examined 
more carefully before we leave this Terrace: 
 
               Quid non mortalia pectora cogis 
       Auri sacra fames! (^Aen.~ iii. 22-57.)
 
The last example of Marcus Licinius Crassus, surnamed 
^Dives~, the Wealthy, whose love of money took the world for its 
prey.  After telling how his estate rose from 300 to 7100 
talents, Plutarch says: `The greatest part of this fortune, if we 
may declare the truth, to his extreme disgrace, was gleaned from 
war and from fires; for he made a traffic of the public 
calamities.'  To this are to be added his vast speculations in 
slaves, mines, and lands; while, on the other hand, justice 
compels us to record that he did what few are inclined to do 
among ourselves, lent money to his friends without interest.  In 
the year 55 B.C. he was consul along with Pompey, and received 
the province of Syria, from which he hoped to wring inexhaustible 
wealth.  Two years later his dreams of avarice came to a sudden 
and tragic end.  The Parthian general Surenas defeated him in 
battle and sent his head to King Orodes, who is said, in mockery 
of his notorious thirst for wealth, to have poured molted gold 
into his mouth.  It is in allusion to this that the penitents ask 
him `the savour of the gold' -- the taste it has in death.  As 
Scartazzini points out, these seven examples correspond to the 
seven `daughters of Avarice' according to Aquinas, Pygmalion 
representing Treachery; Midas, Restlessness; Achan, Fraud; 
Ananias and Sapphira, Perjury; Heliodorus, Deceit; Polymnestor, 
Inhumanity; and Crassus, Violence (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxviii, a. 8). 

	|118-123.~  In the first place, {the penitents} find expression in
words according to individual impulse.  They do indeed chant in unison;
but whether with loud voice or low depends on the strength of the
`affection' at the moment for liberality or against avarice.  That is
why Hugh Capet's was the only voice Dante heard -- he alone of all the
souls on that part of the Terrace was sufficiently moved by the inward
impulse.

	|124-141.~  We have now reached a point at which some new guidance
becomes necessary, to supplement that of Virgil, and it is 
introduced with a startling and dramatic suddenness which sends a 
chill as of death through the poet's heart.  The two Pilgrims had 
just parted with Hugh Capet when a violent earthquake shook the 
Mountain, and a great cry went up on every side of `^Gloria in 
excelsis Deo.~'  They stood in suspense, `like the shepherds who 
first heard that song until the trembling ceased, and the cry 
with it.

	|142-151.~  The penitents resumed their wailing and the poets
their journey -- Dante consumed with thirst to understand what it all
meant.
