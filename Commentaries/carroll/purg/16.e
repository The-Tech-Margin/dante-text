	|1-6.~  We come now to the punishment allotted to the Angry.   As
the poets walked westward against the setting sun, a smoke which 
covered the whole width of the Terrace met them -- an image of 
that darkening of the reason, and the moral faculties, and all 
the plain reality of things, which Anger creates.  It reminds 
Dante of his passage through the Inferno -- the `darkness of 
hell' and of a starless night.  Indeed, his journey had already 
led him through the same dark smoke -- the foggy exhalations of 
the Stygian Fen in whose miry waters the Wrathful tear each 
other (^Inf.~ IX. 75).  It is, indeed, so natural an image of Anger
that the word ^fume~ or smoke is a familiar figure of speech in this
sense -- a man `Fumes with anger.'  The passion burns like a fire in 
the heart and throws off a thick smoke which blinds and bites the 
eyes.  Its blinding power is familiar enough.  `Anger is a short 
madness.'  While the passion lasts, it can see no excuse, no 
palliation of the offence, no rational limit to its vengeance.  
It often turns into a blind fury which shuts its eyes to all 
consequences to itself and others.  A less familiar form of this 
blindness springs from a source seldom thought of, which Aquinas 
points out, namely, that Anger generally believes itself to be 
founded upon reason and justice.  It is a longing for vengeance 
for some wrong, and it usually justifies itself by the thought 
that it is simply inflicting a well-merited punishment upon a 
sinner.  This sense of justice often blinds the angry man to the 
true measures and proportions of justice: the balance trembles in 
the hands of passion, and dips to the side of excessive 
punishment.  Thus the very sense of justice becomes an ally of 
this sin, and changes into a thick smoke which blinds the reason.  
`Hence Gregory says: "The greatest care must be taken that anger, 
which is taken up for an instrument of virtue, come not to have 
dominion over the mind, nor rule as mistress there; but like a 
handmaid ready to serve, let her know her place at the back of 
reason's chair."  Anger such as this, although in the execution 
of the deed it does to some extent impede the judgment of reason, 
still does not destroy the rectitude of reason.  Hence Gregory 
says that "the anger of zeal troubles the eye of reason, but the 
anger of vice quite blinds it"' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clviii, a. 1). 
 
The pain and restlessness of Anger are symbolized by the 
bitterness and `rough texture' of the smoke, which suffered not 
an eye to remain open.  Aquinas, indeed, discussing the question, 
^Does anger cause pleasure?~ replies that it does, partly by 
the hope of revenge, partly by brooding on it, and, if the hope 
is fulfilled, by the infliction of it (^Summa~, i-ii, q. xlviii, a. 1). 
Nevertheless the pleasure cannot really be very great when we turn to
what he calls the six `daughters of Anger': brawling, swelling of
spirit, contumely, clamour, indignation, and blasphemy.   The followers
of Wrath, according to Spenser, are not a merry company (^Faerie
Queene~, Bk. I, C. iv. 35): 
 
       Full many mischiefes follow cruell Wrath: 
       Abhorred bloodshed, and tumultuous strife, 
       Unmanly murder, and unthrifty scath, 
       Bitter despight, with rancours rusty knife, 
       And fretting griefe, the enemy of life: 
       All these, and many evils moe haunt ire, 
       The swelling Splene, and Frenzy raging rife, 
       The shaking Palsey, and Saint Fraunces fire.
 
	|7-15.~  When this bitter blinding smoke closed in round Dante, 
Virgil, his `wise and trusty Escort,' drew near and offered him 
his shoulder, bidding him take care not to be separated from him; 
and thus, like a blind man, he followed him through the darkness.   
Virgil, of course, sustains here his allegorical character of 
Reason.  For, as Aquinas says, anger in itself is not necessarily 
a sin, as envy is.  For `envy from its species involves evil: for 
it is sadness at another's good, of itself an irrational thing; 
and therefore the mere mention of envy points at once to 
something evil.  But this is not the case with anger, or the 
craving for vengeance: for vengeance may be sought either well or 
ill....  To seek vengeance in order to work evil on him who has to 
be punished, is unlawful; but to seek vengeance in order to work 
the correction of vice and the maintenance of the good of 
justice, is praiseworthy.'  `The passion of anger is useful... to 
the end that man may more promptly fulfil what reason dictates'; 
hence `to be devoid of anger when one ought to be angry' is as 
much a vice upon the other side.  But Anger of every kind must 
keep its hand on Reason's shoulder and walk behind him, for he 
alone knows when, and how, and in what measure to be angry.  To 
quote Aristotle, Dante's chief authority upon natural ethics: `A 
Person is praised if he grows angry on the right occasion and 
with the right people, and also in the right manner, at the right 
times and for the right length of time; such a person will be 
good-tempered therefore, as good temper is a term of praise.  For 
a good-tempered person is in effect one who will be cool and not 
carried away by his emotion, but will wax wroth in such a manner, 
on such occasions, and for so long a time, as reason may 
prescribe.  But it seems that he will err rather on the side of 
deficiency; for a good-tempered or gentle person is inclined to 
forgiveness rather than to revenge' (Aquinas, ^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
clviii; Aristotle's ^Ethics~, iv. 11 [Welldon]).  All this is what
Dante means by following Virgil with his hand on his shoulder, and 
listening to no voice but his. 
 
	|16-21.~  Nevertheless, important as this is, there is another aid
even more essential.  Out of the darkness came the sound of 
voices chanting in unison a prayer to the Lamb of God who taketh 
away sin, for peace and mercy (the reference is to the prayer in the
Mass and the Litany of Saints: `Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,
miserere nobis'): 
 
       Only `^Agnus Dei~' were their preludes; 
       One word there was in all, and measure one, 
       So that all concord seemed to be among them.
 
The reference is to the Litany of the Saints.  The penitents are 
`unloosing the knot of anger' in which they are entangled, by 
casting themselves on the meek and gentle Lamb of God whose 
sacrifice is their salvation.  They know that only He who laid 
down life for their forgiveness can lift them up into the power 
of His own forgiving love.  The concord with which they chant the 
`^Agnus Dei~' -- one word and one measure in them all -- shows 
that already something of His peace and mercy is in their hearts.  
The brawling, and contumely, and clamor, and blasphemy, which are 
among `the daughters of Anger,' are banished from their lips by 
the unison of the one word and the one measure of the one prayer 
for each other's salvation.  It is the fulfilment of St. Paul's 
words, which may well have been in Dante's mind: `Let all 
bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, 
be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to 
another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for 
Christ's sake hath forgiven you' (Eph. iv. 31, 32).
 
	|22-39.~  At this point one of the penitents hearing Dante ask if
these were spirits who were chanting, demands who they are who 
discuss them as if they `still divided time by calends' -- a form 
of the question natural to souls living in a darkness unbroken by 
sun or moon into days and months.  Dante asks him to follow and 
he will hear, and the spirit promises to go as far as he is 
permitted -- that is, as it turns out to the edge of the smoke.  
The poet then tells him he is still in the flesh, `the swathing 
band which death unwindeth,' and that he had come hither through 
`the infernal anguish.'

	|40-49.~  Two questions he asks him -- first, who he was on earth;
and second, whether they were going in the right direction for the way
up, for even Virgil was uncertain.  He receives an answer which gives
rise to a long dissertation on the mystery of free-will (Villani [vii.
121] tells how Count Ugolino of Pisa, having showed this Marco the
magnificent preparations for his birthday feast, and asked his opinion
of them, received the reply: `You are better prepared for evil fortune
than any baron of Italy.'  When the Count asked why, Marco replied:
`Because there is nothing lacking save the anger of God' -- and this,
according to Villani, was not lacking long [see ^Inf.~ XXXII. 124ff.]):

 
       `A Lombard was I, and was called Marco; 
       The world I knew, and that worth I loved 
       At which has each one now unbent his bow. 
       For mounting upward thou art going right' -- 
 
for this soul can point the way it cannot yet go.  So little is 
known of this Marco that it is uncertain whether `Lombardo' 
indicates his nationality or his family name.  The probability is 
in favour of the former, though some of the early commentators 
speak of him as a member of the family of the Lombardi of Venice.  
His presence here implies that he was easily moved to anger, but 
otherwise he bears the name of having been a man of great 
learning, courtesy, and virtue.  Several stories are told of him 
which show that he had a witty and caustic tongue; and indeed his 
conversation here proves that it has not yet lost its edge. 

	|50-81.~  Meantime, evidently impressed by the Divine grace shown
to Dante, he begs for his prayers when he reaches Paradise.   The poet
promises, but begs him in turn to resolve a doubt with which he is
`bursting inwardly.'  It rose partly from Guido del Duca's 
words in the last Terrace about the degeneracy of Italy, and 
partly out of Marco's own statement that men no longer bent the 
bow to aim at virtue.  What Dante is so eager to know is the 
cause of this decay of morals,
 
       `For one in the heavens places it, another here below.' 
 
In other words, is the general worsening of the world a necessity 
imposed on it by the stars, or is it the result of man's own 
depravity?  The question tells Marco that Dante has indeed come 
from a blind world -- a world that seeks to excuse its evil by 
referring everything to a fatal necessity imposed on it by the 
stars.  (Compare Edmund's soliloquy in ^King Lear~ [Act i, Sc. 2]:
`This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in
fortune, -- often the surfeit of our own behaviour, -- we make guilty
our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains
by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and
treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers
by an enforced obedience of planetary indulgence; and all that we are
evil in, by a divine thrusting on.')  This, replies the Lombard, would
destroy free-will, and with it all moral responsibility; there would be
no justice 
 
     `In having joy for good, or grief for evil.' 
 
True, he says, the heavens initiate our movements, though not 
all.  This, indeed, is one of Dante's most fundamental 
conceptions.  He speaks of the nine spheres which circle round 
the earth as  
 
                    `the great wheels 
       Which direct every seed into some end, 
       According as the stars are its companions.'
                              (^Purg.~ XXX. 109-111.)
 
From his exposition of the spheres in the Second Canto of the 
^Paradiso~ and other passages, it is clear that Dante has no idea 
that the stars impose any fatal necessity upon man.  The nine 
spheres are conceived of simply as the means of transmission of 
Divine power, wisdom, and love to the human race.  Further, they 
do not transmit everything, -- the human soul comes direct from 
its Maker's hand.  But, says Marco, even if the heavens did 
initiate every movement, that would not determine irrevocably the 
whole after-course of human destiny.  Three things may alter it.  
In the first place, the light of reason and conscience to 
distinguish between good and evil; in the second place, freedom 
to choose one or other; and lastly, this freedom itself is 
subject `to a greater power and to a better nature' than that of 
the stars, and this subjection of our freedom to God creates in 
us a mind which the stars have not in their charge.
 
	|82-93.~  The cause, then, of the general corruption is not in the
heavens but in men themselves, and Marco proceeds to trace it 
specifically to the evil guidance of the Papacy.  He begins with 
a passage of great beauty descriptive of the innocent joy with 
which the human soul passes direct from God into the earthly 
life: 
 
       Forth from the hand of Him who with joy beholds it 
       Before it is, in fashion of a little maid 
       Weeping and laughing in her childish sport, 
       Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows, 
       Save that, set in motion by a joyous Maker, 
       Willingly it turns to that which gives it Pleasure.' 
 
Never, surely, was the doctrine of the human soul expressed with 
greater beauty.  It reminds us of Vaughan's `angell-infancy' with 
its `white celestiall thoughts,' and Wordsworth's 
 
          `trailing clouds of glory do we come 
       From God, who is our home.' 
 
The simple unknowing joy of the unborn soul is the joy of its 
Maker.  Before its creation it exists in the Divine idea, and 
there God contemplates it with delight.  When it passes forth 
from His hand into the earthly existence, His joy goes with it 
and makes it turn willingly to whatever gives it pleasure.  But 
in its childish ignorance it runs after every trivial and 
delusive good, the object of desire ever changing as life passes 
from stage to stage.  `Whence,' as he says in the ^Convito~, `we 
see little children desire above all things an apple; and then, 
proceeding further on, desire a little bird; and then, further 
on, desire a beautiful garment; and then a horse, and then a 
wife; and then riches, not great, then great, and then very 
great' (^Conv.~ iv. 12.  For the joy and happiness of God in Himself
and in all good, see Aquinas, ^Contra Gentiles~, Bk. i, chaps. 90, 100-
102.  The doctrine of the soul here advocated is that of Creationism
[its direct creation by the hand of God], against Traducianism [its
transmission by natural generation].  Dante follows Aquinas [^Summa~,
i, q. xc; ^Contra Gentiles~, ii. 87-89]: see ^Purg.~ XXV. 61-78; ^Par.~
VII. 142-144.) 
 
	|94-105.~  To restrain this foolish wandering of desire and lead
it home to its true end in God, two things are necessary: first, the 
bridle of laws, and second, a firm hand to hold the bridle, 
 
                    `a king who should discern 
       Of the true city at the least the tower,' -- 
 
the bulwarks of the eternal righteousness.  The bridle of laws 
did, indeed, exist, but there was no hand to hold it.  The reason 
given by Marco is a very curious one: 
 
               `Because the shepherd who precedes 
       Can chew the cud, but has not the hooves divided.' 
 
In other words, the Pope is an unclean animal, according to the 
Mosaic Law.  We have here a piece of pure mediaeval 
allegorizing.  `The dividing of the hoof,' says Aquinas, 
`signifies the distinction of the two testaments, or of Father 
and Son, or of the two natures in Christ, or the discrimination 
of goods and evil; but the chewing of the cud signifies 
meditation of the Scriptures and the sound understanding of 
them' (Lev. xi. 3; ^Summa~, i-ii, q. cii, a. 6).  Dante, however, has
his own interpretation of the cloven hoof.  The Pope -- who, we must
remember, was Boniface VIII. -- could indeed chew the cud of meditation
upon the Scriptures; but in the cleaving of the hoof he failed in two
directions.  First, in the practice of morals; for according to St.
Augustine the doing of right is like the animal's cloven hoof, it has
a better hold of the ground and prevents slipping and falling.  It is
the evil guidance of the Papacy which has 
corrupted the world: when the people see their shepherd aiming at 
what they hunger for themselves, `they feed on that, and ask no 
further.'

	|106-114.~  In the second place, the Pope refused to divide the 
hoof by distinguishing between the temporal and spiritual powers, 
and assigning to each its sphere, as in the better days of old: 
 
       `Rome, that made the world good, was wont 
       Two suns to have, which one road and the other, 
       Of the world and of God, made plain to sight. 
       The one the other has quenched, and the sword is joined 
       With the crook; and the one together with the other 
       Of sheer necessity must needs go ill; 
       Because, being joined, one feareth not the other. 
       If thou believe me not, consider well the ear, 
       For every herb is known by the seed.'
 
This is Dante's political creed which he reasons out in the ~De 
Monarchia~, and especially in Book III., the argument of which is 
that the authority of the Emperor is derived immediately from God 
and not from His Vicar, as the Pope held.  The Papal claim to the 
temporal power was a comparatively modern usurpation.  In the 
earlier and better times, Rome was illuminated by two suns -- the 
Emperor, shining on the pathway of the present life and world, 
and the Pope, the appointed guide to eternal blessedness in God.  
`Therefore,' says the ^De Monarchia~, `man had need of two guides 
for his life, as he had a twofold end in life; whereof one is the 
Supreme Pontiff, to lead mankind to eternal life according to the 
things revealed to us; and the other is the Emperor, to guide 
mankind to happiness in this world in accordance with the 
teaching of philosophy' (^De Mon.~ iii. 16).  In the figure of the two
suns, however, Dante goes a step beyond the position he held in his
political treatise.  There he did not challenge the well-known 
comparison of the two powers to the sun and moon; he did not even 
deny that the Emperor is the lesser light, deriving part of his 
illumination from the greater.  What he does deny is that the 
moon is dependent on the sun for its being, its power, or its 
operation.  `Its motion comes from its proper mover, its 
influence is from its own rays.  For it has a certain light of its 
own, which is manifest at the time of an eclipse; though for its 
better and more powerful working it receives from the sun an 
abundant light, which enables it to work more powerfully.  
Therefore I say that the temporal power does not receive its 
being from the spiritual power, nor its power which is its 
authority, nor its working considered in itself.  Yet it is good 
that the temporal power should receive from the spiritual the 
means of working more effectively by the light of the grace which 
the benediction of the Supreme Pontiff bestows on it both in 
heaven and on earth....  Let, therefore, Caesar be reverent to 
Peter, as the first-born son should be reverent to his father, 
that he may be illuminated by his father's grace, and so may be 
stronger to lighten the world over which he has been placed by 
Him alone, who is the ruler of all things spiritual as well as 
temporal' (^De Mon.~ iii. 4, 16 [Church]).  In the present Canto this
qualified superiority of the Papacy appears to be repudiated: the two
powers are `two suns,' each supreme in its own sphere (see ^Epis.~ vii.
2, where Henry VII. is called `our sun').  When this independence is
not respected, and the sword joined to the crozier, `one feareth not
the other,' and the necessary check is removed.  The Pope should be
restained by the civil power in civil matters; the 
Emperor by the spiritual power in things spiritual; and when the 
two powers are in one hand, the result is disastrous.  (For a
discussion of the Papal claim to possess the `two swords' of Luke xxii.
38 -- the temporal and spiritual powers -- see ^De Mon.~ iii. 9, a
chapter which shows, as Wicksteed says, `how entirely he [Dante] was of
sweeping away allegorical subtleties and taking the plain sense of the
text when it suited him.')

	|115-126.~  In proof Marco points to the moral degradation of
Lombardy and upper Italy in general, brought about by the long struggle
between Frederick II. and the Papacy.  In all the territory 
between the Adige and the Po, only three good men are left, to 
long for the time when God will restore them to the better life: 
 
       `Corrado da Palazzo, and the good Gherardo, 
       And Guido da Castel, who is better named, 
       In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard.'

(Toynbee is probably right in thinking that `the simple Lombard' has
some special significance.  In French `Lombart' meant ^usurer~ --
compare our `Lombard Street,' and the `Rue des Lombards' in Paris.  
According to the ^Ottimo Commento~, this Guido da Castel was most
hospitable to travellers to and from France, aiding them freely with
`horses, arms, and money.'  This was a new kind of usurer, and his
French friends may have called him playfully `the simple Lombard'
[^Dante Studies and Researches~, p.265].)
 
	|127-132.~  Marco finishes his long speech by declaring that this
deplorable state of things springs from the refusal of the Papacy to
divide the hoof, to recognize the separate jurisdictions of the two
powers: the undivided hoof can take no firm grip of the ground, and,
like an unclean animal, the Church falls into the mire with its double
burden of the two governments which it has confounded.  `And now,' says
Dante, 
 
               discern I why from the heritage 
       The sons of Levi were excluded -- 
 
that they might not be drawn away by the possessions of the world 
from the performance of their spiritual duties.  More than once 
Dante denounces the `Donation of Constantine' as the beginning of 
the Church's lapse into worldliness and ambition.  Even if 
Constantine had the right -- which Dante denies -- to give the 
lands and temporal power of the West to the Church, `the Vicar of 
God could receive such things, not to possess them, but as a 
steward to dispense the fruits of them to the poor of Christ, on 
behalf of the Church, as we know the Apostles did' (Numb. xviii, 23,
24; ^De Mon.~ iii. 10, 14; see ^Purg.~ XXXII. 124-129 {and comm.}).  
Whatever view we take of Dante's political creed, the character and 
conduct of Boniface VIII. justify to the full his denunciation of 
the union of the sword and crozier for which this utterly worldly 
Pontiff fought with an ambition almost insane and wholly unscrupulous. 
His angry exclamation to the envoys of the Emperor Albert, `I, I am the
Emperor!' has been already quoted.  Priestly arrogance can scarcely go
further than his declaration in his Bull ^Unam Sanctam~, that
subjection to the Roman Pontiff is necessary for salvation.  The
consequences of this `confounding of two 
governments' were disastrous, as Dante here foretells.  To use 
his figure, the undivided hoof brought the unclean animal and its 
burden to the ground, and covered it with shame and mire.  The 
outrage at Anagni and the Babylonish captivity at Avignon, were 
the natural fruits of the wordliness and ambition of `the great-hearted
sinner,' as he has been called; and his tomb, as 
Gregorovius says, is `the gravestone of the mediaeval Papacy, 
which was buried with him by the forces of the age' (^Rome in the
Middle Ages~, v. 597 [English Translation]).
 
At this point, Marco Lombardo bids the poets farewell -- 
`God be with you.'  He can go no further, for he has reached the 
edge of the smoke, and through the mist he sees the dim light of
`dawn' -- the shining of the Angel of the Terrace.  He is not yet 
so purified of the darkness of Anger that his eyes can bear the 
light of his gentle and holy face: he sees him only as a vague 
whiteness.  Dante, it appears, is not yet able to see even this.
