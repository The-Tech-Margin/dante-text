	|1-6.~  It is somewhere about this point that the three
Pilgrims must have met the Angel of the Terrace, although, strange to
say, there is no mention of the encounter until it is past, nor is
there any description of the Angel, as on most of the other 
Cornices.  Dante seems not to have seen him at all; he was 
conscious only of his turning them into the passage which led up 
to the Sixth Terrace, and of erasing the fifth P from his brow. 
This cannot be accidental, and the reason seems to depend on what 
the Angel represents.  From the Beatitude with which he greets 
the travellers, we may assume that he is the Angel of Justice: 
 
       And those who have to justice their desire 
       He had said to us are ^Beati~, and his words 
       With ^sitiunt~, without the rest, set forth. (Matt. v. 6.)
 
In the Vulgate the full Beatitude is: `^Beati qui esuriunt et 
sitiunt justitiam.~'  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst 
after righteousness' or justice.  Dante breaks this up into two 
Beatitudes -- the ^thirst~ for justice relating to this Terrace 
of Avarice, and the ^hunger~ to the Terrace of Gluttony 
immediately above.  The Beatitude here, therefore, is, `Blessed 
are they who thirst for justice' -- the thirst for justice 
standing in opposition to the thirst for gold.  The Angel, then, 
represents Justice; and Justice is defined by Aquinas as `a 
habit, whereby with a standing and abiding will one gives every 
one his due.'  Properly speaking, however, Justice as thus 
defined is not the exact opposite of Avarice, which is `an 
immoderate love of having.'  It is quite conceivable that a man 
may be strictly just in the payment of his legal debts, and yet 
be a slave to the love of money, nay, may even pursue honesty as the 
best policy, the surest safest mode of gratifying that love.  Hence
Aquinas sees that something over and above justice is necessary to
moderate the `interior affections' in relation to riches; and this
something is liberality.  For this reason when he discusses avarice
and prodigality, it is as vices opposed not to justice but to
liberality, though he admits that there is an intimate agreement
between the two (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. lviii, a. 1; cxvii. 5; cxviii. 3. 
`Liberality,' says Aquinas, `is not a species of justice: because
justice renders to another what is his, but liberality gives him what
is the giver's own.  Still it has a certain agreement with justice on
two points: first, that it is ^to another~, as justice also is;
secondly, that it is about exterior things, like justice, though in
another way.  And therefore liberality is laid down by some to be a
part of justice, as a virtue annexed to justice as its primary').  It
comes nearer Dante's purpose, then, to say that the Angel represents
Liberality, the Aristotelian mean between Prodigality and Avarice
(^Ethics~, iv. 1-3).  This would account too for the curiously
incidental way in which he is named by Dante.  No account is given of
the meeting with him, or of his appearance.  He is not even mentioned
until he has been left behind.  Liberality is a modest virtue which
does nothing to be seen of men; it obeys the command, `Let not thy
left hand know what thy right hand doeth' (Matt. vi. 3.  In ^Summa~
ii-ii, q. cxxxii, a. 5, ostentation in alms-giving is condemned as
lacking in charity, since it is the preferring of a man's own
vainglory to the good of his neighbor).
 
	|7-9.~  With the wiping away of the P of Covetousness from his
brow, Dante tells us he found himself `more light than through the 
other passes.'  He regards the love of money as one of the 
heaviest of all the burdens of sin: it keeps its victims in the 
Fourth Circle of the Inferno rolling great weights `by main-force 
of chest'; it holds these penitents prostrate on the dust to 
which their souls cleave; and some forms of it, such as Simony, 
bury men alive in the hard rock of their own pitiless hearts.  None
of the P's erased from his brow on the other Terraces -- not 
even that of Pride -- gave him the same sense of lightness, of 
emancipation from the burden and bondage of the world. 
 
	|10-24.~  Meantime the conversation between the two Latin poets 
proceeds as they climb up the passage to the Sixth Cornice (Virgil
tells Statius that even in Limbo he had heard from Juvenal of his
love for him.  Juvenal was a contemporary of Statius whom he praises
in ^Satire~ vii.  Dante refers to him in ^Conv.~ iv. 12 as one who
denounced `the deceitfulness of riches').  Virgil cannot understand
how a wise man like Statius, and one who had so diligently cultivated
wisdom, could have become the victim of so low a vice as avarice, and
begs him to tell him how it came about. 

	|34-48.~  The question moves Statius to laughter for a moment
{vv. 25-26}, and he then explains that his sin had been prodigality,
`the direct opposite' of avarice.  Moreover, it was Virgil himself
who had taught him what he did not know before -- that prodigality is
a sin (`The woeful jousts' of l. 42 refers to the clashing of the
Prodigals and Misers in ^Inf.~ vii. 22-35): 
 
       `Now know thou that avarice was parted 
       Too far from me, and this disproportion 
       Thousands of moons have punished. 
       And were it not that I set straight my care, 
       When I understood the passage where thou criest, 
       Enraged as it were `gainst human nature: 
       "By what dost thou not sway, O cursed hunger 
       Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?" -- 
       At the rolling I should feel the woeful jousts. 
       Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide 
       Their wings in spending and repented me 
       As well of that as of my other sins; 
       How many shall rise again with the hair shorn, 
       Because of ignorance, which from this sin cuts off 
       Repentance during life, and in the lastest hour!' 
 
In other words multitudes recognize avarice as a deadly sin, never
suspect that prodigality is the other extreme of the self-same vice,
both being love of money -- the one to hoard, the other to spend. 
The reason of this ignorance is, as Aristotle says, that prodigality,
being an excess of ^giving~, is akin to liberality, and frequently
believes itself to be that virtue.  Its very open-handedness gives it
a look of generosity which conceals its inherent meanness and evil. 
`Most prodigals,' writes Aristole, `not only give to the wrong people
but take from the wrong sources, and are so far illiberal.  They
become grasping because they are eager to spend, and are not able to
do so easily, as their means soon run short; they are therefore 
obliged to get their means from other sources.  At the same time, 
as nobleness is a matter of indifference to them, they are 
reckless and indiscriminate in their taking; for they are eager 
to give but do not care at all how they give, or how they get the 
means of giving' (^Ethics~, iv. 3 [Welldon].  Comp. ^Conv.~ iv. 27:
`Ah ye ill-starred and ill-born, who disinherit widows and wards, who
snatch from the most helpless, who rob and seize the rights of
others, and therefrom prepare feasts, make gifts of horses and arms,
robes and money, wear gorgeous apparel, build marvellous edifices,
and believe yourselves to be doing generously!  And what else is this
than to take the cloth from the altar and cover therewith the robber
and his table?' [Wicksteed's Translation]).  Ignorant of this
inherent sinfulness, many prodigals live and die without repentance,
and will therefore rise, says Statius, `with the hair shorn,' in
reference to the Italian proverb which describes a spendthrift as one
who `squanders to his very hair.'  In the Resurrection even their 
bodies will bear the marks of their prodigal career. 

It is this ignorance of the sinfulness of Prodigality 
which gives the key to the sense in which Statius quotes Virgil's 
famous apostrophe to `auri sacra fames,' over which so much 
controversy has raged.  To justify the translation given above, 
and to bring out what we regard as the true sense, it is 
necessary to examine the passage with some care. 
 
(1) The lines to which Statius refers are ^AEneid~, iii.  
56, 57: 
 
               `Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, 
       Auri sacra fames?'

(Dante's version, according to the Oxford edition, is as follows:

          `Per che non reggi tu, o sacra fame
          Dell'oro, l'appetito dei mortali?')
 
`To what dost thou not drive the hearts of mortals, accursed 
hunger of gold?'  There can be little doubt that `sacra' means 
`accursed,' and not `sacred,' as Dryden, for example translates 
it.  If ever this hunger was accursed, it was when it drove to 
the crime which wrung the cry from AEneas.  The infamy of 
Polymnestor, who murdered young Polydorus his guest for the sake 
of his treasure, encircles the Mount on the Terrace of Avarice.  
It is, therefore, most improbable that Dante completely reverses 
what he must have known perfectly to be the Virgilian sense. 
 
(2) This decides the rejection of a common translation of 
Dante's rendering: `Why restrainest thou not, O holy hunger of 
gold, the desire of mortals?' -- based partly on the ambiguity 
of the word ^sacra~, and partly on his substitution of the word 
^cogis.~  The idea of this translation is that the hunger for 
gold, being a natural human appetite, is holy, if held within due 
bounds.  If Dante really thought this was the meaning of Virgil's 
words, there are three ways in which we can account for it.  
First, by sheer ignorance; and whoever can believe that Dante did 
not understand an ordinary piece of Latin like this, is capable 
of believing anything.  It would certainly constitute, as Dr. 
Oelsner says, `a more portentous blunder in Latinity than any 
other that can be brought home to him.'  The second possibility is 
more likely -- that he quoted from memory, and that his memory 
misled him.  There is a third, however, which fits in much more 
naturally with all we know of the working of his mind, namely, 
that `Dante, while understanding the sense in which Virgil 
uttered the words, considered himself justified in supposing that 
his writings, like the Scripture, had many senses, and that for 
purposes of edification we must look at all the possible meanings 
that any passage might have apart from the context in which it 
occurs' (^Purgatorio~, Temple Classics, p. 280). 
 
(3) On this supposition, what is the special meaning 
which he finds here in Virgil's words, as a legitimate extension 
and application of their original sense?  The answer is surely to 
be sought in the discovery which Statius found in them of the 
sinfulness of prodigality.  He knew that the `accursed hunger of 
gold' drove men to crime by ^means of avarice^; but he did not 
know that the same evil hunger swayed the appetite of men equally 
by ^means of prodigality.~  It came on him as a sudden revelation 
that this hunger of gold can approach by the most opposite 
avenues, can rule over us through the most diverse passions.  To 
paraphrase the passage as given by Dante: `By means of what art 
thou not able to rule human hearts?  Thou canst do it by avarice, 
the passion for hoarding; not less canst thou do it by its 
opposite, prodigality, the passion for spending.  By what canst 
thou ^not~ do it?  What instrument is there thou canst not use to 
sway the appetite of mortal men?'  This interpretation has at 
least the merit of flowing out of the great discovery which 
Statius says he found in the words, of the sinfulness of his own 
spendthrift life.  The interpretation preferred by Scartazzini 
and others: `Through what crooked ways, through what wickedness, 
dost thou not lead and guide, O accursed hunger of gold, the 
appetite of men?' -- is too vague and general.  It has nothing 
specially to do with the case in point: Statius knew already that 
this hunger drove the avaricious man through `crooked ways' of 
wickedness; what he had still to learn was that it was the same 
unholy hunger that swayed his own prodigal soul (this interpretation
is based on Dr. Moore's reading ^per che~, instead of ^perch@e~; ^a
che~, which Butler accepts, he regards as simply `an alteration of
the text.'  Butler's idea that `Dante understood "sacra fames" in a
good sense, equivalent to the "holy poverty" of theologians,' even if
true, would have no bearing on the case of Statius.  Dr. Moore seems
inclined to regard the passage as `a sort of misquotation by Dante'
[^Studies in Dante~, 1st Series, p. 186].  It may seem presumptuous
to differ from so many Dante scholars of the first rank, but one has
little option: the meaning must be sought by putting one's self in
the place of Statius, and seeing clearly what discovery of moral
truth Virgil's words conveyed to him). 
 
	|55-63.~  Virgil now proceeds to a second difficulty.  None but 
Christians can purge themselves upon this Mountain: how, then was 
Statius here, seeing that at the time when he sang `the cruel war 
of the twofold sorrow of Jocasta' in the ^Thebaid~, he was still 
a Pagan?  What sun or candles dispelled his heathen darkness, he 
asks, so that he set his sails behind the Fisherman, that is, St. 
Peter?  (It is curious to find Virgil conversant with the contents of
a poem written after his death, even to the opening invocation to
Clio, the Muse of History [l. 58].  Did he learn it from Juvenal, who
told him in Limbo of the affection which Statius bore him [ll. 13-
15]?  `The twofold sorrow of Jocasta' refers to her twin sons,
Polynices and Eteocles, possibly with a side glance at their
incestuous birth.  Their hatred survived death [^Inf.~ xxvi. 54].)

	|64-93.~  The answer shows the hopeless entanglement in which 
the Church's doctrine of the perdition of the heathen involved 
the poet's mind, and the pathos of the strange doom by which 
Virgil, able to `save others,' as Dr. Moore says, cannot `save 
himself.'  The passage is important for the understanding of the 
relations between Faith and Reason, Christianity and Paganism: 
 
               `Thou first didst put me on the way 
       Towards Parnassus, in its caves to drink, 
       And then didst light me on the road to God. 
       Thou didst as he who walketh in the night, 
       Who bears the light behind, and helpeth not himself, 
       But maketh wise the persons after him, 
       When thou didst say: "The world renews itself, 
       Justice returns, and man's primeval time, 
       And a new progeny from Heaven descends." 
       Through thee I poet was, through thee a Christian; 
       But that thou better see what I outline, 
       To fill with colour I will stretch the hand. 
       Already was the world in every part 
       Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated 
       By the messengers of the Eternal Kingdom; 
       And the word of thine, touched on above, 
       With the new preachers was in harmony, 
       Whence I to visit them the habit took. 
       They then came to seem to me so holy, 
       That, when Domitian persecuted them, 
       Not without tears of mine were their laments.
       And so long as in yonder world I stayed, 
       Them I befriended, and their upright customs 
       Made me hold cheap all other sects; 
       And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers 
       Of Thebes, in my poem, had I baptism: 
       But through fear a hidden Christian was I, 
       Long time making a show of paganism; 
       And this lukewarmth made me the fourth circle 
       Circle round, more than four hundred years.'

(The curious reference in ll. 88, 89 to the date of his baptism has
undoubtedly some meaning, but it is difficult to say what.  It is in
the ninth of the twelve books of the ^Thebaid~ that Statius brings 
the Greeks to the rivers of Thebes, Ismenus and Asopus.  `His luke-
warmness,' says Vernon, `would be shown by there being no profession
of his faith, or praise of the Christian religion, in his three last
books.')

There is no record whatever of the conversion of Statius: it is a 
pure invention, for the purpose, apparently, of showing that 
Christ is `the Desire of all nations' (Haggai ii. 7), and that the
natural heart grows prophetic in its yearning for His advent.  The 
passage quoted is the well-known `Cumaean song' of the last age: 
 
       Magnus ab integro secl#orum nascitur ordo 
       Jam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna: 
       Jam nova progenies coelo demittitur alto. 
 
The Fourth Eclogue of the ^Bucolics~ {vv. 4-6} from which these words
come, has just that atmosphere of prophetic mystery which would 
naturally attract a mind like Dante's.  `It is allegorical, 
mystical, half historical and prophetical, aenigmatical, 
anything in fact but Bucolic.'  From its title ^Pollio~, the 
words quoted above are thought by many to refer to the birth of 
the son of Virgil's patron, Asinius Pollio, governor of Northern 
Italy.  Others refer them to the birth of Marcellus, son of 
Octavia, the sister of Augustus, for whose early death Virgil 
wrote the great dirge in the Sixth of the ^AEneid~ (860-886).  
`The main purpose of the poem, however,' as Professor Sellar says 
`is to express, in connexion with pastoral associations, the 
longing of the world for a new era of peace and happiness, of 
which the treaty of Brundusium seemed to hold out some definite 
hopes....  The ideas are derived partly from Greek representations 
of the Golden Age, and partly, it is supposed, from the later 
Sibylline prophecies, circulated after the burning in the time of 
Sulla of the old Sibylline books, and possibly tinged with Jewish 
ideas' (Art. `Virgil' in ^Encycl. Brit.~ [Tenth Ed.]).  It is for
this reason, apparently, that the poem rose naturally to Dante's mind
as he drew near the Earthly Paradise, which, as we shall see, he
regarded as the fulfilment of poets' dreams of the Golden Age
(^Purg.~ xxviii. 139-141.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 28.139-147}).  The
words to which Dante refers were too alluring and suggestive to be
passed over by the Christian Church.  Its apologists seized on them
eagerly as a prophecy of the birth of Christ, and Virgil was elevated
to the rank of `a species of Pagan Isaiah.'  `He was placed among the
Prophets in the Cathedral of Zamorra, and invoked as Prophet of 
the Gentiles in Limoges and Rheims.  The rubric of Rouen (Professor
Tyrrell's ^Latin Poetry~, p. 156) directed that on Christmas Day the
priest should say, -- 
 
               "Maro, Maro, Vates Gentilium 
                 Da Christo testimonium," 
 
to which Virgilius was to reply, 
 
       "Ecce polo demissa solo nova progenies est."'
 
The beautiful story of the Sibyl appearing to Virgil's patron, 
the Emperor Augustus, and giving him a vision of the Virgin and 
Child, as she herself takes her departure from the world, may be 
regarded as this Virgilian passage turned by the pious 
imagination of the Church into pictorial legendary form (see Mrs.
Jameson's ^Legends of the Madonna~, p. 197).  Dante's chief interest
in the words is that they linked together the old world and the new,
forming what he regarded as a natural point of transition from
Paganism to Christianity. 

In short, Virgil is the Pagan John the Baptist, and, like 
his fellow-herald, `the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater 
than he.'  For undoubtedly Statius is a lesser soul, yet Virgil 
is pictured as a mere servant walking at night in front of him, 
and holding a lamp behind to guide his master's footsteps, while 
he himself remains in the darkness.  Dante must surely have felt 
the strange anomaly which this involves.  It is not as if the 
Christianity of Statius were of a high and noble quality; on the 
contrary, it was lukewarm and cowardly.  True, he befriended the 
Christians, and sympathized with them even to tears in their 
persecutions; but he refused to share their sufferings, and 
remained a `hidden Christian,' `making a show of Paganism.'  For 
this cowardly shrinking from `witnessing a good confession,' he 
has to pay by a penance of full four hundred years on the Terrace 
of Sloth (for the importance of confession in Scripture, see Matt. x.
32, 33; Rom. x. 9, 10; 1 Tim. vi. 13).  It is far from being a noble
type of Christian character; and while, indeed, Dante intends the
passage to show the superiority of the Christian faith, it is surely
more than questionable whether it is really honoured when a man such
as Dante conceived Virgil to be, is made a mere servant to light a 
coward soul to Paradise, only to be himself swept down to 
darkness and the Limbo of Hell.  Dante's tears when he found his 
`sweetest Father' vanished from his side, prove that he never 
quite reconciled himself to the perdition of virtuous heathen: as 
a faithful son of the Church he might accept it, but he felt that 
it violated some instinct of both love and justice in the human 
heart (according to Professor Earle, this conversion of Statius `was
not a solitary case, but an example of Virgil's influence, and it
certainly must be understood to shed a reflex light upon the destiny
of Virgil himself.'  In other words, having saved others, he must
himself be saved [Introduction to Dr. Shadwell's Translation of the
^Purgatorio~, Part II, pp. lxi-lxvii]; against this see {comm. to
^Purg.~ 30.49-54}). 

It is difficult to understand how Statius spent about 
one-fourth of the twelve centuries or so that had elapsed since 
his death in A.D. 96.  If we add this number to the 400 years on 
the Terrace of Sloth, and the 500 on that of Avarice (^Purg.~ xxi.
67-68; xxii. 92-93; the numbers are only approximate), we have 
996, leaving 304 to make up 1300, the ideal date of the poem.  It 
is generally assumed that those three centuries were spent in 
Ante-Purgatory; but the question, in what part, is not easy to 
answer.  Indeed, the only possible part seems to be the very base 
of the Mountain among the Excommunicate.  The three remaining 
classes are ruled out, for their period of detention does not 
exceed the length of time they postponed repentance on earth.  The 
Excommunicate, on the other hand, are detained thirty times the 
period of their contumacy.  If we imagine that Dante regarded the 
non-confession of Statius as a species of self-excommunication, 
the 300 years would be the thirtyfold detention for ten years of 
contumacy against the Church.  The question is not important, but 
it is unlike Dante to leave matters of either time or space at 
loose ends; and merely to say that the three centuries 
unaccounted for were passed in Ante-Purgatory only creates a new 
difficulty. 
 
	|94-114.~  The remainder of the ascent is occupied with
conversation about certain Latin and Greek poets, and the personages
who appear in the ^Thebaid~ and ^Achilleid~ of Statius.  Terence, 
Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, Persius, and many others, himself 
included, says Virgil, are in Limbo with Homer, `that Greek whom 
the Muses suckled more than ever another' where they hold 
discourse of `the mountain which had their nurses always with 
itself.'  There too are the Greek poets Euripides and Antiphon, 
Simonides, Agathon and many more.  Finally, `the fellow-craftsman's
sympathy' makes Virgil tell his brother-poet the doom of `his
people,' the women who moved in tragic sorrow through his pages: 
 
       `Antigone Deiphyl,e and Argia, 
       And there Ismene, mournful as of old. 
       There is she seen who pointed out Langia; 
       There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis, 
       And Deidamia with her sisters.'

(Ismene, daughter of Oedipus, is still saddened by the memory of the
tragedies through which she passed on earth: `the violent death of
her betrothed, the blinding of her father Oedipus by his own hand,
the suicide of her mother Jocasta, the deaths at each other's hands
of her brother Eteocles and Polynices, and the total ruin and
downfall of her father's kingdom' [Toynbee].  `She who pointed out
Langia' is Hypsipyl,e.  While she was in charge of the son of
Lycurgus, King of Nemea, the seven heroes on their way to fight
against Thebes asked her where there was a fountain.  Leaving the
child, she pointed out to them the fountain of Langia; and on
returning found the boy dead from the bite of a serpent.  Her rescue
by her sons from the death to which Lycurgus had doomed her, is
referred to in Canto xxvi. 94-95.  `The daughter of Tiresias' is
Manto, but it seems impossible to reconcile Virgil's assertion here
that she is in Limbo with the fact that she is in the Bolgia of
Diviners in the Eighth Circle [^Inf.~ xx. 52 ff.].  Toynbee calls it
`an unique instance of inaccuracy on Dante's part in a matter of this
kind.')
 
They have ceased to be mere ^dramatis personae~: the tragedy of 
earth has swept out into the greater tragedy of the eternal 
world; yet to Virgil's mind that quiet land where `only sighs 
made tremulous the eternal air' may well have seemed a very haven 
of peace from the wild storms of human sin and passion which beat 
upon them here. 

The introduction of Statius as a supplementary guide to 
Virgil is one of the most difficult things in the poem.  Dr. 
Moore's suggestion cannot be far from Dante's general purpose: 
`If Virgil (as is generally admitted) represents Human Reason, 
and Beatrice Revelation or Theology, we may perhaps suppose that 
Statius typifies something intermediate; such as Human Reason, 
generally enlightened by Christanity, but not specially 
instructed or interested therein; the cultivated "lay" mind (not 
even the "pious layman") in an age that has received the general 
impress of Christianity; a mind by which it is accepted and 
assumed rather than warmly embraced; one that is unconsciously 
rather than consciously under its influence.  Christainty has, of 
course, lifted the minds, the ideas, the knowledge of mankind to 
a different level, though they may not be aware of what precisely 
they owe to it.  They breathe a different atmosphere, though they 
may be unconscious of its ingredients, and unaware of the degree or 
manner in which it has been changed for the better' (^Studies in
Dante~, 1st Series, p. 33).  We may perhaps make this view a little
more definite if we say that Statius represents something
intermediate between Virgil as Reason and Matelda as symbol of the
Active Life; for, when Earthly Paradise is reached, Virgil and
Statius retire into the background, and Matelda becomes the guide to
Beatrice.  Statius, then, may represent a semi-Christianized
Philosophy, able indeed to expound the mystery of the human soul in
its relation to the natural body of earth and aerial body of
Purgatory, but not yet capable of the positive obedience and service
of the Active Life.  Doubtless he is chosen for this intermediate
office because his warm admiration of Virgil made him an easy point
of transition from the virtues of natural Reason to that higher form
of them represented by Matelda. 
 
	|124-126.~  It was after ten o'clock when the three Pilgrims
emerged from the ascent and found themselves on the Sixth Terrace,
where the souls of the Gluttonous purged themselves of their special 
vice.  Virgil has no hesitation about the direction now: custom 
is his guide, and he at once turns to the right, with the greater 
confidence that Statius assented.  The two great Latin poets walk 
in front discoursing of their art, while Dante follows listening 
reverently to his Masters' words.

	|127-129.~  It is perhaps in the light of some such view as this
that we are to understand another difficulty, namely, the changes in 
the order in which the three Pilgrims pursue their journey.  This 
order, as we shall see, passes through three changes.  In the 
first place, up to the point where they enter the fire which 
burns away Sensuality on the last Terrace, Virgil and Statius 
walk in front and Dante alone behind.  This indicates partly Dante's
great reverence for them as his masters in poetry, for he expressly
says he `was listening to their discourse which gave him intellect to
sing.'  But, since this same order seems to be preserved afterwards
when Statius explains the genesis of the natural and Purgatorial
bodies, it is obvious that Dante follows him as the exponent of the
Philosophy which forms the transition from the natural world to the
spiritual.  When they enter the fire which burns out Sensuality, this
order is changed, and changed so deliberately, that some symbolism is
obviously intended (xxvii. 46-48).  Virgil goes in front, and 
asks Statius to bring up the rear, with Dante between the two.  
It is far from easy to understand the reason for this order but 
one may hazard a conjecture.  It was not Dante's Christian faith 
which led him to purifying fire, but his reason which urged him 
again and again to the painful discipline.  But while his 
Christianity cannot lead him into the flame, it can guard him in 
the rear, and keep him from trying to run away from the torture.  
Once through the fire, a third change takes place.  When Matelda 
is reached, Dante walks in front and his former guides behind 
(xxviii. 82; 145, 146).  He has entered upon the practical work 
of the Active Life, a stage of Christian experience surpassing 
the mere natural Reason of Virgil and the half-Christianized 
Philosophy of Statius.  In short, the changes in the relative 
positions of the three Pilgrims seem to represent various stages 
through which Dante passed before his Active Life was fully 
Christianized. 

One final difficulty.  It cannot but strike us as strange 
that, while Reason in the person of Virgil is sufficient to lead 
Dante through the more spiritual sins of Pride, Envy, Anger, and 
Sloth, for the sins of the flesh, Avarice, Gluttony, Sensuality, 
the more distinctively Christian power, represented by Statius, 
is necessary.  This plainly implies that the latter are more 
difficult to overcome, that Reason requires the aid of a more 
spiritual strength.  If one may conjecture once more, may the 
solution not lie in the very fact that Avarice, Gluttony, and 
Sensuality have a certain natural basis in the flesh?  They are 
sins of a natural appetite in excess, and it is this natural 
element which makes it more difficult for Reason to control them, 
-- it carries them easily beyond the bounds of Reason.  Hence 
perhaps Statius is joined with Virgil, a more spiritual element 
with the rational, in fulfilment of St. Paul's injunction: `Walk 
in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh' (Gal.
v. 16). 

	|130-141.~  Suddenly `the sweet converse' is interrupted by a
tree growing in the midst of the path `with fruit pleasant and good
to smell': 
 
     And even as a fir-tree tapers upward 
     From bough to bough, so downwardly did that: 
     I think in order that no one up may go. 
     On the side on which our path was closed, 
     Fell from the high rock a limpid water, 
     And spread itself abroad upon the leaves 
     The two poets to the tree drew near, 
     And from within the foliage a voice 
     Cried: `Of this food ye shall have scarcity.' 

	|142-154.~  The same voice then proclaimed the great examples of
Temperance which form the `whip' to urge on the penitents of this
Terrace in pursuit of that virtue.  The first, as usual, is from the
Virgin's life: thinking more of the honour of the marriage-feast at
Cana than of her own mouth, that mouth gained the power to `respond'
for men -- prayer and intercession being possible only to the
temperate.  The heathen parallel to Mary is the ancient Roman women
who were content with water for their drink (according to Aquinas
[^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxlix, a. 4], `sobriety is especially required in
young men and in women,' because of their proneness to certain sins. 
`Hence, according to Valerius Maximus, among the ancient Romans women
used not to drink wine.').  Then follows an example of abstinence
from the Old Testament, Daniel who held food cheap, and thereby
gained wisdom, for temperance clears the brain as gluttony clogs and
blinds it (Dan. i. 8, 17).  The Golden Age is next proclaimed when
hunger made acorns savoury, and thirst turned every brook into
nectar.  And finally, John the Baptist is praised, the herald of the
new Golden Age of Christianity, whose simple desert food of `honey
and locusts' made him glorious and great (Matt. iii. 4; xi. 
11).  There is probably a side glance at the luxury of the city of 
Florence of which he was the patron saint, and a hint that she would 
never become great and glorious till she gained his virtue of
temperate living. 

In order to identify, if possible, this first tree, it 
will be well to examine the other `plant' which the poets see as 
they near the end of their journey on the Terrace.  Dante 
describes it thus: 
 
     Appeared to me the boughs laden and living 
     Of another apple-tree, not far distant, 
     Since I had but then turned thitherward. 
     I saw people beneath it raise their hands, 
     And cry I know not what toward the leaves, 
     Like little children eager and disappointed, 
     Who pray, and he they pray to answers not, 
     But to make their wish be very keen 
     Holds their desire on high, and hides it not. 
     Then they departed, as if undeceived; 
     And now we came unto the great tree 
     Which so many prayers and tears refuses. 
     `Pass farther onward without drawing nigh; 
     The tree is higher up of which Eve ate, 
     And out of it this plant was raised.' 
                         (^Purg.~ xxiv. 103-117.)
 
This is obviously the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil; and the
reference to Eve is in substance the first of the examples of 
Intemperance which forms the `bridle' of this Terrace.  It stands 
over against the Virgin's temperance at the marriage-feast, -- 
the great world-wide ruin caused by the indulgence of a natural 
appetite.  The two other examples show the danger of intemperance 
in wine and in water.  The first are the Centaurs: 
 
     Be mindful,' said he, `of the accursed ones 
     Formed of the cloud-rack, who, when gorged, 
     Fought against Theseus with their double breasts.' 
                         (^Purg.~ xxiv. 121-123.) 
 
The reference is to the attempt of the Centaurs, when heated with 
wine at the marriage of their half-brother, Pirithous, King of the
Lapithae, to carry off the bride and the other women.  Theseus and
the Lapithae defeated them after a severe conflict.  They are the
type in the ^Commedia~ of violence and riotous excess.  `Their double
breasts' refers to their twofold form, half-horse, half-man, with a
special allusion in the present connection to the way in which
drunkenness turns a man into a brute; while `formed of the cloudrack'
relates to the treacherous passion of their father Ixion, of which
they were the fruit.  The next example is from Scripture, and
represents the necessity of abstaining at times even from excess in
water: Gideon's rejection of the men who `bowed down upon their knees
to drink water' instead of lapping with the hand to the mouth, when
he went down against the Midianites.  When the very existence of
one's country is in danger, abstinence even from things simple and
innocent at other times, may form the touchstone of the true 
patriot (Judges vii. 1-7).
