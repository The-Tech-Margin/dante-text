	|1-21.~

     Eager already to search within and round
     The divine forest, dense and living-green,
     Which to the eyes was tempering the new day,
     Without more waiting I left the mountain-edge,
     Taking the level country slowly, slowly,
     Over the soil which everywhere breaths fragrance.
     A sweetly-breathing air, that no mutation
     Had in itself, smote me upon the forehead
     With no heavier stroke than of a gentle wind,
     By which the branches, trembling in accord,
     Were one and all bending toward the part
     Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mount;
     Not, however, from their upright state so swayed
     That the little birds among the tops
     Had to cease practising their every art;
     But with full joy the first breezes of the day,
     Singing, received they in the midst of the leaves,
     Which were keeping a burden to their strains:
     Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on
     Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,
     When AEolus unlooses the Sirocco.

This, so far as his knowledge goes, Ruskin regards as `the sweetest
passage of wood description which exists in literature' [^Modern
Painters~, III. Pt. iv, ch xiv. {Part} 35].  Chiassi is the ancient
Classis, once the port of Ravenna and station of the Roman fleet in the
Adriatic, but now left far inland by the silting up of the rivers.  To
any one who has ever visited the

                              `immemorial wood
     Rooted where once the Adrian wave flowed o'er,'

as Byron calls it, the conclusion is irresistible that the above
passage is an exact description of the famous pine-forest near Ravenna,
one of Dante's favourite haunts: the sirocco from the south-east
bending the trees westward, and the deep and even murmur which it makes
among the pines forming a ground-tone on which float the songs of
birds.  To some it may seem to mar the beauty of the passage to seek in
it any symbolic meaning, but for our present purpose we have no
alternative.  As we shall soon see from Matelda's words, there is a
symbolism of the wind, its source, its movement from the sacred East,
and its changelessness.  But undoubetdly the leading symbolism is the
forest itself and the obvious contrast it bears to the dark and savage
wood in which Dante found himself lost at the beginning of the poem. 
The interpretation which sees in the latter an image of the wild and
tangled political life of Italy is certainly true so far as it goes,
and is confirmed by this deliberately contrasted picture of the forest
of the Earthly Paradise.  For in the ^De Monarchia~, as we have more
than once seen, the Earthly Paradise is a figure of `the blessedness of
this life, which consists in the exercise of man's natural powers'; and
it is the Divinely appointed work of the Emperor to guide mankind to
this happiness, `in accordance with the teaching of philosophy.'  This
`Divine forest' therefore stands as a figure of just and settled
government, a gentle steady breeze of law and order from the holy East
blowing westward, freedom to wander where one will, and such perfect
security that not even a bird's song is silenced through fear of
wrong.  We may compare with the two woods the figures of Justice and
Injustice painted by his friend Giotto in the Arena Chapel in Padua,
perhaps while Dante himself was in that city.  The contrast between the
two turns upon the state of the woods -- their security or insecurity. 
Injustice sits at his castle gate in the midst of a forest, a lance
with hooks in his right hand; while in the predella beneath his feet,
robbers have waylaid a lady in a wood, dragged her from her palfrey,
and stript her.  The figure of Justice reverses all this: in the
predella below her some are dancing to music, and travellers are riding
securely through the woods.  Similarly, Dante can think of no better
image of unjust government than a dark and savage wood, haunted by wild
beasts of lust and pride and avarice; nor of just government than a
`Divine forest,' where a lady, young and beautiful, all alone and
singing in her joy, is gathering flowers in perfect safety.  One of the
weirdest scenes in the ^Inferno~ is the Wood of the Suicides, every
gnarled, twisted tree of which is a soul that has committed the final
outrage of murder upon itself: the Harpies of despair brood in the
fruitless branches above, while below, the souls of prodigals are
pursued and torn to pieces by the hounds of their own insane
improvidence [^Inf.~ xiii. Compare Ambrogio Lorenzetti's famous
frescoes of Good and Bad Government in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena].

The slowness with which Dante advanced into the forest
depths (lines 5 and 22) cannot possibly mean that he was afraid
of this unknown land: freedom from danger is its very
atmosphere.  The idea is either that he is too recently arrived
to plunge at once into its activities; or, more probably, that
the old necessity for strenuous motion is past.  On the Terraces
below, Virgil was constantly urging him on, rebuking his delays,
reminding him of the value of the passing day.  Now that his
purification is completed, the need for this haste is over -- he
is free to sit or walk at his pleasure, for leisure to see the
beauties of the sinless garden is one of the beatitudes of the
sinless state.  Notice, for example, that Matelda, the very type
of the Active Life, is very deliberate in all her movements, like
a lady in the dance, who scarcely lifts her foot from the ground. 
It is no contradiction to this that she is also called `alert'
(l. 83, ^presta~): this union of activity and leisure is the sure
sign that none of her faculties is being wasted or overdriven by
sin.

	|22-33.~  Dante's freedom from fear is shown by his wandering on
until he lost sight of the place at which he entered the forest -- had
he been afraid, he would have been more careful to secure his retreat
by skirting the edge.  His progress is suddenly stopped by a little
river flowing to the left, that is -- remembering that Dante is going
eastward -- from South to North.  The leftward flow, however, is
doubtless symbolic as usual.  It is, as we shall soon learn from
Matelda, the River Lithe, and its motion to the left is connected with
its function of washing away the very memory of sin.  It is probably
for the same reason that it flows `dark dark' (l. 31, |bruna bruna~)
under a perpetual shade which neither sun nor moon can pierce: symbolic
partly of the darkness of sin, and partly of the darkness of oblivion
into which it bears sin away.  Its waters flow down to Cocytus, the
central sink of Hell; for it is generaly identified with the brooklet,
which Dante heard but could not see, as he climbed his way back to `the
bright world.'  Cato calls it `the blind river,' in allusion probably
to the forgetfulness of sin for which it stands.  It is to be noted,
however, that sin has no power to stain its waters, -- their perfect
clearness in which nothing is concealed comes from the pure fountain of
Divine grace from which they flow.  Its companion river, Euno,e, as we
shall see, flows on the other side of the Garden, and refreshes the
memory of every good deed [see ^Inf.~ xxxiv. 127-132; ^Purg.~ i. 40;
xxviii. 28, 124.  Contrast the `bruna bruna' of Lethe with the pale
green shadow under which flows the happier stream of Euno,e (^Purg.~
xxxiii. 109-111)].

	|40-45.~  Lifting his eyes to gaze on `the great variety of the
fresh May flowers' {v. 36} beyond the river, a sudden apparition
banished every other thought:

     A lady all alone, who went along
     Singing, and culling flower from flower,
     With which was painted all her way.

[The variety of the flowers is taken by some to represent the varied
activities of the life of which Matelda is the symbol.]  It is
obviously the fulfilment of the Leah of his morning dream, and he begs
her to draw near that he may hear the words of her song.  There is a
peculiar daintiness and grace about her every movement, like a lady in
the dance who `foot before foot doth scarcely set.'  Maiden-like she
bends down `her honest eyes'; and when at last, from the bank opposite,
she lifts them, they outshine those of Venus when her own son wounded
her by accident [^Purg.~ xxviii. 64-66.  The reference is to Ovid,
^Metam.~ x. 525, 526] -- by which Dante means that he feels himself in
the presence of a new order of love which far surpasses that which had
just been burnt of him so painfully on the Terrace below.  When to the
light of her eyes she added her smile, Dante hated the three paces of
the river which kept them apart as strongly as did Leander the stormy
waters of the Hellespont.  In other words, her eyes are the
`demonstrations' of whatever truth the lady stands for, and her smile
her `persuasions' of it; and Dante feels that, in spite of all his
eager longing, something still hinders him from embracing the higher
life of which she is the symbol.  The three paces are to be identified,
not with the three steps of St. Peter's Gate, confession, contrition,
satisfaction, but rather with the three blows with which he smote his
breast, when he cast himself at the Angel-Confessor's feet, in
acknowledgment of the threefold sin of thought, word and deed [^Purg.~
ix. 111. Plumptre thinks `the three steps may indicate the ordeals of
shame (Canto xxxi. 85-87), which have yet to be passed before Lethe can
be crossed'].  The climb up the Terraces has indeed cleansed him of the
sin itself, but the ^memory~ of it remains, and remains as a paralyzing
power.  Till those three paces of Lethe are crossed -- that is, till
its waters have blotted out the very memory of sin in its three forms
of thought, word and deed -- he feels himself powerless to enter into
the life and joy represented by the beautiful lady on the opposite
bank.  Sin must be not merely forgiven but forgotten, even by the
sinner himself.

Who, then, is this lady?  The question has given rise to
an almost interminable controversy, into which it is impossible
to enter at length.  To show its intricacy, I take the liberty of
quoting Dr. Moore's classification of the various theories:

     (i) The Countess Matilda.
     
     (ii) Some Matilda from Germany.
        (a) The Empress Matilda, wife of the Emperor Henry I.
        (b) Matilda of Hackeborn
        (c) Matilda of Magdeburg.
        (d) Matilda, daughter of the Emperor Henry I.

     (iii) Some friend or associate of Beatrice.
        (a) The `Donna dello schermo' ^Vita Nuova~, 5.
        (b) The friend of Beatrice in ^Vita Nuova~, 8.
        (c) The lady mentioned in ^Vita Nuova~, 18.
        (d) Primavera or Vanna in ^Vita Nuova~, 24.
        (e) The `Donna Gentile' of the ^Vita Nuova~ and ^Convito.~

     (iv) A purely fictitious symbol, without relation to any real or
          historical person [^Studies in Dante~, 3rd Series, p. 213].

Those who are sufficiently interested may read Dr. Moore's discussion
of these theories in the third series of his ^Studies in Dante~, pp.
213-216.  I entirely agree with his conclusion that `the Countess
Matilda, in accordance with the common opinion, still holds the
field.'  The chief objection to `the Great Countess' of Tuscany is that
she was an ardent supporter of the Papacy against the Empire.  She is
best known for the resolution with which she threw all her forces into
the field on the side of Hildebrand in the war of investitures which he
waged against Henry IV.  Her castle of Canossa has become famous as the
scene of the Emperor's penance.  When she died in 1155 at the age of
sixty-nine, she bequeathed to the Church her vast territorial estates
for the redemption of her soul and the souls of her parents.  This
`celebrated donation,' says Gregorovius, `one of the most fatal
bequests known to history, became the apple of discord of the time,
thrown by a woman between the popes and emperors' [^Rome in the Middle
Ages~, iv. 361 (English Translation)].  At first glance, it certainly
seems impossible that an ardent Imperialist like Dante should choose an
equally ardent Papalist as the Guardian-Spirit of the forest of just
government, or transform, as Gardner says, `the stern heroine of
Canossa into this dainty Botticellian girl.'  This argument, however,
would equally exclude Cato, the Guardian of the Mountain's base, as she
is of its summit, for he was as strong an opponent of Caesar as she of
the Emperor.  As to her bequeathing of her possessions to the Church,
it is true that Dante was utterly opposed to such endowments, and
severely censured Constantine for his `Donation'; but none the less he
admitted him to the Sixth Heaven of Paradise, and gave him credit for
his good intention:

     Now knoweth he how the ill, deduced
     From his good deed, not to himself is hurtful
     Although the world thereby may be destroyed.

[^Par.~ xx. 58-60.  Comp. ^Inf.~ xix. 115; ^Purg.~ xxxii. 124-126;
^De Mon.~ iii. 10, 13].  The truth is, Matelda is a symbol,
and Dante did not demand that the symbolic element should run through
the entire life and character, -- he was content if the one quality he
wanted for the purposes of his allegory stood out in sufficient
prominence.  Cato might be the enemy of Caesar, but he was the symbol
of Liberty.  Matelda fought against the Emperor, but where else could
Dante find a truer symbol of the Active Life?  Her very name --
Mechtilde, Battle-might -- was appropriate, even if, as Butler thinks,
Dante was ignorant of its significance.  Her life was one long struggle
for the unity of the Church and against what she regarded as the
unjustifiable encroachments of the Empire, and her energy, courage and
resolution gained her, quite deservedly, the title of `the Great
Countess.'  `This warlike Deborah of the Papacy,' says Gregorovius,
`owing to her practical powers of government, deserves to rank beside
the few great queens who at any age have attained renown.'  When we
remember her fame throughout all Italy and far beyond, the very
casualness with which she is named becomes an indirect proof that no
other can be meant, just as, to quote Miss Rossetti, `any "Elizabeth"
as barely named in an English poem would be unhesitatingly identified
with our great Queen Elizabeth' [^A Shadow of Dante~, p. 184.
Scartazzini draws exactly the opposite conclusion from the casualness
with which Matelda is named in Canto xxxiii. 119.  Since Dante never
asks who she is, he infers that she is one whom he knew in the earthly
life -- perhaps one of the ladies in the ^Vita Nuova~ -- and therefore
not to be indentified with `the great Countess' or any other historical
personage].

The symbolism of Matelda as the Active Life has been set forth
in the beautiful passage quoted from Ruskin in connection with the
dream which foretold her; but there are several points which are worth
bringing into greater clearness.  We have seen that she stands in
contrast to the Negligent Rulers in the Valley of the Princes, just as
the wide Forest does to the narrow Valley itself.  We have also seen
that she is the opposite in every respect to the Siren of Dante's
second dream, with her stammering tongue and eyes asquint, her
distorted feet and maimed hands and unhealthy hue.  But she also stands
in contrast to her old earthly self.  She died at the age of
sixty-nine, but the sinless Garden has restored her youth, perhaps in
accordance with the teaching of Aquinas that all rise ^in aetate
juvenili~, the most perfect age, which begins at about thirty years;
perhaps too to indicate that for perfect work and for perfect joy in
God's work, immortal youth is necessary [^Summa~, iii. ^Suppl.~ q.
lxxxi, a. 1.  On the other hand, Cato's age seems increased.  He died
at the age of forty-nine, but the impression given by ^Purg.~ i. 31-36
is that of a much older man].  Further, all the long war and turmoil
of her earthly government is swept away -- the quiet woodland glades,
the steady wind, the flowers and birds, form a picture and image of
what government is in a sinless world: `the work of righteousness shall
be peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for
ever' [Isa. xxxii. 17.  Righteousness and peace are constantly
associated in Scripture].  It may be as the reward of her former
defence of the Church that it is now her function to guide the soul to
it; but we come nearest to Dante's thought if we see in this the
important truth that the Active Life, righteous government, and a pure
and simple joy in the work of God's hands in Nature, lead to the
higher truths of Revelation.  It is quite away from the idea to see in
Matelda, as Hettinger suggests, a symbol of the priesthood, `through
whose instrumentality we are brought into the Church, the Earthly
Paradise' [^Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 187].  This identification of
the Earthly Paradise with the Church could not possibly have entered
Dante's mind.

There is just one other point.  Miss Rossetti calls attention
to the fact that Matelda is `the only permanent inhabitant' of Eden,
but suggests no reason for this.  May it not be Dante's way of
indicating the limits of her capacity of blessedness?  Had he not seen
in her ^some~ limitation, there is no reason why he should not have set
her among the Righteous Rulers of the Sixth Heaven.  Obviously he
regards her as the highest type of ^earthly~ activity, but the
Celestial Paradise is beyond her.  Like the Guardian of the base of the
Mount, her fate is to see generation after generation of penitent souls
pass on to a higher bliss from which she herself is meantime shut out. 
Even the highest earthly government is not the final `kingdon of
heaven,' and perhaps, in Dante's opinion, Matelda had no other ideal. 
At all events, it certainly cannot be without meaning that her
blessedness is limited to an Earthly Paradise.  In `the white star' of
Jupiter Dante shows us the just kings of every age and land in the form
of starry lights spelling out, letter by letter, the opening words of
the Book of Wisdom: ^Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram~, by which
he means that each contributes something to the ideal and eternal
Empire, the symbol and standard of which is the imperial eagle which
settled on the final M [^Par.~ xviii. 70-117].  If he regarded the
opposition of the Great Countess to the earthly Empire as her refusal
to contribute her share, it would account for his exclusion of her for
a time from the celestial Empire of universal righteousness.

	|76-81.~  It is somewhat strange to find that Matelda's first care
is to make a kind of apology for her smile, as if it threw
suspicion on her as being out of keeping with the sinless Garden
-- the place

     `Elect to human nature for its nest.'

The suspicion can scarcely be as Benvenuto thinks, that she was
`love-smitten' (^philocapta~), because Dante had addressed her as
one who `warmed herself at the rays of love' (vv. 43, 44).  It is
rather the reflection of Dante's own feeling.  He and his
companions are newcomers, as she says, -- too recently arrived to
be able yet to enter into the spirit of the place.  Dante had
just finished a long and exhausting climb, and the anguish of the
final fire was too fresh on his soul to let him enter in a moment
into the joy of Paradise Regained.  The `three steps' of Lethe
lay between -- the sad memory of his threefold sin.  Perhaps too
the Garden itself was so much associated in his mind with the
infinite sin and sorrow its loss had caused, that smiles and
laughter seemed incongruous, out of place.  Matelda explains her
joy by the Psalm ^Delectasti~ which she was singing:

     For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work:
     I will triumph in the works of thy hands. [Psalm xcii. 4].

This joy in the work of ^God's~ hands is, as we saw, far higher
than that of Leah, which was in the work of ^her own~ hands, and
which passed away like a dream.  Instead of being inconsistent
with the Earthly Paradise, it is precisely that which constitutes
its proper blessedness.  Sadness involves the loss of God's
works, as the souls fixed in the mire at the bottom of the
Stygian Fen discovered:

                              `Sad were we
     In the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened,
     Bearing within ourselves the slothful smoke:
     Now are we sad in the black mire.'

Some of this sadness clings to Dante even here, and makes him marvel to
see Matelda smile in such a place [^Inf.~ vii. 121-124.  Professor
Earle takes a very different view.  The free talk about love is the
sign of the return to a state of perfect innocence.  `This Fair Lady is
not any one particular person at all; she is not a woman but Woman. 
And this will afford the first clue to the part assigned her.  As in
the history of the Fall the persuasion of Eve had seconded the wiles of
the tempter, and seduced Adam from duty, so reversely, in this Eden
Regained, Woman is instrumental in promoting the cause of man's
happiness and edification.'  The weak point of this ingenious view is
that it makes the name Matelda more mysterious than ever: why should
Dante call Woman in the abstract Matelda? (Introduction to Dr.
Shadwell's ^Purgatorio~, Part. II. xxiv-xxvi)].

She now offers to answer any question Dante may ask, addressing
him as `thou who art in front.'  The order of the three Pilgrims is
reversed.  Virgil has resigned his office as guide and fallen into the
background, -- the purified will is a law unto itself.  Statius too has
dropped behind: as `a secret Christian' who conformed to Pagan customs,
he was neither worthy nor able to guide a soul that made open
confession of Christ [^Purg.~ xxii. 90, 91; see {comm. to 22.64-93}].

	|85-87.~  Dante now states his difficulty.  If, as Statius had
assured him on the Fifth Terrace, neither rain fell nor wind blew
higher up the Mountain than St. Peter's Gate [^Purg.~ xxi. 40, 54],
what is the meaning of this flowing river and the sound as of a breeze
among the trees of the forest?  In reply Matelda explains first the
phenomenon of the wind, or what seems such to Dante.  God, she says,
gave this place to man as `an earnest of eternal peace,' that is, of
the Celestial Paradise for which He had created him.  When he fell soon
after his creation, the happy Garden which he lost was raised to this
great height above all variations of weather, that the storms which
rage below the Gate `might not wage any war against mankind.'  The
reference seems to be to the upheaval of Mount Purgatory caused by the
fall of Satan [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 121-126].  From the Gate upward, then, the
Mountain stands perfectly free of all atmospheric disturbances.  `The
sound of the forest' is due to one steady movement of the Heavens
above, not to the ever-veering winds of earth below.  This movement
originates with `the primal turning,' that is, the ^Primum Mobile~, the
Ninth Heaven, which revolves from East to West in twenty-four hours. 
This inconceivable velocity communicates itself to all the lower
spheres, growing less and less rapid as it descends.  When it reaches
the sphere of air which surrounds the earth, the motion is
comparatively slow and gentle; and as the earth itself, according to
Dante's astronomy, is stationary, any profection on its surface, such
as the great altitude of the Mount, interrupts the revolving air.

	|88-120.~  Matelda proceeds to explain the growth of the
plant-life of Paradise.  The holy soil brings forth of itself.  Its
plants have such virtue that, when swept by the revolving sphere, they
impregnate the air, and this in its circling scatters the seed
abroad upon the lower earth.  Plants which surprise us by
springing up `without manifest seed' are the gifts of Paradise to
the fallen world.  Not every seed of `the holy plain,' however,
is thus carried to our earth: no fruit, for example, from the
Tree of Life is plucked down here below; but the underlying
thought, as Plumptre says, is that `all truth and goodness in
man's present state is but the survival of his primal state, the
remnants of a lost blessedness.'

	|121-133.~  In similar fashion, the water of Paradise has no
earthly source -- it is fed inexhaustibly by the will of God:

     `The water which thou seest springs not from a vein
     Restored by vapour which the cold converts,
     Like a river which gains and loses breath;
     But issues from a fountain constant and sure,
     Which by the will of God as much regains
     As it pours forth, open upon two sides.
     Upon this side with virtue it descends,
     Which takes away from men the memory of sin;
     On the other, of every good deed done restores it.
     Here Lethe, as upon the other side
     Euno,e, it is called; and worketh not
     If first on this side and on that it be not tasted.
     This every other savour doth transcend.'
     
This is Dante's familiar mingling of Scripture and heathen mythology. 
In the Greek mysteries it seems to have been taught that two rivers
flow through Hades -- one of Forgetfulness, the other of Memory.  Dante
transforms both into symbols of the Divine mercy.  For the perfect
blessedness of the redeemed soul, two things are necessary --
forgetfulness of its past sins and the quickening of its memory of
former good deeds.  Hence from the one fountain of Divine mercy flow
forth two rivers: Lethe to the left because it carries away the memory
of evil, and Euno,e to the right because it restores the memory of
good.  The name Euno,e comes from the Greek
%epsilon%upsilon%nu%omicron%omicron%sigma\, `well minded,' the stream
of `kindly thoughts,' as one calls it.  The flowing of the two rivers
from one fountain seems to come from Genesis ii. 6, where the Vulgate
reads `^fons~ ascendebat e terra,' instead of, as in the English
version, `there went up a ^mist~ from the earth'; and in Canto xxxiii.
112-114, he seems to identify them symbolically with Euphrates and
Tigris [see Dr. Moore's ^Studies~, 3rd Series, pp. 136-139.  Milton
(^Par. Lost~, ii. 570-614) sets Lethe in Hell between the lake of fire
and a frozen continent, swept with whirlwind and hail.  All the damned
are haled from the one to the other that they may feel the `fierce
extremes' of fire and ice.  As they cross Lethe, they struggle to reach
its waters; but Fate withstands, Medusa guards the ford, and the river
itself shrinks from their touch].  They represent, as already said,
the inexhaustible mercy of God, by whose will alone the waters poured
forth are perpetually renewed.

There can be no doubt, however, that the symbolism is far from
being exhausted by this explanation.  We saw when discussing the
exposition of Statius of the cessation of changes of weather at St.
Peter's Gate, that these changes represent symbolically the
fluctuations of sin and temptation.  The lower sky is under `the prince
of the power of the air.'  The exclusion of these variations from the
Earthly Paradise cannot but mean the entire absence of evil.  And this
gives a peculiar significance to Matelda's joy in the works of God. 
Down on the fallen earth His works cannot give perfect joy: the shock
and dislocation of sin has passed through them, leaving them
unsteadfast, insecure, dangerous; and of this the variations of weather
are regarded as the symbol [Milton also represents the variation of
weather as due to the Fall, but differs from Dante in attributing them
to Angels, not demons (^Par. Lost~, x. 649 ff.)].  But on this high
tableland which stands clear of these fluctuations of sin and passion,
the works of God are perfect and give perfect joy.  The wind, subject
to no `prince of the power of the air,' is produced by the heavens
above, a wind of the Spirit which blows with the constancy of God
Himself, draws their virtue from the trees, and carries many a seed of
blessing to the sinful world far below.  The sacred soil brings forth
of itself, without seed, by the direct power of God.  The water flows
from the fountain of His grace, and is perpetually renewed by His
will.  No storm causes it to overflow; nor any heat of summer to dry
up.  It is in ^these~ works of God Matelda rejoices -- works that come
straight from His own hand, unruined by sin, sure and steadfast in all
their movements and operations, carrying peace and joy whithersoever
they go.  It is for such works as these she sings ^Delectasti~ with
smiles -- they restore the `honest laughter and sweet mirth' which Adam
so quickly `changed to tears and toil' [^Purg.~ xxviii. 94-96.  In much
of this Dante follows Aquinas, who says the Earthly Paradise is a
corporeal place with temperate air and flowers in everlasting bloom
(^Summa~, i, q. cii)].

It is difficult to understand what Dante says in verses
130-132, -- that Lethe does not work unless Euno,e is also tasted.  We
naturally take this to mean that forgetgulness of sin and remembrance
of good deeds keep equal pace, that the good memory is necessary to
blot out the bad.  Yet in Canto xxxiii. 91-96 we find that Dante
himself, ^before~ tasting Euno,e, has utterly forgotten his
unfaithfulness to Beatrice for which she had shortly before made him
weep so bitterly, and she has to remind him that he had drunk of Lethe
that very day.  Dr. Oelsner suggests the explanation that `the true
function of the twofold stream is to sift out evil and sinful memories
from the sources of joy and gratitude with which they are ofter
inseparably mixed up on earth' [^Purgatorio~ (Temple Classics), p.
360].  Perhaps the simpler idea is better, that their function is to
prepare the soul for the Celestial Paradise, the blessedness of which
is impossible until the good memory is quickened, as well as the bad
taken away.  The difficulty, however, does not end here.  When we turn
to the ^Paradiso~ we find that memory of past sins has not faded
^absolutely~ from the souls of the redeemed -- they are remembered
intellectually, but forgotten as experience, to take St. Augustine's
distinction.  If this were not so, gratitude to God for salvation were
impossible.  As Folco of Marseilles says after recalling his evil
life:

     `Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,
     Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,
     But at the Worth which ordered and foresaw.
     Here we gaze back into the art which beautifies
     Its own so great effect, and we discern the good
     Whereby to the world above returns that below.'
                    [^Par.~ ix. 103-108.]

This then gives us the sense in which we are to understand the
operation of the twofold river: the memory of sin as an experience
passes away, but the intellectual memory remains, else there could be
no gratitude for salvation; and on the other hand, Euno,e recalls so
vividly the good which has come even out of evil, that the pain and
sorrow of repentance are swallowed up in an adoring and grateful
contemplation of the Divine `art' which so `ordered and foresaw' that
all things have worked together for good.  `In that City of God,' says
St. Augustine, `there will be free will, one in all and indivisible in
each, freed from all evil and filled with all good, enjoying
indefectibly the sweetness of eternal bliss, oblivious of sins,
oblivious of sufferings, and yet not so oblivious of its deliverance as
to be ungrateful to its Deliverer' [^City of God~, xxii. 30.  Aquinas
says: `Although Charity is now (^i.e.~ in the present life) a cause of
grieving for sin, yet the saints in the Fatherland (^in patria~) will
be so flooded with joy, that grief can have no place in them: and so
they will not grieve for sins, but rather rejoice in the Divine mercy
by which they have been released from their sins' (^Summa~, iii.
^Suppl.~ q. lxxxvii, a. 1)].  Psychologically, it is extremely
difficult to conceive of this oblivion of sin, but at least we shall
see that Dante did not regard it as a mere magic change, independent of
ethical conditions.

	|136-148.~  To her exposition of the wind and water of the sinless
land, Matelda adds `a corollary for a grace':


     `They who in ancient time have feigned in song
     The Age of Gold and its estate of happiness,
     Perchance in Parnassus of this place did dream.
     Here the root of the human race was innocent;
     Here Spring is evermore, and every fruit;
     This is the nectar of which each one speaks.'
                    
Turning to his poets, he found them smiling with pleasure at this `last
interpretation,' the fulfilment of their dream.  The chief reference is
probably to the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil, by which Statius was `lighted
on to God.'  As we have so often seen, Dante regards many heathen myths
as unconscious foregleams, or perhaps echoes, of the truths of
Revelation [^e.g.~ Lactantius (^Div. Institutes~, Bk. vii. ch. xxiv)
quotes ^Ecl.~ iv. 21-45 as a prophecy of the renewal of the earth]. 
This is his way of acknowledging his debt to his guides, and in
particular to Virgil, who has led him to the true Paradise, of which he
himself could only dream.  `There is an infinite pathos,' says
Plumptre, `in the smile of Virgil.'  This momentary glimpse of the true
Age of Gold is all his share of it.  But at least when he returns to
the green enamel of the meadow in the hemisphere of light, he will be
able to tell his brother-poets of the Divine Forest which is the
fulfilment of their ancient dream.  For himself, Dante feels that these
poetic visions of the natural reason are past; he must now address
himself to the Active Life which converts them into reality:

     Then to the fair Lady I turned my face.
