	|1-6.~  We come now to the description of the penitent 
souls.  When Dante heard the voice speaking out of the Tree of 
Temperance, he stood so long gazing in the leaves, like him `who loses
his life after the little birds,' that Virgil has to call 
him away to a more profitable use of his time.  The censure of 
fowling is somewhat puzzling, and has been thought to refer to 
this sin of Gluttony -- the destruction of small birds, such as 
larks and nightingales, to gratify the palate of the gourmand.  
In mediaeval religious paintings falconry is regarded as a losing 
of life, a nobleman with a hawk on hand being introduced as one 
type of worldliness (compare the hunting party in the ^Triumph of 
Death~ of the Campo Santo of Pisa).  Probably, however, what 
Dante is really censured for is the wasting of his time in a vain 
curiosity which was akin to that which led Eve to the first sin.  
She, as he says afterwards, `endured not to remain under any 
veil,' that is, her curiosity to know good and evil tore away the 
veil with which her innocence concealed them.  Curiosity, which 
may be regarded as an intemperance of the mind, is held by 
Aquinas to be a vice when, as in the case of Dante here, it draws 
aside from some duty, and pries into some truth beyond human ken  
(^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clxvii, a. 1; Gen. iii. 6; ^Purg.~ xxix. 26- 
27.  Aquinas regards studiousness as `a potential part of 
temperance,' since the natural desire for knowledge must be 
restrained so as not to push investigation beyond the bounds of 
moderation.  `Curiosity' is an inordinate appetite for knowledge, 
which may show itself in four ways: (1) by withdrawing us from 
duty; (2) by seeking knowledge from an unlawful source; (3) by 
neglecting the due end, which is the knowledge of God; (4) by 
searching into things too high for us.  Compare Raphael's warning 
to Adam (^Par. Lost~, vii. 126-130):  
  
     `But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less  
     Her temperance over appetite, to know  
     In measure what the mind may well contain;  
     Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns  
     Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind').  
  
	|7-12.~  As Dante follows his guides listening to their 
discourse, a mournful song strikes on his ears: `^Labia mea 
Domine~,' rousing joy and grief -- a mingled feeling to which, as 
we shall see, he calls special attention on this Terrace.  The 
words of the Chant are from the ^Miserere~, Psalm li. 15: `O 
Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy 
praise,' a Psalm which, as Vernon points out, `forms part of the 
services of ^Lauds~ for Tuesdays, and it is on Easter Tuesday 
that the present scene is supposed to be taking place.'  
 
	|16-24.~  The obvious contrast is between the mouths once 
opened by themselves, and only for gluttony and its roystering 
songs, now opened by God for the showing forth of His praise.  
This contrast with their former life is carried out in several 
particulars which is easy to miss.  The crowd of penitents who 
now overtake the three poets are compared to a procession of 
`thoughtful pilgrims' -- thoughtfulness being one of the last 
things you expect of men whose minds, as Spenser says, were once 
drowned in meat and drink.  In contrast to their old laziness, 
they are now so eager and alert that they content themselves with 
a glance at the strangers over their shoulders, and pass on 
rapidly without a pause.  Finally, they are `silent and devout,' 
in contrast to their former ^much talking~ and ^buffoonery~, that 
immoderation in word and action which Aquinas names among the 
five `daughters of gluttony' (according to Aquinas the species of 
gluttony are `distinguished according to these five conditions: 
too soon, too expensively, too much, too eagerly, too daintily'; 
and the five `daughters of gluttony' are: `inept mirth, 
buffoonery, uncleanness, much talking, and dulness of mind for 
intellectual things' [^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxlviii, a. 4, 6]).  In 
these various directions they are unlearning the evil habits  
which their intemperance has bred in them.  
  
	|31-36.~  Dante is startled by the fearful emaciation of the 
crowd.  It is a procession of skeletons, as if the famine-worn 
`people who lost Jerusalem' were marching past (two examples of 
the horrors of famine are given: Erysicthon who for cutting down 
trees sacred to Ceres was reduced to eating his own flesh [Ovid, 
^Metam.~ viii. 738 ff.], and a Jewess called Mary, who during the 
siege of Jerusalem by Titus devoured her own child [Josephus, 
^Wars of the Jews~, vi. 3]: {see} ^Purg.~ xxii. 25-30):  
  
     Their eye-sockets seemed rings without the gems;  
     He who in the face of man reads ^omo~  
     Might plainly there have recognized the ^m.~  
 
The allusion is to a fancy of mediaeval theologians that God  
had written the words ^Homo Dei~ on the `human face divine,' in  
token that man is created in His image, in some such fashion as  
this: {pictured is a gothic ^m~ with two small ^o~'s: one  
inside each arch of the ^m~}.  Longfellow gives the following 
extract from a sermon by Brother Berthold, a Franciscan monk of 
Regensburg, in the thirteenth century: `The two eyes are two 
^o~'s.  The ^h~ is properly no letter; it only helps the others; 
so that ^homo~ with an ^h~ means Man.  Likewise the brows arched 
above and the nose down between them are an ^m~, beautiful with 
three strokes.  So is the ear a ^d~, beautifully rounded and 
ornamented.  So are the  
nostrils beautifully formed like a Greek %epsilon\, beautifully 
rounded and ornamented.  So is the mouth an ^i~, beautifully 
adorned and ornamented.  Now behold, ye good Christian people, 
how skillfully he has adorned you with these six letters, to show 
that ye are his own, and that he has created you!  Now read me and ^o~
and an ^m~ and another ^o~ together; that spells ^homo.~  Then read me
a ^d~ and an ^e~ and an ^i~ together; that spells ^dei.~  ^Homo  
dei~, man of God, man of God!'  If Dante is thinking of this  
particular fancy, the suggestion is that the sin of gluttony has  
terribly marred the Divine image: only the ^m~ is visible, and it 
will be long before the likeness is restored.  To add to the  
horror, the fasting has produced a scaly eruption on the skin,  
which greatly increases the disfigurement.  Dante is amazed to  
think that the mere scent of fruit and of water could, by the  
craving it begets, produce such an extremity of emaciation.  
  
	|42-48.~  His wonder is cut short by one of the souls fixing 
his cavernous eyes upon him with the cry: `What grace to me is 
this?' -- and begging him not to turn away from his scurf-disfigured  
face without giving him news of himself and his companions.  But  
for the voice, Dante would never have recognized in that deformed 
countenance his old friend, Forese Donati, kinsman of his wife  
Gemma, and other brother of that Corso Donati to whom the poet  
owed his banishment from Florence.  
 
	|58-66.~  In reply, Dante begs him in God's name to tell him 
first `what strips him so'; whereupon Forese gives the 
explanation which we have already examined, namely that the scent 
of the water and fruit of the first Tree have a divinely-given 
power to quicken the desire to eat and drink, and that by hunger 
and thirst the whole crowd of penitents `re-sanctify themselves.' 
  
	|70-75.~  {Forese} adds that they suffer a periodical  
renewal of the pain, evidently in the regular return of appetite  
or fits of craving:  
  
     `And not one time alone, in circling round  
     This course, our pain renews itself;  
     I say pain, and I ought to say solace;  
     For that will doth lead us to the Tree,  
     Which led Christ joyfully to say "Eli,"  
     When with His veins He set us free.'  
 
We have in these lines the fundamental idea of Purgatorial pain,  
in that absolute acceptance of it as the will of God which turns  
it into positive comfort -- the idea which Newman works out so  
wonderfully in his ^Dream of Gerontius.~  To show the perfection  
with which their wills accept the purifying pain, Forese does not 
hesitate to draw a parallel between the penitents and Christ at  
the darkest moment of His Passion.  The cry, `My God, my God, why 
hast thou forsaken me?' in spite of its apparent desolation, had  
a central heart of secret joy.  The mere fact that He was able  
even then to say `Eli,' `^my~ God,' was to Dante's mind the sign  
and proof of the joyful surrender of the inner will even to that  
awful pain.  It was by this joyful will, which not even the  
forsaking of God could cause to falter, that He was able to set  
us free by His blood: had it faltered the Atonement would have  
failed.  It is by the perfect union of their wills with His in  
joyful surrender to suffering for sin, that the freedom which He  
bought for the penitents becomes their own, and is wrought into  
the substance of their souls.  
  
	|76-84.~  Dante is greatly surprised to find Forese so high 
up as this Terrace.  He had died on July 28, 1296, not quite five 
years before; and his `power to sin more' had come to an end -- 
that is, his last illness had probably made the sin of gluttony a 
physical impossibility -- before his soul turned to God in 
penitence.  According to the law of Purgatory, he ought to be 
still on the Mountain's base below, `where time by time is 
restored,' detained as many years as his repentance was 
postponed.  
 
	|85-114.~  Forese replies that he owes this grace to his 
widow, `la Nella mia.'  Her tears and prayers drew him from 
Ante-Purgatory and freed him from the other circles, and led him 
to drink thus early `the sweet wormwood of the torments.'  The 
eulogy pronounced on Forese's widow is in striking contrast to 
his treatment of her during life, if we are to believe the 
extremely coarse sonnet in which Dante describes it.  `The 
present passage may have been intended by the poet to atone in a 
measure for that poem, and to offer the widow some consolation by 
representing Forese, in his new condition, as one of the 
tenderest of husbands' (^Purgatorio~ [Temple Classics], p. 
294]).  He certainly atones for past neglect.  His widow is the 
one good woman left in Florence.  It is her very loneliness in 
good works which gave her prayers their special power with God; 
her virtue is more precious in His eyes, because maintained in 
face of universal profligacy (just as, conversely, it is regarded 
as an aggravation of Eve's sin that it was committed when she was 
alone, without companion to suggest it [Canto xxix. 26]; see 
{comm. to ^Purg.~ 29.16-27}.  There is no reason to suppose, as 
some do, that Dante is casting any reflection upon his own wife).  
Then follows a stern denunciation of the shamelessness of the 
Florentine women, which reminds us of a well-known passage in 
Isaiah (iii. 16-24).  They surpass the women of Barbagia in 
Sardinia, notorious for their immorality; and did ever barbarian 
or Saracen women require, as they do, interdicts from the pulpit 
`to make them go covered'?  The reference is uncertain, as it 
seems to be doubtful whether any sumptuary laws were passed about 
the time of which Dante speaks (Napier, however, in his 
^Florentine History~ [i. 404], writing of the period 1300-1307, 
says: `Sumptuary laws against the vanity of women were renewed; 
no chaplets or crowns of gold or silver nor any jewels could be 
longer worn, and fathers, brothers, and husbands were made 
answerable for all female transgressions of this vain and venial 
nature').  The luxury of the Florentine women, however, was 
notorious; and the subject is introduced here because it is akin 
to the sin of this Terrace: immoderation in food, in drink, and 
in dress not infrequently go together.  Aquinas discusses the 
question `whether indulgence of the love of dress is a mortal sin 
in women'; and replies that `if they dress themselves with this 
express purpose, that people may fall in love with them, they sin 
mortally: but if it is done out of thoughtlessness, or vanity and 
love of display, it is not always a mortal sin, but venial sometimes'
(^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clxix, a. 2).  Forese foretells that the vengeance
of Heaven will fall on these shameless women ere the child now soothed
with lullaby shall have bearded cheeks.  This is usually taken as a
general prophecy of the various calamities which befell Florence in the
years immediately succeeding 1300, but the reference is probably much
more specific.  If we suppose that the passage was written sometime
between 1310 and 1313, when the exile's hopes of Henry VII. ran high,
the vengeance here may be identical with that which he 
predicted in his famous Letter to the Florentines, written in 
1311, in which he `breathed forth threatenings and slaughter.' 
The words with which Forese introduces his prophecy: `For, if my 
foresight here deceive me not,' are echoed in the Letter: `And -- 
if my presaging mind be not deceived, as it announceth that which 
it hath learned from truth-telling signs, and arguments that may 
not be gainsaid, -- your city, worn out with long-drawn 
sufferings, shall be given at last into the hands of the aliens, 
the greatest part of you scattered in death and captivity, while 
the few that are left to endure their exile shall look on and 
weep' (^Epis.~ vi. 4 [Wicksteed's Translation]).  This date would 
give a definite meaning to the still beardless cheeks of those 
who were but infants a dozen years before.  
  
	|115-130.~  We now come to a passage of considerable 
difficulty, in which the poet plainly makes confession of some 
evil of his past life in which Forese and he were partners.  
Seeing that Dante `veiled the sun' from him, Forese begs him to 
`hide himself no more,' that is, to inform him how he came to be 
there while still in the flesh.  In reply Dante reminds him of 
some evil of the past which they shared together, and explains 
that Virgil had rescued him from that sinful life when the moon 
was full the other day, had led him so far up the Mount, and 
would continue to guide him until he reached the presence of 
Beatrice (it has been pointed out that this is the only time 
Dante speaks of Beatrice by name to any of the souls on the Mount 
-- probably because his friend Forese would understand the 
reference).  The interest gathers round the sinful passage in the 
past:  
  
               `If thou bring back to mind  
     What thou with me hast been and I with thee,  
     The present memory will be grevious still.'  
 
The meaning is much disputed.  From the Terrace we might infer 
that it is a confession of riotous feasting in which the two were 
boon companions.  Vernon calls this a `purely unimaginative view,' and
refers to the testimony of Boccaccio and Filippo Villani that 
Dante was abstemious in his diet.  The obvious answer is that both 
might be true -- the change to temperance might have come just 
about this time, as, indeed, Dante here says it did.  The 
probability, however, is that the reference is to six sonnets 
which passed between the two, and in which they abuse each other 
with all candour of friendship.  It were well for the reputation 
of both of them if the view which some take that the poems are 
spurious could be proved true, for they are no credit to either.  
Dante calls Forese a glutton, and pities the wife who has so 
neglectful a husband; and Forese retorts by calling Dante and his 
father cowards.  There is no need to enter further into the 
unsavoury quarrel, especially as Dante recalls it in this passage 
only to express his sorrow for it.  Death had washed away all 
bitterness; the dead face of his friend, he says, had made him 
weep; and now, in the light of a world nearer God, they both see 
and confess the sin and folly of the wounds they once inflicted 
on each other (the Sonnets, which are, as Karl Federn says, `a 
kind of tap-room poetry, especially those of Dante,' are 
translated by Rossetti in ^Dante and his Circle~, pp. 243-245.  
In his ^Dante~ [Temple Primers] Mr. E. G. Gardner says they are 
`almost certainly authentic'; but in his recent edition of 
Rossetti's ^Early Italian Poets~ [Temple Classics], he omits 
them, apparently as apocryphal or of no importance.  It would 
certainly be a relief to believe that Dante never wrote those 
attributed to him.  Scartazzini, however, accepts them as 
genuine).
