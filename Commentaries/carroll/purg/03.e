	|7-9.~  When Cato's rebuke scattered the listening crowd toward 
the hill like a flock of startled doves, the two poets joined in 
the general flight.  Dante, however, indicates plainly enough 
that he did not regard the fault for which they were so sharply 
reproved as a very serious one.  Virgil hurries toward the 
Mountain with greater shame than the occasion calls for: 
 
       He seemed to me within himself remorseful, 
       O noble conscience, and without a stain, 
       How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee! 
 
This may seem scarcely consistent with the interpretation of the 
`song of love' given in last chapter {see comm. to ^Purg.~ 2.118-123}. 
If, for instance, the pursuit of Philosophy is an element of that
unfaithfulness to herself with which Beatrice charged Dante so sternly
in the Earthly Paradise above, it is obvious that ^she~ at least did
not regard it as a `trivial fault.'  Nor did Dante when he stood before
her, scarce able to falter forth his grief for tears.  What seems to
his unpurified conscience at the foot of the Mountain a slight error,
is seen at last to have been one of the fountain-heads of the Seven
Deadly Sins, which he has purged away with so much pain and labour. 
(The relation of Philosophy to Dante's unfaithfulness to Beatrice,
however, must not be exaggerated.  It is only one element, and not the
most important.  The `school' referred to in ^Purg.~ xxxiii. 85-90 is
not, as is commonly assumed, Philosophy in general, but, as the entire
context shows, the politico-theological school which claimed `the two
governments,' temporal and spiritual, for the Papacy.  Aquinas
advocates it in his ^De Regimine Principium~, but his teaching is
utterly repudiated by Dante in the ^De Monarchia~ and the Cantos
dealing with the Earthly Paradise.)
 
	|10-11.~  When in a little Virgil moderates his pace, there is 
something almost amusing in the characteristic words in which 
Dante conveys the information: 
 
       When his feet had laid aside the haste 
       Which mars the dignity of every act. 
 
Aristotle's description of the magnanimous man was certainly in 
his mind: `It seems too that the high-minded man will be slow in 
his movements, his voice will be deep and his manner of speaking 
sedate; for it is not likely that a man will be in a hurry, if 
there are not many things that he cares for, or that he will be 
emphatic, if he does not regard anything as important, and these 
are the causes which make people speak in shrill tones and use 
rapid movements.'  One cannot but be reminded of the great 
spirits of antiquity in Limbo (^Inf.~ iv. 112-114; Aquinas, quoting the
above passage from the ^Ethics~ [iv. 9], says: `It is to be remarked
that rapidity of gait comes from a man having many things in view, and
being in a hurry to accomplish them; whereas the magnanimous man has
only great objects in view, and there are few such, and what there are
require great attention; and therefore he is slow of gait' [^Summa~,
ii-ii, q. cxxix, a. 3, English Translation]; in ^Inf.~ ii. 44, Virgil
is called `the Magnanimous'): 
 
       People were there with solemn eyes and slow, 
       Of great authority in their countenance; 
       They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices, 
 
and of Sordello on the edge of the Valley of the Princes watching 
the poets like a lion couchant, with eyes `majestic and slow' (^Purg.~
vi. 61-63).  The chief interest of the words, however, is that they are
characteristic of Dante's own temperament.  His friend and neighbour
the historian Giovanni Villani describes him as `somewhat haughty,
reserved, and disdainful, after the fashion of a philosopher'
(^Chronicle~, ix. 136); and haughty and reserved men almost invariably
have Dante's feeling that haste mars their dignity.  It is an infirmity
of temperament which he outgrows.  Here at the Mountain foot his
personal dignity is more to him than the purifying of his soul; but by
the time he has climbed to the Fourth Terrace he has learnt that there
is a haste without which there is no true dignity at all.  The Slothful
come sweeping round the Terrace in such haste that they will not stop
to speak with him, and crying, 
 
       `Quick!  Quick! that the time may not be lost 
       Through little love' (^Purg.~ xviii. 103).

(Mary's ^strenuitas~ [to use Bonaventura's word] in going in haste to
the hill country is the virtue set over against ^acedia~ in xviii.
100.)  In the ^Paradiso~ he learns that the Angelic circles wheel round
God with a swiftness which is in the exact measure of their love and
service (^Par.~ xxviii. 22-45).  In short, the dignity which counts
itself marred by haste is often only another name for sloth. 
 
	|19-33.~  As they move toward the heights, Dante tells us he was
startled by noticing that while the sun threw his own shadow on 
the ground before him, it cast none of his companion.  In terror 
lest he was forsaken, he turned eagerly to see if his `Comfort' 
was still by his side.  This is his first opportunity of noticing 
that Virgil cast no shadow, for the Inferno was a world of 
darkness in which the sun never shone.  This seems to be 
introduced in order to follow up Cato's rebuke of Philosophy, for 
Virgil, in his character of Reason, uses it as a text to point 
out the limits of the human intellect.  Dante's fear that he was 
deserted sprang from his ignoring the existence of such limits. 
His folly lay in assuming that God's creative power was confined 
to the one species of body with which he was familiar.  Virgil's 
own body in which once he cast a shadow had been taken from 
Brundusium and now lay at Naples (`I cannot help quoting,' says
Plumptre, `a verse from the striking hymn said to have been sung at
Mantua in the fifteenth century, and, it may be, earlier, in the
Festival of St. Paul.  St. Paul, it was said, went to Naples to visit
the tomb of Virgil: -- "Ad Maronis mausoleum / Ductus, fudit super eum,
/ Pie rorem lacrymae; / `Quem te,' inquit, `reddidissem, / Si te vivum
invenissem, / Poetarum Maxime.'"'  He adds, however, that the evidence
for this is hazy); but God had given him another quality of body, which
no more obstructs the sunlight than the nine spheres of Heaven hinder
the rays from descending from one to another.  Moreover these
transparent bodies are so made that they can `suffer torments of heat
and cold' (Aquinas, ^Summa~, iii. Suppl. q. lxx, a. 1, 2, 3).

	|34-39.~  But the manner of all this is intentionally hidden from
us by God; and for Reason to attempt to draw aside the veil is a
species of intellectual insanity (^Purg.~ iii. 34-39): 
 
       `Mad is he who hopeth that our reason 
       Can traverse the illimitable way 
       Which one Substance in three Persons follows. 
       Remain, O human race, contented at the ^quia~! 
       For if ye had been able to see all, 
       No need was there for Mary to give birth.' 

(In scholastic phraseology, the ^quia~ is equivalent to the ^fact~, the
thing which can be demonstrated by means of the ^effect.~  It is
opposed to the ^quid~, the thing which is demonstrated by its final
^cause.~  Dante's meaning is that human reason being powerless to
penetrate to the essence of ^quiddity~, must remain contented with the
^quia,~ the fact as seen in its effects.)  In other words, the mystery
of the Trinity should teach us that not less mysterious are the
operations of its power.  We must be content with the ^quia~, the mere
fact, without knowing the ^how~ and ^why.~  It is the very existence of
such limits which made the Incarnation necessary.  `If God had wished
man to know everything, He would not have forbidden our first parents
to touch the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  If they had not
disobeyed, the human race would not have been doomed, and there would
have been no need of the Incarnation of Christ, and the Redemption of
Man' (Vernon, ^Readings on the Purgatorio~, i. 94; compare Canto xxix.
22-30 [p. 399] for Eve's refusal `to remain under any veil').  In this
view Dante takes his side in a famous controversy of mediaeval
theology, which is by no means ended yet, namely, whether there would
have been an Incarnation of God had there been no Fall.  St. Thomas
Aquinas, whom Dante here follows, decides after much hesitation against
the view of his master, Albertus Magnus.  In the Third Part of the
^Summa~ (q. i, a. 3), he holds that Scripture always assigns sin as the
cause of the Incarnation, and adds: `Take away the diseases, take away
the wounds, and there is no cause for the medicine.' 
 
	|40-45.~  Having thus pointed out the limits of Reason in
Scripture, Virgil reminds Dante of their sad issues outside the sphere
of Revelation: 
 
       `And ye have seen desiring without fruit 
       Those whose desire would have been quieted, 
       Which evermore is given them for a grief. 
       I speak of Aristotle and of Plato, 
       And of many others.'  And here he bent his brow, 
       And more he said not, and remained distressed. 
 
(In ^Inf.~ iv. Dante sees the wisest of the Heathen in a light `which
conquers a hemisphere of darkness.'  It is the hemisphere of natural
Reason; the other hemisphere of Revelation is withheld.  The problem of
the salvation of the heathen world is one that greatly exercised
Dante's mind.  See ^Par.~ xix., xx.)  The argument is that had mere
Reason been sufficient, such men would not be in the Limbo of
unsatisfied desire for the knowledge of God.  For they are the `masters
of those who know,' the men in whom the natural Reason rose to its
highest power.  In short, this passage is Reason's own confession that
it is unable to `traverse the illimitable way' of God, even in relation
to the comparatively humble problems which gather round the human body
in this world and the next.  We may conjecture that it is Dante's
rebuke of that scholastic pride of intellect which settled all
questions of Heaven and Earth with one omniscient glance.  On one side
of his nature he was himself a scholastic, as we shall have good reason
yet to know; but he was also a mystic and saw clearly the limits of
mere dialectics.  There is a mysteriously beautiful passage in the
^Paradiso~ which brings out the two elements.  In the Heaven of the
Sun, he finds himself surrounded as with garlands by two shining
circles of Theologians, representing two distinct types of Theology --
the Dominican and the Franciscan; but he tells us that, outside of
both, on the far horizon, there flashed forth suddenly a third circle,
the `true sparkling of the Holy Ghost' -- obviously some higher,
Diviner type which his eyes were as yet unable to bear.  Virgil's
gentle rebuke in the passage before us is Dante's first hint that this
great horizon of truth exists beyond the circles of the scholastic
intellect.  It is his second great lesson in humility since he reached
the Mountain: first, the practical humility of bending under God's 
chastisement like the rush before the wave; and now the 
intellectual humility which bends as meekly before God's mystery. 
The spiritual connection between the two is probably much more 
vital than appears upon the surface.  (It must be remembered, however,
that the scholastic theology was based on this very contrast between
what lies within the natural understanding and what lies beyond it.  In
the ^Conv.~ [iv. 15], Dante quotes a passage from the ^Contra Gentiles~
[i. 5], in which the pride of intellect is rebuked: `There are many so
presumptuous of their own genius that they believe they can measure all
things [Aquinas, ^totam divinam naturam~, the whole nature of the
Godhead] with their intellect, regarding everything as true which
appears to them, and everything as false which does not so appear.' 
Aquinas adds: `In order then that the human mind might be delivered
from this presumption, and attain to a modest style of enquiry after
truth, it was necessary for certain things to be proposed to man from
God that altogether exceeded his understanding' -- ^i.e.~ the doctrines
of Faith.)
 
	|46-60.~  The Pilgrims now found themselves brought up by the base
of the mountain, a precipice so steep that the most desolate and
solitary path on the Riviera had been an easy stairway in 
comparison.  Reason is quite helpless as guide: Virgil can only 
wonder on which side the slope may be, for nothing short of wings 
would avail here.  As they stand in doubt, Virgil examining the 
path below and Dante searching the rocks above for an opening, 
the latter suddenly caught sight of a crowd of souls coming 
toward them from the left, but so slowly that they seemed not to 
move their feet.  This is the first of the four classes of 
penitents who are detained in Ante-Purgatory because they lack 
the energy of will necessary to begin the positive work of
self-purification.  All they have strength for is to turn away from 
sin and weaken evil habits by mere abstention from them.  It 
consists of those who died under the curse of excommunication, 
but at the eleventh hour repented and made their peace direct 
with God.  The moral effects of their spiritual obstinacy and 
defiance of the Church, however, still cling round them, and 
reveal themselves in many ways.  First, they are confined to the 
very base of the precipice, and therefore have the longest way to 
climb of any on the Mountain.  In the next place, their movement 
is so slow that they seem not to move at all -- habitual evil and 
obstinacy have almost destroyed all energy towards better things. 
Finally, they are detained here for thirty times the period of 
their defiance of the Church, to indicate that it takes this 
length of time to build up into the strength necessary for the 
purifying discipline, the wills ruined and broken down by years 
of sin and contumacy. 
 
	|67-87.~  Virgil having no counsel in himself, turned to the
slow-moving crowd for guidance, for, according to Dante, the lowest 
Christian penitent knows more of the new life than the highest 
wisdom outside the kingdom.  When the Pilgrims came to about a 
stone-cast from them, the whole crowd suddenly flung themselves 
against the cliff and stood gazing `like one who goes in doubt.' 
The reason seems to be that they see the strangers going in the 
opposite direction to themselves -- to the left, instead of the 
right.  The latter is, of course, the direction proper to 
Purgatory; but so little of inward guidance have these 
excommunicated souls that they are thrown into a panic of 
uncertainty whether, after all, their own movement to the right 
is not a mistake.  Their sin and contumacy have so destroyed the 
inner witness of conscience that they are at the mercy of what 
they see others do.  This seems to be at least one reason why 
Dante compares them to a flock of sheep.  When Virgil begs the 
`spirits elect' to tell him on which side the Mountain sloped, 
`the head of that fortunate flock' (according to Vernon, `the spirits
were fortunate in not having died in the wrath of God.'  But perhaps
Dr. Fearon's view comes nearer to Dante's use of the word: `Spirits in
purgatory are styled ^fortunati~, as being creatures whose condition is
not finally settled, as having still much to undergo, being subject to
much uncertainty, and dependent as to the length and severity of their
trials upon much that they cannot foresee or control [such as the
efforts made on their behalf by the living], but never ^beati~'
[^Nineteenth Century~, February 1898]) advances, and the rest follow
`like sheep', as the saying is.  The comparison is 
significant: 
 
       As the sheep come issuing from the fold 
       By one, by two, by three, and the others stand 
       All timid, bending eye and muzzle to the earth, 
       And what the foremost does the others do, 
       Huddling themselves against her if she stop, 
       Simple and quiet, and the why they know not, 
       So moving to approach us thereupon 
       I saw the leader of that fortunate flock, 
       Modest in face and dignified in gait. 

(In ^Conv.~ i. 11, Dante speaks of the sheeplike way in which men
follow one another without knowing why.)  The principal point of the
comparison is doubtless to be found in the fact of their
excommunication.  Having cast off the guidance of the Church, they are
like sheep without a shepherd.  This is why the Church is set upon the
top of the Mountain, while those who have defied her are at the very
foot, the farthest away from the means of grace she is ordained to
administer.  But probably Dante had a secondary meaning.  In their very
repentance, as in their sin, many men are like sheep, following some
great name like King Manfred, one of the leaders of this flock. 
Princes draw crowds after them for good or for evil.  Many of these
excommunicated souls would never have had the courage to brave the
anger and curse of the Church, but for the defiance hurled at her by
men like Manfred; and those who followed him in his sin now follow him
in his repentance with the same sheeplike 
imitation.  It is part of the punishment of their contumacy that 
they are not yet able to follow the true `Shepherd and Bishop of 
their souls'. 
 
	|88-93.~  When the front line of this flock of sheep caught sight
of Dante's shadow which stretched in front of him as far as the cliff,
they drew back in alarm, and those behind caught the contagion of their
fear without knowing why.  It is the counterpart of Dante's own fear a
few minutes before: ^they~ are as much alarmed because he cast a shadow
as ^he~ had been because Virgil cast none.  As already pointed out, the
idea seems to be that `there is a natural body and there is a spiritual
body,' and each is normal to itself. 
 
	|101.~  We saw that the souls of the Excommunicate paused in 
doubt when they saw the strangers going leftwards.  They now 
recover themselves sufficiently to inform them that they must 
retrace their steps.

	|103-123.~  And then follows a very beautiful and significant
incident.  As Dante was departing, one of the leaders of the flock
begged him to turn and say whether he had ever seen him in the other
world.  The passage is long, but since it is one of the most famous in
the poem, it is necessary to quote it in full in order to bring out the
many points of importance it contains: 
 
       I turned me to him, and steadfastly regarded him: 
       Fair-haired was he and beautiful and of noble aspect; 
       But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided. 
       When with humility I had disclaimed 
       E'er having seem him, he said, `Now look'; 
       And he showed me high upon his breast a wound. 
       Then said he with a smile: `I am Manfredi, 
       The grandson of the Emperess Costanza; 
       Therefore I pray thee when thou dost return, 
       Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother 
       Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's, 
       And tell the truth to her, if aught else be told. 
       After that I had my body broken 
       By two mortal stabs, I yielded myself up 
       Weeping to Him who willingly doth pardon. 
       Horrible my iniquities had been; 
       But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms, 
       That it receives whate'er turns back to it. 
       If the pastor of Cosenza, who to the chase 
       Of me was sent by Clement, had then 
       In God but duly read this page, 
       The bones of my dead body still would be 
       At the bridge-head near unto Benevento, 
       Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn. 
       Now the rain washes them, and the wind moves, 
       Beyond the Realm, almost beside the Verde, 
       Where he transported them with tapers quenched. 
       By their malediction one is not so lost 
       That the Eternal Love cannot return, 
       So long as hope has any bloom of green. 
       True is it that whosoe'er in contumacy dies 
       Of Holy Church, though he repents at last, 
       Must wait upon the outside of this bank 
       Thirtyfold for all the time that he has been 
       In his presumption, unless such decree 
       Shorter by means of righteous prayers become. 
       See now if thou hast power to make me joyful, 
       By making known unto my good Costanza 
       How thou hast seen me, and this ban as well, 
       For those on earth can much advance us here.' 
 
The speaker is Manfred, King of Apulia and Sicily, natural son of 
the great Emperor, Frederick II., whom men called `stupor mundi.' 
Dante's description of him shows that he felt the universal 
fascination of the unfortunate prince.  `In the annals of that 
great family,' writes Dr. Moore, `there is no name surrounded by 
such a halo of tragic interest -- not even that of the great 
Frederick himself, unapproachable as he is in the loftiness of 
his genius and character -- as that of Manfred, "il bello e 
biondo," whom his rough soldiers, whether Saracen or Norman, 
loved with almost feminine enthusiasm; whose name still lives in 
the traditional folk-lore of the uninstructed peasants of "the 
land of Manfred"; whose tragic fate has inspired one of the most 
touching and splended episodes in the divine poem of Dante' (from a
review of a very interesting book, ^The Land of Manfred~ by Janet Ross
[^Edinburgh Review~, July 1889]). 
 
Notice, first, one or two subordinate points.  It is 
somewhat strange to find Manfred asking Dante is he had ever seen 
him on earth.  This was obviously impossible, since the poet was 
born only the year before Manfred was slain at the battle of 
Benevento in 1266.  The meaning, whatever it is, is generally 
connected with the fact that at the time of his death Manfred as 
about thirty-five, exactly Dante's age when he climbed the 
Mountain.  The idea seems to be, as Scartazzini says, either that 
Dante looked much older than he was, or that Manfred, forgetting 
that he had been wandering on the Mount for four-and-thirty 
years, mistook him for a contemporary. 
 
It is worth while noticing also that while the purgatorial body of
Manfred is too ethereal to cast a shadow, it yet retains the
fair-haired beauty of the earthly form and the very wounds which struck
him down in his last wild charge at Benevento.  The suggestion is
frequently made that Dante had in mind the fact that the wounds of our
Lord were still visible in His resurrection body.  (Dr. Charles says
the same idea is found in the Biblical conception of Sheol.  `Those
slain with the sword bore forever the tokens of a violent death [Ezek.
xxxii. 25], as likewise those who died from grief [Gen. xlii. 38]. 
Indeed the departed were regarded as possessing exactly the same
features as marked them at the moment of death.  We can appreciate,
accordingly, the terrible significance of David's departing counsel to
Solomon touching Joab: "Let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in
peace" [I K. ii. 6].' -- ^Encyclopaedia Biblica~, `Eschatology,' 16).
 
It is somewhat curious, too, the way in which Manfred 
avoids all mention of his father, although he was his favourite 
son (`Manfred was the favourite son of Frederick II., and is described
by the anonymous historian of his reign as "Manfredus, id est manus
Frederici; Minfredus, minor Fredericius; Monfredus, mons Frederici"'
[^The Land of Manfred~ by Janet Ross, p. 7).  One almost expects him to
say proudly: `I am the son of the great Emperor, the Second Frederick'
instead of 
 
         `I am Manfred, 
       The grandson of the Emperess Costanza.' 
 
It is probably in part Dante's kindly and delicate way of quietly 
passing over the fact that he was not born in wedlock; but the 
fundamental reason is doubtless his father's general character 
and doom.  Manfred evidently shrinks from allying himself with 
one who lies in a fiery tomb in the City of Dis for heresy: he 
may even regard this as ending the relationship.  As himself on 
the way to Paradise, he prefers to claim kinship, natural and 
spiritual, with his grandmother Constance, whom Dante sets in the 
Heaven of the Moon (^Par.~ iii. 118).  Benvenuto da Imola mades a
somewhat whimsical comment on the words to the effect that `Manfred
speaks as did the mule, who on being asked by the lion whose son he
was, replied: "I am the grandson of the horse," although he was the 
son of the ass' (quoted in Vernon's ^Readings on the Purgatorio~, i.
115).  This is a piece of flippancy, of course, but Dante takes it more
seriously.  Speaking in the ^Convito~ of the four ages of man, he says
Shame, as the fear of disgrace to ourselves and our kindred, is
appropriate to the period of Adolescence; and he gives an instance from
Statius: `When Polynices was questioned by King Adrastus of his origin,
he hesitated before speaking, for shame of the fault he had 
committed against his father, and further for the faults of 
OEdipus his father, which seemed to leave their trace in the 
shame of the son.  And he did not mention his father, but his 
ancestors and his land and his mother' (^Conv.~ iv. 25 [Wicksteed's
Transl.]; see also Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 1st Series, p. 252). 
This almost parallel case proves that it is not by accident Manfred
omits his father's name: it is connected with this sense of shame which
shrinks from family dishonour. 
 
The repentance of Manfred ^in articulo mortis~ is, of 
course, pure fiction.  Falling in the rush of battle, and his 
body not recovered for three days, no one can have known his last 
thoughts.  Dante's sombre imagination loved to play round the 
death of men and women whose life went out in mystery, until it 
reconstructed the final crisis and tragedy of the soul as it 
passed from world to world: Francesca, Ulysses, Ugolino, Count 
Guido of Montefeltro and his son Buonconte, will readily occur as 
instances.  The suggestion of Manfred's repentance may have come 
from the well-known incident of his helmet.  When he saw that the 
battle was lost through the treachery of the Apulian barons, he 
scorned the advice of his men to flee, and resolved to die upon 
the field.  As he placed his helmet on his head, his crest, the 
silver eagle which was the symbol of the Empire, fell down on the 
saddlebow before him, and he exclaimed, `^Ecce, Signum 
Domini~!'  (Villani's ^Chronicle~, vii. 9; Gregorovius, v. 383ff.
[English Transl.].  In ^Inf.~ xxviii. 16 Dante refers to the barons'
treachery: `At Ceperano where each Apulian was false.'  Manfred posted
them on the bridge of Ceperano over the Liris, but they turned traitors
and allowed Charles of Anjou to cross without resistance.  There was
therefore no fighting at Ceperano, though Dante speaks as if there had
been.)  Dante many have welcomed this exclamation as a sign of
penitence at the last hour, submission to God's will.  The 
truth is, however, that Dante was not unwilling to use Manfred 
and his repentance to show the limits of the Church's power to 
^condemn~, in precisely the same way as he had used the perdition 
of Guido da Montefeltro to show the limits of her power to 
^pardon~ (^Inf.~ xxvii).  It may be for this reason that Manfred's
wickedness is put at its full value: 
 
       `Horrible my iniquities had been.' 
 
It is difficult to say what lies behind these words.  If Villani 
is to be believed, Manfred put to death his brother Henry's sons 
in prison; had his father smothered with a bolster; and bribed 
the physicians to poison his brother, Conrad IV.; and he sums up 
his general character in the following words: `He was beautiful 
in person, and, like his father, but even more, dissolute in 
every fashion; a musician he was, and singer, and loved to see 
around him buffoons and minstrels, and beautiful concubines, and 
was always clad in green raiment; very liberal was he, and 
courteous, and gracious, so that he was much loved and in great 
favour; but all his life he was an epicurean, caring neither for 
God nor the saints, but only for bodily delights.  An enemy he 
was to Holy Church, and to priests and monks, occupying the 
churches as his father had done' (Villani's ^Chronicle~, vi. 46
[Selfe's Transl.]; for the crimes attributed to Manfred, see vi. 22,
41, 44, 45).  Doubtless much of this istrue, since Dante, who had a
sincere admiration for him and his father as enlightened and cultured
princes, appears to have believed it (^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, 1. 12);
but Manfred is singularly fortunate if some of the charges were not
made by the Church and the Guelphs to blacken the character of an
excommunicated man.  There certainly must have been another side to his
character if, as Gregorovius says, `the best of his contemporaries,
numbers of the Guelf party themselves, saw in him the flower of perfect
manhood; extolled his generous magnanimity, the gentle nobility of his
manners, his fine culture, and his greatness of soul, which rarely
betrayed him into a mean or angry action' (^Rome in the Middle Ages~,
v. 395 [English Translation]).  But, as already said, his wickedness is
put at its full value in order to bring out more clearly the triumph of
God's grace alike over the curse of the Church and the worst depravity
of the human heart.  At the last moment, struck down in the roar of
battle, kingdom, life, everything lost at one blow, weeping he gave
himself to God; and 
now he smiles to think how in that one decisive moment guilt and 
curse fell off him like a cloak, and Heaven was won: 
 
       `Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms 
       That it receives whate'er turns back to it.' 

It is all past: the ban, wounds, defeat, death, all the tragedy 
of his short, sinful, stormy life, are now but matter for a happy 
smile.  (Manfred smiles in the act of showing Dante the fatal wound he
received at Benevento -- vv. 110-112.)
 
	|124-135.~  The story of the finding of Manfred's body as told by
Villani has a peculiar vividness and pathos which may justify 
another quotation: `At his end, search was made for Manfred for 
more than three days, and he could not be found, and it was not 
known if he was slain, or taken, or escaped, because he had not 
borne royal insignia in the battle; at last he was recognizd by 
one of his own camp-followers by sundry marks on his person, in 
the midst of the battle-field; and his body being found by the 
said camp-follower, he threw it across an ass he had and went his 
way crying, "Who buys Manfred?  Who buys Manfred?"  And one of 
the King's barons chastised this fellow and brought the body of 
Manfred before the King, who caused all the barons which had been 
taken prisoners to come together, and having asked each one if it 
was Manfred, they all timidly said Yes.  When Count Giordano 
came, he smote his hands against his face, weeping and crying: 
"Alas, alas, my lord," wherefor he was commended by the French.' 
The hatred of the Church pursued his very bones.  As an 
excommunicaed man he could not lie in consecrated ground.  He was 
buried at the head of the bridge at Benevento, and each soldier 
of the French army threw a stone on the body in honour of his 
heroic spirit.  By command of Clement IV., Bishop Pignatelli of 
Cosenza dragged the body from its resting-place, transported it 
`with quenched tapers' beyond the boundaries of the Kingdom of 
Naples, and flung it out on the banks of the river Verde (^Chronicle~,
vii. 9).  The very name of this river calls up to Manfred the whole
symbolism of eternal Hope.  It is usually identified with the Liris or
Garigliano, which received its name of Verde, green, from the colour of
its waters.  It was Manfred's favourite colour in which he was always
clad, and the very name of the river was a good omen that even the
Church's curse was powerless to prevent the return of the Eternal Love,

 
       `So long as Hope has any bloom of green' (verde). 
 
The play upon the word is as if he were saying: `Well indeed did 
the Church act when she chose the banks of the Verde on which to 
fling my bones, for its green waters are symbolic of Hope, and 
while Hope has one pulse of life left, the Love of God can save 
the worst.  She may quench the tapers, but to quench the eternal 
grace lies beyond her power.'  The name is exactly the kind of 
hint on which a mind like Dante's would love to fasten.  (The way in
which Despair turns the soul into stone is represented by the cry of
the Furies [Remorse]: `Come Medusa, so will we make him into stone' --
literally enamel, ^smalto~ [^Inf.~ ix. 52).
 
	|136-141.~  Nevertheless, while Dante thus denies the power of the
Church to `bind or loose' apart from a man's moral and spiritual 
state (^De Mon.~ III. 8), he holds that persistent obstinacy and
defiance of the Church carries in it its own punishment -- a
semi-paralysis of will which detains the soul thirty times the period
of its contumacy.  The idea that Dante fears he has gone too far in his
opposition to the Church and now makes this compromise with its 
authority, does him but scant justice (Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~,
2nd Series, p. 11).  The true reason is to be found in the two-fold
conception of the Church which he sets before us on the Mountain-top. 
He first causes the ideal Church to pass before us in holy procession,
and then shows us the ideal sinking into a `harlot' Church, which
usurps the true Bride's place.  Now, it is this corrupt and fallen
Church which pronounced the decree of excommunication on these souls;
and if Manfred and the rest had to deal with it and it alone, it is
scarcely conceivable that Dante would have punished them with this
thirtyfold detention.  In the ^Paradiso~ (xviii. 127-130), he accuses
the Papal Court of using the power of `witholding the 
bread' as a mere weapon of war, and of passing decrees of 
excommunication in order to extort money to cancel them.  If this 
were all, it might be a virtue rather than a sin to defy such a 
Church.  But to Dante, rightly or wrongly, it is by no means all. 
In the last resort, it is not with that corrupt Church men have 
to do, but with the invisible ideal Church which his spiritual 
imagination saw moving behind it in `the beauty of holiness.' 
From it came all the sacraments and means of grace which the 
fallen Church administered.  It is a dogma of the Church itself, 
that no unworthiness of its ministers is able to invalidate those 
sacraments: `light of the sun, or even of a lamp,' as St. 
Augustine says, `when shed abroad through foul places, contracts 
nothing vile thereby.  And can Christ's baptism be contaminated 
by any one's crimes?'  (Aquinas [^Summa~, iii. q. lxiv, a. 5] says, the
minister being a mere instrument, his goodness or badness is of no
account -- a physician may cure, whether his body is well or ill, and
a pipe can convey water whether it be silver or lead.)  The serious
thing therefore about contumacy was that it cut the soul off from the
ideal Church and its sacraments, and thereby deprived it of those
Divinely ordained means of grace which Dante believed to be, not indeed
absolutely essential to salvation, but among the highest aids to the
living of the spiritual life.  This deprivaton has two 
pernicious and evil issues in the character.  In the first place, 
it leaves the soul without moral guidance.  These penitents are, 
as we saw, like sheep without a shepherd.  Having no inner 
guidance of conscience they follow one another blindly and are 
thrown into a panic of moral doubt when they see the two 
strangers moving to the left.  In the second place, it creates a 
weakening of the will which amounts almost to paralysis.  A habit 
of spiritual defiance nourished for years, even when the attitude 
of defiance is abandoned, remains in the soul as a spiritual 
informity, an inability of the will to rouse itself to the toil 
and discipline of self-purification. 
 
	|142-146.~  One thing alone can shorten this thirtyfold period of
detention -- the prayer of righteous souls upon the earth.  King 
Manfred begs Dante to tell his daughter, `my good Constance,' 
that he is not finally lost, as his excommunication had probably 
led her to believe, and that her prayers can hasten his 
deliverance from Ante-Purgatory.  The subject of prayers for the 
dead must be more carefully examined when we reach Canto VI.  Meantime
it is enough to say that Dante does not conceive of 
prayer for the dead as operating in any mechanical or non-spiritual
manner.  If the long period of delay at the base of the Mountain
represents, as we have seen, the natural moral weakness produced in the
soul by years of presumptuous contumacy, there is nothing arbitrary or
mechanical in the idea that this infirmity of the will may be removed,
in part at least, by the effectual fervent prayers of righeous men on
earth.  At all events, if there is, it would render equally useless our
prayers for one another in this present world.  `As we are taught that
we may offer intercessory prayers for our living friends that they may
profit by God's dispensations of sorrow, pain, warning, or
encouragement, so assuredly would Dante hold, believing vividly as he
did in "the Communion of Saints," that this privilege and duty extended
also to the discipline of those who have gone before, that discipline
being but the continuation and the 
"filling up of that which is lacking" in the discipline of this 
life' (Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 53; comp. ^Purg.~
xi. 70-72).
