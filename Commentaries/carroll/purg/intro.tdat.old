Protestant readers, unable to accept a threefold division
of the world to come, may be excused if they approach the
<i>Purgatorio</i> with the feeling that its chief ethical interest and
value must be confined to members of Dante's own Church. 
Fortunately it is not necessary for our present purpose to
entangle ourselves in the polemics of the subject, for the simple
reason that Dante assures us that the whole poem has a meaning
for this world as well as for the next. In his Epistle to Can
Grande he writes: 'The subject, then, of the whole work, taken
according to the letter alone, is simply a consideration of the
state of souls after death; for from and around this the action
of the whole work turneth. But if the work is considered
according to its allegorical meaning, the subject is man, liable
to the reward or punishment of justice, according as through the
freedom of the will he is deserving of understanding' [<i>Epis</i>. x. 8
(Latham's Translation)]. This allegorical or moral sense
manifestly covers both worlds: as indeed is implied in the fact
that Dante himself climbed the Mountain, and underwent its
purifying discipline, while still clothed in 'the flesh of Adam'
[<i>Purg.</i> xi. 44]. Nor is this a mere poetic fiction forced upon
him by the exigencies of the work; on the contrary, it is in
accordance with the teaching of the Church that the cleansing pain
of Purgatory in another world is rendered necessary because sinners
shrink from it in this. On the First Terrace, for example, one of
the penitents confesses his sin of Pride, and adds:
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
'And here must I this burden bear for it
Till God be satisfied, <i>since I did not</i>
<i>Among the living</i>, here among the dead.'
[<i>Purg.</i> xxi. 70-72.]
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
The meaning is clear. Since the cleansing discipline ought to be
undergone here and now, we are justified in reading the
<i>Purgatorio</i>, according to Dante's allegorical sense, as the
process by which the soul may purify itself while still in the
flesh. This, as Dean Church says, brings this division of the
poem much nearer our common experience than either the <i>Inferno</i>
or the <i>Paradiso</i>: 'The <i>Purgatorio</i> is a great parable of the
discipline on earth of moral agents, of the variety of their
failures and needs, of the variety of their remedies. We
understand the behaviour of those who are undergoing their
figurative processes of purification. They labour as men do who
feel the influence of the Spirit of God striving with their evil
tendencies and lifting them up to purer and nobler things. We
understand their resignation, their thankful submission to the
chastisement which is to be the annealing to strength and peace. 
We understand their acquiescence and faith in the justice which
appoints and measures their 'majestic pains.' We understand the
aim and purpose which sustain them, the high-hearted courage
which endures, the steady hope which knows that all is well. 
There is nothing transcendental in all this; nothing but what
experience helps us easily to imagine; nothing but what good men,
always on the way to be better, have gone through on the scene of
life' [Introduction to Vernon's <i>Readings on the Purgatorio</i>, p.
xiii]. In short, on any theory of the future world, the struggle
against the Seven Deadly Sins is not a thing which it is safe to
postpone; and the process by which a great poet, a great
theologian, and a great penitent like Dante believed they could
be finally vanquished, ought surely to be a subject of the utmost
interest to every man who knows he sins and longs for purity.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
In form, plan, and situation, Dante's conception of
Purgatory stands in striking contrast to that current in his day. 
He departs entirely from the teaching of his master in theology,
St. Thomas Aquinas. According to the great schoolman, neither
Reason nor Scripture give material for determining the place of
Purgatory; but the probability is that it is divided into two
parts: one 'according to common law,' where ordinary cases are
purged in an underground prison, which, though not actually in
Hell, is so closely connected with it that the same fires burn in
both; another, 'according to dispensation,' where special cases
are punished in divers places, 'either for the instruction of the
living or the relief of the dead' [<i>Summa</i>, iii. App. to Suppl.,
<i>De Purgatorio</i>, a. 2]. Speaking generally, some such conception
as this prevails in the visions of Purgatory in which the Middle
Ages were so prolific. Alberic, Tundal, Owain, the Monk of
Evesham, Thurcill, and many others, profess to have received
revelations of a dark and awful Purgatory of ice, fire, and demonic
tortures, so terrifying that not unnaturally they often mistook it
for a worse place [see <i>Forerunners of Dante</i> by Marcus Dods, chap.
vi]. This gloomy underground conception Dante deliberately set
aside, lifting his Purgatory serenely into the sunlight and the
blue sky in the form of a great Mountain, the highest under the
heaven, and the direct antipodes of Mount Calvary. This bold
open-air treatment is no caprice; it is essential to his whole
conception of the object to be accomplished. That object is to
undo the Fall, to bring man back to the original state of natural
righteousness, consisting of the four cardinal virtues, Prudence,
Justice, Temperance, Fortitude. These <i>natural</i> virtues must be
regained before the soul can pass on and up to the <i>supernatural</i>
virtues, Faith, Hope, Love, without which the Beatific Vision is
impossible. It is for this reason that Dante sets the Earthly
Paradise, the Garden of Eden, on the lofty summit of Mount
Purgatory; and the long and arduous ascent from Terrace to Terrace
is simply the undoing of the Fall, the human soul climbing its
painful way back to the fourfold virtue on which the natural life
turns as on a hinge.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
A second symbolism springs from this. These natural
virtues imply society, and society in that free, ordered, and
happy state which nothing but righteous government can secure. 
To Dante, as his <i>De Monarchia</i> shows, this meant a universal
Empire under one head; and of this, the Earthly Paradise on the
Mountain-top is the symbol. This in its turn was but the prelude
to the Celestial Paradise; hence the great Procession of
Revelation must meet the penitent soul to add the supernatural
virtues to the natural, and thus prepare it for the final
blessedness. It is obvious that this scheme of symbolism would
be quite impossible in some dark world underground, next door to
Hell, and scored by its flames.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
This, then, is the leading idea, and it lends itself
easily to the carrying out of the symbolism of purfication in
many other directions. The origin of the Mountain itself is
probably an allegory. When Satan fell on the southern side of
the earth, the land there fled to the other hemisphere, and the
waters rushed in to fill the vacant space. The soil displaced as
he tore his way to the centre of the earth, was flung up behind
him by the shock, and formed this Mountain [<i>Inf.</i> xxxiv. 121-126]. 
In other words, the fall of Satan which ruined Eden, threw up, by
a kind of moral recoil, a pathway of return to the lost Garden, and
so far the great Adversary defeated himself. It represents perhaps
that mysterious 'soul of goodness in things evil' in virtue of
which even sin bears within its bosom something of its own cure. 
Further, the Mountain-form made it possible so to arrange upon
its sides the Seven Deadly Sins as to indicate at once their
relative distances from God and the order in which they must be
faced and conquered. The precipices at the base, with their
tortuous clefts, are natural symbols of the strait gate and narrow
way at the beginning of the new life; while the lessening of the
pain and toil as Terrace after Terrace is won, represents the
increasing ease and joy of right living which every self-conquest
brings. Still further, by this open-air treatment Dante gained
the aid of the healing powers of Nature, powers which grow purer
and more Divine as the soul climbs higher and higher out of evil. 
Above all, he was able to invest the entire Mountain from base to
summit with the sunshine and atmosphere of Hope, in contrast to
the dark inscription of Despair above the Gate of the Inferno. 
The penitents are, indeed, prisoners, but 'Prisoners of Hope,'
who know that in due time the long exile will be past, and they
will stand, each in his appointed place, in the Eternal
Fatherland. To say, as a recent commentator does [</>An English
Commentary</> by Rev. H. F. Tozer, M.A., p. 192], that this
open-air situation of Purgatory is due to the 'demands of poetic
treatment' for the sake of a contrast to the gloom of the
Inferno, is totally inadequate. Doubtless the poetic beauty of
the work is greatly increased by this contrast; but the far
deeper and truer reason is that it is inherent in Dante's entire
conception of the moral ends to be accomplished and of the whole
process of purification.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
We come now to the moral and physical structure, which it
will be well to have clearly before our minds from the outset,
even at the risk of some repetition when we reach the detailed
exposition. The following statement should be compared carefully
with the Diagram of the Mount which faces the title-page {omitted}.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
The Mountain is divided into three great sections, each
of which represents a distinct stage of the purgatorial
discipline: Ante-Purgatory, Purgatory Proper, and the Earthly
Paradise. 
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
I. ANTE-PURGATORY
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
This division consists of the base of the Mountain, which
is occupied by souls that postponed repentance till the eleventh
hour. The long delay has created a semi-paralysis of will-power,
which renders them morally incapable of beginning their
self-purification at once. They can only starve their evil habits
into weakness by abstaining from those acts which nourished them
for a lifetime. Four classes are distinguished.
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
I. <i>The Excommunicate.</i>
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
Their defiance of the Church to the eleventh hour has
produced in these souls a moral paralysis which detains them
thirty times the period of their contumacy, setting them at the
very base of the Mountain, farthest from God, and with the
longest distance to climb.
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
II. <i>The Indolent.</i>
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
These are not to be confounded with the Slothful on the
Fourth Terrace, who pursued goodness, but pursued it slackly. The
Indolent simply ignored the claims of goodness to the end of life
through sheer laziness of nature. Having died a natural death,
they received the full period of repentance. Their indolence
still clings round them, detaining them for the period of their
life on earth.
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
III. <i>The Energetic.</i>
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
This class differs from the last in two respects: (1)
they died by violence, and therefore had not the full natural
period for repentance; and (2) the very activity of their earthly
life was the cause of their delay. It still detains them: they
move with the swiftness of shooting stars and summer lightning.
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
IV. <i>Negligent Wordly Princes.</i>
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
These are seated in a Flowery Valley, secluded from
vulgar eyes -- symbolic of the earthly rank and pomp for which
they neglected the welfare of their souls. They are set higher
up the Mountain, perhaps because the greatness of their
temptations forms some palliation of their delay.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
The last three classes are detained as many years as they
postponed repentance, unless the period is shortened by holy
prayers. Hence Ante-Purgatory is described as the place
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
Where time by time restores itself.
[<i>Purg.</i> xxiii. 84.] 
</pre><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
II. PURGATORY PROPER.
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
This division occupies the rest of the Mountain with the
exception of the table-land upon the summit. The only entrance
is St. Peter's Gate, guarded by an Angel-Confessor. The three
steps which lead up to it represent the three parts of the
Sacrament of Penance -- Confession, Contrition, Satisfaction. 
The Gate opens only to the golden key of authority and the silver
key of knowledge.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
Inside the Gate the Mountain is cut into Seven Terraces,
on each of which one of the Seven Deadly Sins is purged away. 
Since Purgatory, unlike the Inferno, deals not with acts, but
simply with evil dispositions remaining in the soul, all the sins
are traced to some disorderment of Love, according to the
following classification: 
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
&lang;pre&rang;
Terrace I. Pride. | I. Love Distorted -- the desire
Terrace II. Envy. | to inflict some injury 
Terrace III. Anger. | on our neighbour
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
| II. Love Defective -- a weak, 
Terrace IV. Accidia. | indolent desire after the good.
</pre><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
| III. Love Excessive -- the im-
Terrace V. Avarice. | moderate desire for things
Terrace VI. Gluttony. | not positively wrong in
Terrace VII. Sensuality. | themselves.
&lang;/pre&rang;
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
This classification of the Seven Deadly Sins and the
discipline by which they are conquered will become clearer if we
keep the following points in mind:
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(1) Sins of the spirit -- Pride, Envy, Anger -- are set
farthest down the Mountain, and sins of the flesh highest --
Avarice, Gluttony, Sensuality: to indicate their relative
distances from God. The central sin of Accidia, as partaking of
the nature of both, is set as a transition vice between the two
groups.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(2) On every Terrace, the penitents are represented as
entangled in the residue of sinful habit: the Proud still need to
have their haughty necks humbled; the Envious have their eyes
sewed up; the Angry are enveloped in the smoke of their blind
passion; and so on.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(3) This residue of sin is wrought out of the soul by the
constant practice of good deeds -- a vice by its opposite virtue.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(4) On every Terrace, a twofold subject of meditation is
set before the penitents: great examples of the virtue to be won,
as a 'whip' to urge them on in pursuit of it; and great examples
of the vice to be crushed, as a 'bridle' to hold them back from
the spiritual ruin it creates.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(5) On every Terrace save one, Accidia, a prayer is
given.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(6) All up the Mount, from base to summit, the penitents
are aided by the Holy Scriptures and the Hymns and Offices of
the Church. When a soul is freed from any sin, it is hailed with
the Beatitude of the virtue won.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(7) The entire Mountain is under the guardianship of
Angels. Each Terrace has its Angelic Warder, who represents the
virtue to be won upon it. In this Dante departs entirely from
the usual mediaeval visions of Purgatory, which are rendered
hideous by the presence of foul demons as tormentors of the
penitents.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(8) on every Terrace, the souls accept joyfully 'the
sweet wormwood of the torments.' The only sign of perfect purity
is their own desire to depart. When any soul is finally
purified, the Mountain shakes, and all the spirits chant the
<i>Gloria in excelsis</i> for their brother's deliverance.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
(9) The function of Virgil in the <i>Purgatorio</i> requires
some special notice. As the Natural Reason he was able to guide
Dante through Hell, for the natural intellect and conscience know
sin and its inevitable issues. When the poet enters the
Christian Purgatory, however, it might be thought that he would
part company with his heathen guide. But he saw no reason for
doing so. He regarded Virgil as a prophet of Christianity. In
his Fourth Eclogue he was believed to have foretold the Advent of
the Christ; and the passage in the Sixth of the <i>AEneid</i> quoted
at the beginning of this Introduction must have seemed to Dante
almost a Divine revalation of the Purgatory of the Church:
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
'Nay but, even when life with the last light has fled,
Not yet departeth every ill from the unhappy dead,
Nor yet are they quite quit of all the fleshly stains;
For deep within it needs must be that many a thing remains,
Long grown with the soul itself, in fashion wonderful.
Therefore are they plied with pains, and render back in full
The torments of their ancient sins. Some, hung up on high
Are stretched out to be the empty winds; some have sin's 
deep dye
Washed clean beneath a whirlpool vast, or by the fire
out-brent.
We bear each one our ghostly weird: thereafter are we sent
Through wide Elysium, and, a few, the Happy Fields we roam.
Till the long day, the orb of Time running full circle home,
Has taken out the concrete stain, and left all pure and fair
The sense ethereal, and the fire of unpolluted air.'
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
Dante must have felt that the man who could thus anticipate the
doctrine of the Church was not unworthy to be his guide to 'the
Happy Fields' on the Mountain-top. At the same time, he recognizes
that Virgil is far from being as familiar with the penitent life
as with the world of the lost. At first he scarcely knows
whether to turn to the right hand or to the left. Again and
again he has to ask his way, and lean on the guidance of the
penitents themselves. At different points, Sordello and Statius
become his guides; on the summit Matelda supersedes him; and when
Beatrice, symbol of Divine Revelation, descends, he suddenly
vanishes before the higher wisdom. 
</p><pre class=""commentaryindented"">
III. THE EARTHLY PARADISE.
</pre><p class=""commentarytext"">
This final division consists of a great table-land on the
summit of the Mountain, covered with a 'Divine forest,' in
obvious contrast to the dark and savage wood in which Dante lost
himself at the beginning of the <i>Commedia</i>. We have seen that it
represents the Garden of Eden, symbol of just government.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
In the midst stands a great Tree, bare of leaves and
flowers -- the Tree of Empire, withered up and barren through the
Fall. It must be kept in mind that almost the entire symbolism
of this part of the <i>Purgatorio</i> gathers round the relations
between Church and Empire. The narrative passes through four
principal movements.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
I. The Procession of the Spirit in Revelation -- the
Books of Scripture with the Chariot of the Church in the centre. 
The Chariot is drawn by a Gryphon, representing Christ; and on
the Car descends Beatrice, as the Bride, the Spirit of
Revelation.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
II. The Judgment of Dante. Beatrice refuses to unveil
and reveal her beauty till Dante makes full confession of his
unfaithfulness to her. After confession, Matelda, the Active
Life, draws him through Lethe, and he forgets his sins.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
III. Seven Visions of the History of Church and Empire
pass before his eyes, ending with the carrying away of the
Papacy to Avignon in 1305.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
IV. The Final Purification of Dante. He has now learnt
from Beatrice the one great lesson of the Earthly Paradise --
the true, ideal relations between Church and Empire, and must
pass on to the higher revelations of the Celestial Paradise. For
these, one thing is necessary: the quickening of his memory of
good deeds. Matelda therefore makes him drink of Eunoë, which
renews his soul and prepares him to mount among the stars.
</p><p class=""commentarytext"">
One final remark. The first impression of a Protestant
reader is, perhaps, that this long purifying discipline is
carried out by man's own unaided strength, independently of
Divine grace. Nothing could be farther from Dante's thought. 
The foundation on which the whole process is even possible, is
the salvation wrought out by Christ. This is implied on the
Terraces and lower slopes of the Mountain in the constant use of
Scripture and of the Hymns and Offices of the Church; and it
becomes explicit on the summit when the great Procession of
Revelation appears in the form of the Cross, with the Chariot of
the Church as its centre, drawn by Christ Himself in His twofold
nature. Assuredly Dante had no idea that man has any natural
ability to save himself: from first to last, he knew that
'salvation belongeth unto the Lord.'
