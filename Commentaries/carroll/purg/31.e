	|1-36.~  We come now to the second part of the impeachment, in
which the point of the sword is turned straight on Dante himself. 
Addressing him as one still on the far side of `the sacred river,' and
therefore with full memory of his sins, Beatrice peremptorily demands
his confession: let him say at once if the charge is true.  In his
confusion Dante cannot find his voice; and a second time comes the
demand, with the reminder that `the sad memories' have not yet been
effaced by the water of Lethe.  This time he manages to falter forth a
`Yes' so feebly that the sight was necessary to catch it; and, as a bow
breaks when overdrawn, he burst into a torrent of tears and sighs, and
his voice failed in its passage.  His grief does not seem to soften
Beatrice.  She demands the cause of his unfaithfulness: was it
something within the very desire of her, some trench in the way, or
some entangling chain, which made him lose hope of ever reaching the
Highest Good to which she was leading him?  And as to the others for
whom he abandoned her, what pleasures or profits did they carry on the
brow, that he had to `promenade' before them?  [As Butler says, no
satisfactory explanation has been given to the words `lor passegiare
anzi' (v. 30).  Various translations are suggested: `to walk toward
them'; `to walk in front of them,' as a servant before his master; to
woo them'; `to pay court to them,' etc.]  Then at last with bitter sobs
and tears he falters forth his confession:

                         `The present things
     With their false pleasure turned away my steps,
     Soon as your countenance concealed itself.'

	|37-48.~  Now, for the first time, Beatrice softens.  Silence or
denial would not have made his sin less, she says, but confession turns
the wheel back against the edge of the sword, in the Court of
Heaven.  Yet in order to deepen his shame, and thus strengthen
him against the Sirens another time, she proceeds to show how her
death, the concealing of her face which turned him to sin, was
the very thing which would have saved him from it; or, to use her
own words,

                    `how to the contrary part
     My buried flesh ought to have moved thee.'

	|49-75.~  The argument is that when he saw how she, the fairest
thing on earth, died and left the soul deceived, he should have risen
at once above things mortal to that eternal and true life into which
she had entered:

     `Never did nature or art present to thee
     Pleasure so great as the fair members within which
     I was enclosed, and which in earth are scattered.
     And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee
     By reason of my death, what mortal thing
     Should then have drawn thee into its desire?
     Surely thou oughtest, at the first arrow
     Of things deceitful, to have risen up
     Behind me, who was no longer such.
     Thou shouldst not have weighed down thy wings
     To await more strokes, either young girl,
     Or other vanity of such brief use.
     The callow birdlet waits for two or three,
     But before the eyes of those full-fledged,
     A net is spread in vain or arrow shot.'

As he stands with downcast face, ashamed and penitent by mere hearing,
Beatrice commands him to lift up his beard, that sight may increase his
grief.  What he sees when he, at is were, `uprooted' his chin, must
wait until we have discussed the meaning of this severe and searching
impeachment.  The word `beard' revealed to Dante `the venom of the
argument' -- it is that `most burning word' which Beatrice was keeping
for the last.  The meaning which lies upon the surface is that his sin
had no excuse of inexperienced youth: it was committed in the full
maturity of bearded manhood.  He was five-and-twenty when she died, and
his unfaithfulness had lasted during the ten intervening years, so that
he was no mere `callow birdlet.'  But it is difficult to believe that
this, bad as it is, is all Dante means by the strong phrase, `the venom
of the argument.'  It is almost impossible for us to think of Dante
with a beard at all.  None of his portraits gives one.  Yet that he
wore a beard in the year 1300 is certain from this passage.  When did
he begin to wear it?  If Boccaccio is to be believed, immediately after
the death of Beatrice, and in consequence of it: `Now, by reason of his
weeping, and by reason of the affliction of his heart within him, and
by reason of his taking no heed to himself, he had become in outward
guise almost a savage thing to look upon; gaunt and unshaven, and
almost utterly transformed from that which afore he was wont to be; in
so much that his aspect must of force move compassion not only in his
friends, but in every other who beheld it' [see Wicksteed's ^Early
Lives of Dante~, p. 20].  This is the true `venom of the argument':
his overwhelming grief for Beatrice which had once made him `gaunt and
unshaven,' had been powerless to keep him true to her.  He dried his
tears, and trimmed his beard, and gave himself to others.  Beatrice,
who had known only the smooth young face of his `first age' which we
still see on the walls of the Bargello, notes the change in his
appearance, and by a single word touches him to the quick by reminding
him that he still bore the tokens of an ancient grief which had soon
forgotten her, and made unworthy terms with the world.

We come now to one of the most hotly disputed questions
in the ^Commedia~, the exact nature of Dante's unfaithfulness. 
Setting aside minor variations, the theories virtually reduce
themselves to two -- devotion to Philosophy to the neglect of
Theology, and a fall into an immoral course of life.  There is
really no reason why these should be pitted against each other as
if they were mutually exclusive.  It seems to me quite certain
that Dante meant to confess both, when he speaks of `the present
things' and `false pleasure' and `things deceptive'.  Take first
his devotion to Philosophy.  After the death of Beatrice, he
relates in the ^Vita Nuova~ a temptation to forget her which
assailed him in the person of the ^donna pietosa~, the Lady of
Pity referred to in last chapter.  Her very resemblance to
Beatrice helped to draw him into unfaithfulness, for she was `of
a like paleness'.  The temptation was finally broken by `a strong
visible phantasy' of Beatrice clad in the `subdued and goodly
crimson' in which he had first seen her.  `And then, this evil
desire being quite gone from me, all my thoughts turned again
unto their most excellent Beatrice.  And I say most truly that
from that hour I thought constantly of her with the whole humbled
and ashamed heart' [^Vita Nuova~, xl].

Now, this temptation is the starting-point of the ^Convito~. 
The passage in the ^Vita Nuova~ concerning this Lady of Pity had been
so grossly misunderstood that many had misfamed him of vice; and in
order to protect his good name he declares that she was the symbol of
Philosphy, into the study of which he threw himself ardently after the
death of Beatrice [^Conv.~ i. 2; ii. 2, 16; iii. 1, etc.].  Some
regard this as an ingenious veil of allegory which he draws across a
moral lapse; but, after all, it is scarcely fair to make Dante thus add
hypocrisy to vice.  That there was an actual lady, and that he
idealized her into Philosophy, I have no doubt; but there is not the
slightest reason to suppose that his love for her was anything else
than Platonic.  The extravagant terms in which he speaks of Philosophy
as `the spouse, sister, and daughter of the Emperor of Heaven,' are
just the proof of how entirely it had taken the place of Theology in
his mind.  This, then, is one element in the sin here confessed.  It is
not that Philosophy in itself is evil; the evil comes in when it
forgets its place as handmaid to Theology, and becomes a substitute for
it.  [The adherents of the philosophical view lay great stress on the
words of Beatrice about the `^scuola~' which Dante had followed
(^Purg.~ xxxiii. 85-90), and its inferiority to herself; but, if the
interpretation given below is correct, it is really a school of
Theology -- that of Aquinas -- which claimed both temporal and
spiritual power for the Papacy.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 33.64-90}].

The advocates of the philosophical theory are usually
indignant with those who see in this passage the confession of a
moral lapse.  The reason is that far too much emphasis is laid by
both sides on the `pargoletta', `the little girl,' of line 59. 
All sorts of identifications have gathered round her: Beatrice
herself, Gemma Donati, the poet's wife, the Gentucca of Canto
xxiv., the Donna Pietosa of the ^Vita Nuova~, the Pietra of the
Canzoni commonly known by that name.  All this scandal is
indignantly repelled by the advocates of the philosophical theory
as pure calumny.  Both are right, and both are wrong.  The
`paragoletta' means something, but it is certainly a mistake to
regard it as the very head and front of Dante's offending.  It is
part, but only part, of a general moral declension from his early
ideal life.  It is quite useless to deny this in face of the
confession of sin which Dante has been making all up the
Mountain.  It is true, of course, that he represents mankind;
none the less does he weave his own personal sins into the common
penitence.  On almost every Terrace there is some acknowledgement
of participation in the sin there purified.  Three in particular
stand out conspicious: Pride, Sloth, and Sensuality.  Dante bends
in sympathy with the Proud, and says that already their
punishment weighs him down.  The moment he steps on to the
Terrace of Sloth, the vice of the place seizes him and `puts his
legs in truce.'  And it is quite impossible to read the story of
his shrinking from the flames which burn away the vice of
Sensuality, without feeling that we have here the record of a
personal experience.  I have omitted Dante's words to Forese
Donati on the Terrace of Gluttony:

                    `If thou bring back to mind
     What thou with me hast been and I with thee,
     The present memory will be grievous still,'

because it is by no means certain that they refer to Gluttony.  But thy
are a plain confession of some course of evil life, in which they had
been companions [^Purg.~ xi. 73; xiii. 133-138 (Pride~); xvii. 73-75
(Sloth); xxvii. 49-51 (Sensuality); xxiii. 115-117 (Forese Donati)].

The conclusion, then, to which his own statements lead
us, is that his unfaithfulness to Beatrice was twofold --
intellectual and moral.  On the intellectual side, it meant the
substitution for a time of Philosophy for Theology, of human
Reason for a Divine Revelation.  On the moral, it meant
the yielding to the `false pleasure' of `the present things,'
despairing of the fair impossible ideal revealed in Beatrice, and
letting himself float with the current of worldly morality of his
day and generation.  His confession here on the Mountain-top is
not a new one, distinct and separate from that of the various
Terraces; it is simply the clear recognition of his memory, as it
reviews the course of his life, that the fountain-head of all his
errors, intellectual and moral alike, had been unfaithfulness to
Beatrice and to the ideal of which she was the Divine Revelation
[Dr. Moore's Essay `The Reproaches of Beatrice' (^Studies in
Dante~, 3rd Series) is a careful and moderate discussion of this
most difficult question].

	|76-90.~  Having now, therefore, traced his sins to their source,
and drunk the bitter cup of memory to the dregs, and by this
final confession set himself in an attitude of perfect openness
toward God, Dante finds a new power of vision granted to him
which grows steadily to the end of the poem.  The first veil to
be taken away is that of the flowers: when Dante with a great
struggle lifts his face at the command of Beatrice, he sees that
`those primal creatures,' the Angels, are resting from their
strewing.  If the interpretation already given is correct, the
idea is that Dante's sorrow has purged his eyes.  Coming as he
did with eager anticipations of the delight of meeting Beatrice,
he finds he is not worthy to enter into the joy with which Angels
welcome her.  It hangs between him and her like a concealing
veil, and he begins to see her more clearly when the long-looked-for
joy is turned to sorrow.  The first glace strikes him senseless to the
ground.  She is turned toward the Gryphon, the animal

     Which is one sole person in two natures.


There can be no reasonable doubt that the reference is to the union of
the human and Divine natures in Christ [v. 81; the words are
theologically very exact, so as to exclude in particular the
heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches.  Nestorius sacrificed the unity of
the person, dividing Christ into two, as Aquinas says, `the Man, who is
the Son of God by adoption, and the Son of God by nature, who is the
Word of God.'  To save the unity of person, Eutyches denied the
distinction of natures.  To quote Aquinas again, he held that `before
the union there were two distinct natures, one divine and one human;
but in the union they both met as to form one.  He said then that the
person of Christ was ^of~ two natures, but did not subsist ^in~ two
natures.'  This shows the significance of the preposition `^in~ in the
above line, and the exactness of Dante's theological knowledge.  For
the discussion of the various theories of the Incarnation, see Aquinas,
^Contra Gentiles~, Bk. iv. 27-49].  It must not be supposed that Dante
saw this union now: it forms the final revelation of the ^Paradiso~. 
It is Beatrice who sees it, and the vision renders her so beautiful
that, even under her veil and on the far side of the river, she now
surpassed her ancient self as much as on earth she had surpassed
others.  A passion of remorse seized him.  All things else that he had
loved most became most hateful to him, and he fell to the earth
vanquished,

                    and what I then became
     She knoweth who had given me the cause.

	|91-102.~  On recovering from the swoon into which his grief had
thrown him, he found himself plunged in Lethe up to the throat. 
Matelda was bending above him, saying `Hold me, hold me!'  Passing
light as a shuttle over the water, she drew him on behind her; and when
he neared `the blessed shore,' he heard `^Asperges me~' so sweetly sung
that memory failed to retain it.  `The beautiful lady' opening her arms
embraced his head, and so plunged him down that he was forced to
swallow of the water.  Finally, having drawn him out, she led him thus
bathed to `the dance of the four beautiful ones,' the four Cardinal
Virtues, each of whom covered him with her arm.

This is an allegory of the process by which the soul attains
forgetfulness of its sins.  Lethe is no mere magic draught, as it is in
heathen myth.  After the stern way in which Beatrice held the bitter
cup of evil memory to his lips till he had drained it to the dregs,
Dante knew that he could never forget his sins save by a great moral
process which created a better and purer memory.  The active life of
good deeds rouses him out of the swoon of grief into which the memory
of his sin had thrown him.  Matelda, the symbol of that life, cries
`Hold me, hold me!' because only by continuance in well-doing was there
any hope of reaching the far shore of forgetfulness.  She plunges him
up to the very throat in the water, because all the faculties of the
flesh having sinned, must now be immersed in good deeds.  She draws him
through the water lightly like a shuttle, to indicate, apparently, the
ease he attained in the doing of right.  After persevering in this life
a certain length of time, he drew near to `the blessed shore,' and
heard `^Asperges me~,' the sweet music of pure and happy memory.  [The
words `^Asperges me~' (Ps. li. 7) are used when the priest sprinkles
holy water on the altar, clergy, and people before High Mass.  Here the
idea is that it is the holy water of the good works of the active Life
(Matelda) which washes away the memory of past sins].  Then comes the
last stage.  The bodily faculties have been immersed, but the head has
remained uncleansed, the lusts of the mind.  Matelda, therefore,
embraces the head with her arms, engages all the mental faculties in
the active life of good works, and plunges them also underneath the
surface.  This completes the process of oblivion, and Dante rising as
if `born of water and of the Spirit,' enters into the joy of a life of
purer, happier memories. 

	|103-111.~  Matelda leads him, with the waters of this second
baptism still upon him, to the four Cardinal Virtues at the left wheel
of the Car.  We must not imagine, of course, that he was able to live
the active life of good works through which he has just passed, without
the virtues of Prudence, Justice, Temperance and Fortitude.  But even
Dante cannot make allegory bend to every fold and turn of life and
circumstances; and what he evidently means is that only at this point
did he enter into perfect fellowship with these virtues -- the
fellowship of their joy and protection from sin, for they received him
into their dance and covered him with their arms.  In short, it
indicates the time when the virtues of the active life became
perfectly easy to him; and the implication is that not till then is the
evil memory entirely blotted out.  We have already discussed the
probable meaning of this forgetting.  According to St. Augustine's
distinction, the memory of sin as an experience passes away, but
remains as matter of the intellect, else praise for salvation were
impossible.  However Dante may have explained it psychologically, the
point of importance is that he conceived it ethically, as the natural
result of the active life of good deeds.

The four Cardinal Virtues Dante had seen at the foot of the
Mount in the form of stars [compare St. Bernard (^Cantica Canticorum~,
Serm. xxvii.): `A holy soul, then, is a heaven, having understanding
of a ^sun~, faith for a ^moon~, and for ^stars~ countless virtues'],
for like the stars they are the rulers of man's life; but their greater
nearness on the top indicates in part the change that has passed over
them under the Christian Revelation.  On the face of a heathen man like
Cato they shone as stars from the distant heavens; but to the Christian
soul they descend as nymphs and cover it with their arms.  But whatever
their form, their function is to lead men to the eyes of Beatrice, that
is, the demonstrations of Christian Theology or Revelation.  Before the
descent of Beatrice, before the Christian Revelation was given, they
were ordained to be her handmaids.  In other words, these virtues of
the natural life are the appointed guides to the demonstrations of
revealed and supernatural truth.  But only to the demonstrations, not
the persuasions, which are the inner light of the eyes of Beatrice, the
eyes lit up with gladness of her smile.  This limitation is laid down
by Aquinas, who argues that the final happiness of man `does not
consist in the knowledge of God which is to be had by demonstration.' 
Demonstration gives a knowledge of God by negations: it shows, not
where God ^is~, but what He is ^not.~  It removes certain attributes
which are inconsistent with the conception of God, and thus sets Him
apart from other beings; but this mere negative distinction of Deity is
far removed from that final and positive knowledge of His very essence
which constitutes the Beatific Vision.  This Vision comes only by
contemplation; and the organs of contemplation are Faith, Hope, Love,
the Theological Virtues on the other side of the Car, `whose gaze is
more profound,' and to whom `the four beautiful ones' pass on the
soul.  In short, the function of the natural virtues is to create that
harmony and peace within the soul, without which contemplation is
morally impossible.  For, as Aquinas says, `to the perfection of
contemplation there is requisite... rest from the disturbing forces of
passion: that is attained by means of the moral virtues and prudence'
[^Contra Gentiles~, i. 14; iii. 37, 39].  ^Intellectually~, then,
these four virtues can only set the soul in front of the eyes of
Beatrice, the demonstrations which give a mere negative knowledge of
God; but ^morally~, but stilling the ware of human passions, they
create that state of inward peace in which, and in which alone, the
higher virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love can give the contemplation of
God which is the final happiness of man.  The point at which Dante has
arrived is the transition from the ^eyes~ of Beatrice to her ^smile~ --
from demonstration to the joyous rapture of contemplation.

	|112-117.~  Singing, then, with the gladness of a soul whose sins
are forgiven and forgotten, and all its passions laid to rest, the
four Nymphs lead Dante to the Gryphon's breast and bid him gaze
at Beatrice:

          `See that thou spare not thine eyes;
     We have set thee before the emeralds,
     Whence Love once drew his weapons for thee.'

[Contrast this injunction of the cardinal virtues not to spare his eyes
gazing at Beatrice, with the rebuke of the theological virtues, `Too
fixed!' (Canto xxxii. 9).  The idea seems to be that at Dante's present
stage his knowledge of Revelation (Beatrice) must come by the good
works of the natural virtues; the rapt contemplation of the
supernatural virtues is dangerous and may blind him.]  It is difficult
not to see in this a hint of the colour of the eyes of Beatrice the
woman, though none is mentioned in the ^Vita Nuova~ -- that peculiar
grey-green of the sea, perhaps, which we sometimes meet, and which
lightens and darkness like a falling wave.  For Dante's allegorical
purpose here, it deepens to the hue of emerald, the symbolic colour of
the very flesh and bones of Hope.  For Hope as the theological virtue
is the firm expectation that Faith will change to Sight, that the dim
types and shadows under which Revelation descends into this world will
pass away for ever in that world beyond all shadows, where we know as
we are known.  The idea, therefore, is that even the lower
demonstration of the natural virtues is full of Hope; imperfect as it
is, it feels that it carries within itself the promise and potency of
the final knowledge of Divine things.  [Green was also associated with
contemplation and with the Trinity.  In the Feast of the Trinity,
officiating priests sometimes wore green vestments (Hulme's ^Symbolism
of Christian Art~, p. 25).  White is now used.]

	|121-126.~  It is a sign of the comparatively low power of vision
Dante has yet reached that he is unable to gaze directly at the
Gryphon himself.  The mystery of the Incarnation, even though it
is, so to speak, broken up for him into animal forms, is yet
beyond the power of his spiritual sight: he can see only the
reflection of it in the emerald eyes:

     As in the glass the sun, not otherwise
     The twofold animal was beaming therewithin,
     Now with one, now with other government.
     Think, reader, if I within me marvelled
     When I saw the thing in itself stay quiet,
     And in its image it transformed itself.
     
[See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 29.106-114}.]

The meaning of this has been already discussed.  Dante is not yet able
to gaze directly at the two natures (^due nature~) of Christ; what he
can see is the two governments (^reggimenti~), of which the two natures
are the foundation.  If it be felt that this is a great fall from the
ideal heights of contemplation to which we expected to be caught up, I
can only say that we must take Dante as we find him, and allow him to
be his own interpreter.  It is just those ideal heights of
contemplation which made it necessary, in his mind, to settle this
problem of the two governments -- the relation of the temporal and
spiritual powers as revealed in Christ.  Contemplation is possible,
says Aquinas, only under certain conditions.  One is, as we saw a
little ago, `rest from the disturbing forces of passion' in the
individual; but another is a corresponding peace in the community,
`rest from exterior troubles, which is the whole aim of civil life and
government.'  `Thus,' he adds, `if we look at things rightly, we may
see that all human occupations seem to be ministerial to the service of
the contemplators of truth' [^Contra Gentiles~, iii. 37].  This seems
to be exactly Dante's contention in the remaining Cantos.  They are
occupied almost exclusively with this question of the two governments,
or, to state it in terms of his symbolism, the relations of the Chariot
and the Tree.  So long as they fought and claimed each other's
jurisdiction, they destroyed that condition of `rest from exterior
troubles,' without which there could be no contemplation of Divine
things from the mass of men.  So far, therefore, from being a fall from
ideal heights, the right settlement of the relation of Church and State
is the necessary preliminary to the reaching of such heights at all. 
There is no Earthly Paradise, no world of quiet in which the
contemplative life is possible, until the two governments reach the
ideal which Dante saw in the mirror of the emerald eyes: each
fulfilling its function of reflecting the light of the Incarnation
within the perfect and unbroken peace of Christ.

	|131-138.~  This interpretation seems to be confirmed by the next
stage in Dante's vision of Beatrice.  The three Theological Virtues now
advance, `dancing to their angelic roundelay':

     `Turn, Beatrice, turn thy holy eyes,'
     Such was their song, `unto thy faithful one,
     Who has to see thee moved so many steps.
     In grace do us the grace that thou unveil
     To him thy mouth, so that he may discern
     The second beauty which thou dost conceal.'

The first beauty is that of her eyes which we have just examined -- the
beauty of the active life under the two governments of Church and
Empire in their true ideal relations, as revealed by the four natural
virtues.  The second beauty is that of her mouth, the `holy smile'
(xxxii.5) of her `persuasions,' the inner light of wisdom by which she
is able to `imparadise the mind' [^Par.~ xxviii. 3]: in other words,
without the aid of the three supernatural virtues.  We are surprised at
first to hear them call Dante `thy faithful one'; but it helps us to
understand what he meant by forgetting his sins.  It is not that they
are absolutely blotted out of his mind, but rather that they are now
transfigured by the grace of God.  In the light of where he now stands
he sees that underneath all his wanderings there was a soul of goodness
in his evil, an unconscious faithfulness which guided his many steps
back to the contemplation of her face. 

	|139-145.~  And then she unveils, and all poetic speech is
powerless to tell her second beauty:

     O splendour of living Light Eternal!
     Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus
     Hath grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,
     He would not seem to have his mind encumbered
     Trying to render thee as thou appearedst,
     There where, harmonizing, the heaven o'ershadowed thee,
     When in the open air thyself thou didst disclose?

[Dante uses the word `splendour' always in one definite sense, as
explained in ^Conv.~ iii. 14: `The custom of the philosophers is to
call Heaven ^light~ (^lume~), in so far as it exists in its primal
fountain; to call it a ^ray~ (^raggio~), in so far as it exists in the
medium between its source and the first body by which it is arrested;
to call it a ^splendour~ (^splendore~), in so far as it is thrown back
on some other part which it illuminates.'  The constant and essential
idea of ^splendour~, therefore, is that of light received from God and
^reflected~ to another -- not direct vision of Himself.  See ^Par.~ xi.
39; xxix. 13-18; xxx. 97, etc.]  A great deal of unnecessary conjecture
has gathered round these lines.  There is no need to drag in, as so
many do, the music of the spheres, the harmony of which is a symbol or
shadow of the unveiled beauty of Beatrice.  Nor is it the idea that
Heaven in some general sense, `harmonizing with the land of Innocence,
with difficulty shadows forth the emblem of the Divine Beauty.'  The
meaning is quite plain.  The heaven of which Dante is thinking is
obviously that of the seven streamers of light from the seven golden
candlesticks, which overshadowed the whole Procession [^Purg.~ xxix.
82: `Beneath so fair a heaven'].  The light was broken up into the
colours of the rainbow representing the seven gifts of the Spirit of
God.  Up to this time Dante had evidently not felt their unity, but
regarded each as isolated from its companions.  Now that Beatrice
unveils her `holy smile' the ^harmony~ of all spiritual gifts
with one another, and with the entire Revelation for which she stands,
enraptures him beyond all words.  She is the `splendour of the living
Light Eternal,' the unity of `the many-coloured wisdom of God' in the
heaven that streams above her head.  `Wisdom reacheth from one end to
another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.  I loved her
and sought her from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I
was a lover of her beauty.'  `She passeth and goeth through all things
by reason of her pureness.  For she is the breath of the power of God,
and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore
can no defiled thing fall into her.  For she is the brightness of the
everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the
image of His goodness.  And being but one, she can do all things: and
remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages
entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and
prophets.  For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.  For
she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars:
being compared with the light, she is found before it' [Wisdom of
Solomon viii. 1, 2; vii. 24-29].
